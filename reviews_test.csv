She is one of the worse providers I have been to, hands down. 
Also she refused to do MRI even though I have PA for years. she ordered X-Rays of parts of body that I have no pain. Very weird.  My Physical therapist was surprised by her lack of care. 
rude and unprofessional. Of all things she rigorously shook my hand-- knowing I have terrible hand/ joint pain. Really??   Just goes to show, her level of ignorance."
NbigxJ5d_wNk92Wm_2lF8Q,xVd0b2ryzceCcBPw1l-33g,"Called them this morning at 8:15.  They called back a little over an hour later.  They were here a little after 10:00 and done by 11:30.  They fixed a problem that many others had tried to and couldn't.  They, also, fixed two serious leaks.  I am very happy with them and will be working with them in the future."

Entirely unprofessional doesn't even begin to describe their phone manner. Nobody is willing to accept responsibility for their horrible INCONSISTENT AND UNRELIABLE service. Do your self a favour and absolutely DO NOT give this company your money, they don't deserve it. Absolute waste of time. I cannot wait to see this company go out of business. I wish I could give this company ZERO STARS"
IMWyxjhlrlitZvt-4GLo3g,sreDEUoT6peIM1QdZEbg7A,"Lisa recently helped my husband and I with our newborn son. She is amazing with babies and in general. She was a great help in easing us into parenthood and helping us with proper baby care. She also an amazing person just to have adult interaction with when you are a stay at home mom and craving social interaction!! My son loves Lisa, he would fall asleep upon her arrival almost every time. I would highly recommend post partum doula services from Lisa and her team for first time parents or any mothers that are worried about post partum life."

They recently moved 2 blocks away to 1508 4th Street SW.
This is just a block north of 17th ave sw on 4th St.

He is very friendly and professional. I am a pretty big guy and since he takes care of the ASU football team I figured he could handle me.  Nice clean facility and easy yo get an appointment.  Highly recommend.

RyupMPEgqaIW2abzMw2TLw,TYRJ0l8BJQZyExcqXObrSQ,The rudest experience as a customer I have ever experienced. I went in to by a cowboy hat as remembrance of my trip. Ya kind of touristy  was told I was a wannabe. I gave the clerk the opportunity to be less rude saying you you got to admit I look good in it. Her reply was still a wannabe. Straight face no smile. I thought am I really hearing this. Is this how you treat paying customers? Came back and returned the hat. No apologies. All i gotta say wow.
izOgTz2GgHABbK42C97wNw,hq8OJ7owwbTUaFJHhJ5e-A,"Let me start by saying that I have been a customer at AOK! for about 5 years.  I enjoy the classes offered, there is a great variety and they staff/teachers are friendly. After 5 years, you would think that my business would be appreciated.  Nope.  I purchased a package in January of 2016 - it was access to all classes (Zumba, TRX, Barre, Ride, etc.) for $199 for four months.  The policy known at the gym is once you start your package that it starts calculating your time that day.  Well....what if someone at check in made a mistake and inadvertently signed you in for a class you never took?  Well, that happened to me.  I messaged today to check and see if everything was ok with starting my package and was informed I only have 18 days left.  I have never used this package!!! I had surgery at the time they say I used the package - not possible!  After several e-mails with one of the owners, Kim, she was not willing to hear me out and accused me of being ""one of many who purchase packages and never use them"".  Let me tell you, I work HARD for my money and am not just going to throw around $199.  I am so disappointed to have been treated this way.  Even if they did make this right, I am so upset and displeased I am not sure I would even want to go back.  Very sad AOK."
DE6QVNI4iShtRfbCVuEOiA,sQu3SrMtPhTpp9HRFAcF2A,"I've known this place since it opened in the original location about 10 years ago.  I've seen it go through two ownership changes as well, but I have to say that it is now so badly run that I don't even bother visiting.  The staff seem asleep on their feet and the owner/manager can't seem to be bothered to make sure that  the place is stocked each day.  on more than one occasion, the staff have had to turn customers away or even shut down in order to replenish basic items.  On top of that, they can't make a half-decent espresso or keep track of orders, so there isn't much point in going unless you like the location."

ufKEWP_6GYUwkupXsybmNw,p7HMe4REUwSHn9in8mUQMQ,"Nice, clean and friendly gas station. The gas price is reasonable for which the station is located. This might be a minor thing but I like is they have free air, which other gas stations charge for $1 just to put in air for your car. They also got good choices of snacks and drinks."
3tJA6wUCG1nerLOH8EIcQw,79Wy5uBAFXUplKq-rxfuFA,"I came in for a pedicure with shellac on my feet. Right off the bat, the girl started ripping the shellac off with a cuticle cutter and filing down my nails with an electric filer making my nails bumpy and uneven. She continued with scrubbing my heels and I had to ask her to redo it 3 times because my feet were still extremely dry. (I still left with dry cracked heels.) she didn't file my nails correctly and they were bumpy and uneven. She went on to paint my toenails. As she was putting on the base coat she was getting it all over my feet and went on to paint my toenails and got it all over my cuticles. I asked her to fix where it was on my cuticles and she said she will clean it up later. After she finished painting them, she cleaner them up and they still looked horrible so I asked her to re do it. Again, she is rushing through it and gets the base coat all over my feet and cuticles and slaps more polish on and it still looks horrendous. She told me that that's how that color is.. So i asked if another girl can apply the polish on my nails. The other girl said that my nails were bumpy and I told her it was because the other girl had ripped off the shellac off my toenails and filed them like that. She applied polish on 2 nails and the job was already so messed up that I decided I didn't want any color and just asked her to file the tops more evenly. She did but they still looked horrible and I left with pinkish bumpy nails and dry heels. And they made me pay on top of all of this. Definitely the worst pedicure I have ever received and am never going back there again."

I've had better steak in a sandwich from coffee trucks. Service was terrible and food even worse. This place has turned into a dive."
qz_ITBt4T5nOSXgUjiOgkA,a-3qWtHY-X8D9kocRwOdDg,"I would not recommend this service to my worst enemy. They quoted us a price over the phone at $225. The person who answered the phone said that a man would call us to set an appointment for services to be rendered. About two days later the technician calls and sets the appointment for about four days later. He gets to the house looks around and leaves without doing anything, saying he may be able to fit us in on Wednesday (two days later). After repeatedly calling and leaving messages we finally tried calling from a different number and got the operator to tell us that the handy man would be getting us an estimate as soon as possible. So a couple of days after that we received an estimate of nearly three times what we were originally quoted. Because as he said via text message ""we also have more customers that have being waiting."" So after waiting a week we learned that homer the handy man has far too many similarities with one homer j Simpson. Our advice to homer would be stop overbooking your sham company in attempt to see who will pay triple what they were quoted at. This is textbook bait and switch at its worst."

Don't worry, I don't drive home. The wings are too greasy for me, but the sandwiches are yummy. I did order the steak that was on special, and it came out wrong. But I do NOT go there for the food. I like the tequila..."

While it doesn't have the comfy couches or armchairs that some of the others have, this starbucks is usually not as packed as others, making it a pretty good spot to bring along a laptop and get some work done."
7VsIM_8UyGuFIekzIstwxA,AK4edQUSCG5WTT8jc2reRw,"My husband and I went into this store on Saturday, May 3, 2014 and asked to see an item they had advertised in the paper. The salesman immediately said they do not advertise in the paper. I knew I had seen an ad in the paper for this item. After several minutes and this guy arguing with us that they do not advertise in the paper, he finally said it must have been in the Union County Weekly paper. I told him I thought that is where I saw it. Once he found the item for us, he was very condescending to me and a real smart aleck. My husband turned to me and said he would not buy anything in that store so once he showed us the item,we told him it was not what we thought it was and we left. We will not go back in that store again because of that salesman working there. I have never encountered a salesperson like that, anywhere."
Xc6rNkzF3sKeBDpLwy9EGQ,O4lRtiwNFXlSn8egpjC8Tw,Great little spot! The spa is clean and comfortable. The massage chair was great as well. I got a mani/pedi and the service was friendly with lots of attention to detail. The hot stone massage with the hot towel on my legs was an unexpected bonus! They have a good polish and shellac color selection as well. I am always happy to support neighborhood businesses and I will be back!
LUYB4fYZt5ZaitU4hXBDKg,w4SSyHI0vNnv8wKEtRv9EQ,"Just completed moving my parents and assisting them in downsizing to the Destinations Pueblo community.  I feel relaxed knowing that they are surrounded by plenty of  activities, beautiful grounds and that maintenance is just a phone call away.  

From the start, Romeo was a true champion in helping us find the right unit and helped complete the process from start to finish with a ""smile"". Romeo truly shows compassion for the residents and the community.  Renee the activities director is always so friendly and inviting mom and dad to participate in events.

Thank you , Destinations Pueblo!  I know my parents are thrilled  and will have a long term stay at your property."

RpKcS_S3u4WcTrTcgsQJpA,dQLuSRnbKPsdYTbkPcAgNw,"Jenna Renshaw and her team are the best thing to ever happen to my sweet boxer Brody. She knows her stuff, she is up front, and the best part, she comes to YOU (for an insanely reasonable price by the way). I never really felt like I had full confidence in any vet I ever took him to, and in larger clinics I always felt like they just wanted to up sell me. Jenna is straight forward and as good as they come. I will never take Brody anywhere else, and I literally refer EVERYONE to her, and they are all only bummed they didn't know about her sooner once they see her. Don't waste any more time at any other vet in the valley, call Assisi Veterinary Service NOW."

They connected it to our propane generator but we couldn't get the generator to run. They worked with our generator supplier to troubleshoot the problem and made several trips out to our place (way out in the desert) and didn't give up until the generator was running. And all without losing their friendly, profession attitude."
1kA3M9bZAQlB_r3ivWtDiA,2eqpw0ogJz7LeItMUg6T5w,"Today I was driving along Pharmacy Ave and had a disturbing encounter with a van labeled clearly ""Bark Bus"", barkbus.ca.  The male driver who was on route with his dog clientele came speeding out of a residential street, running a stop sign and nearly killing my wife sitting in the passenger side of my vehicle.  

It seemed as though his sunglasses were too dark, or he was drunk on the job.   He ignorantly proceeded to drive along Pharmacy going approx 100km on a 50 km zone sticking up his middle finger.

Unfortunately he was speeding  fast that I didn't follow, had I, I would have followed to contact each client of his and report that their giving their precious Dogs to someone not fit for work.  

To those out there using this service, your spending your hard earned money to put your dog  in a death vehicle.  
I have taken the license plate and will report to police with my dash cam video."

00kW9yjLlphQLoh7G_3i5w,gFS744rq4r8cAccnqkBTtw,"I was just at Enterprise, of course to pick up a rental car. Upon arriving there, we were trying to park and an employee driving a car tried to cut around us to park before us, which resulted in him almost hitting us. When we went inside, we told them what had happened. The manager ignored us. The guy who almost hit us made excuses. And another employee walked up towards us trying to come off as imposing and threatening. We were not looking for a fight, were not children, but that's the way he was behaving. After the guy rolled his eyes and made a fake apology, he walked away, and the manager acted as though nothing happened and changed the subject. And then calling the store afterwards, she claimed that the issue had been resolved and that everyone had sincerely apologized which was not the case. Luckily my mother in law works for a major insurance company and will be able to lodge a formal complaint with corporate. I would not recommend going here, obviously."

Will definitely use again and already referred him to our daughter for some plumbing work.
T73s6Awa0Xl9UFwmKf2Llg,DVhx3gSWQDEOzW71YijeAw,"I highly recommend PFD. Similar to a previous reviewer, I began working out with Chris before he opened his gym. I stuck with him because he is super knowledgeable, not just about fitness, but about nutrition as well. He was able to give me a lot of useful advice regarding how to modify my diet to best meet my fitness goals. In addition, both he and the rest of the staff are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and accommodating.

I know that crossfit-style training is not for everyone, but I personally loved the difficulty and variation in the workouts I participated in at PFD. Don't get me wrong, my body was totally thrashed at first, but Chris did a great job of adjusting the difficulty of the workout to my level, and I found that I was able to make progress fairly quickly."
yFPzEBhRlq052edZZgVcBA,C22rh1e3AtkVLjT3QWWRyQ,"I have had a very frustrating experience with this doctor's office. The hold times on the phone are atrocious. I have been left on hold for 20-40 minutes or more several times. They do not even apologize for the wait time when they return on the line. Also, the wait time to see the doctor exceeds 45-60 minutes each time. I always arrive on time and end up waiting far too long. Furthermore, they are slow to refill prescriptions that the pharmacy faxes to them for approval. Therefore, I spend each month without my medication for a few days, causing insomnia and hassle with the doctors office monthly. I am currently looking for a new doctor and would never suggest anyone go here for their medical needs. I have been extremely dissatisfied with this medical practice."

Getting an appointment was easy, and the enrollment forms were electronic and not overly lengthy. The waiting room time was minimal and they set both girls up for appointments at the same time so we weren't there an hour and trying to keep one entertained while the other got her teeth cleaned and checked. Most importantly, everyone from the front desk, to the hygienist, to Dr. Jason made my girls feel comfortable and welcome. It wasn't at all scary or intimidating and my girls actually enjoyed their visit. I had to practically pull them out the door to leave because they were having so much fun playing while I checked out. We've already got our six month follow-up scheduled!"
xR0gTs0I3FHIFzNmt3NJ_A,NtWoJ66Qv83k_7-_ciI6TQ,"Was referred here by a friend. Asked for a very simple hairstyle that was wash and wear (I do not own a blow dryer and do not wish to get one)  simple bob at shoulder length... left with an ear length chop job whose poor quality was hidden by a very proficient blowdry that hid the unevenness of the cut and the layering I SPECIFICALLY ASKED NOT TO HAVE. Extremely disappointed - worst haircut I have ever had, it would have looked better if I had done it on my own with a blindfold. I now have the choice of getting an even shorter cut or look like hell until it grows out - not a happy choice. I hate short hair.

Forgot to add: the stylist I used here has been cutting hair for years... it was not a Jr.  Stylists or newbie... completely disappointing that the first cuts were made in a way that there was no turning back from the length the stylist wanted to do rather than what I had requested. Didn't listen or didn't care... either way I spent a lot of money... for the original haircut and then at a different salon to correct the hatchet job... I didn't even have to tell the stylists at O in Olgivy's why I was there... they guessed immediately without being told that I was trying to repair a bad haircut... except that they could NOT believe I had paid for it at a professional salon."

I told her that the other three of us only had sampled once, she then said "" 3 samples per family""!!!  I was shocked! !!  Does she expect us to share the samples?  What if the family has 6 members, do they share 3 spoons of samples???  If this is their company policy, I think it is a big problem!!

I went In seeking a new watch band and they didn't have my size and style in stock - fair enough.  But the woman who seemed to be in charge, and had a snooty air about her, told the clerk who was helping me to take my phone number and she would call me back.  The following day I happened to be walking by so went in. Snooty lady wasn't in and apparently had still not dealt with my simple request.  In short, they basically told me that it would be faster I went elsewhere!  I told them that I lived in the area and did want to support local businesses but that I was less than impressed with their level of service and that there was a distinct change in customer service with the new staff.  Sales clerk #3 said they really wanted to please their customers and would do better - but they could help me with my watch band.  Some businesses just don't deserve to survive!"

The father was very courteous. It was the younger Korean woman (daughter?) who was very lippy and had attitude. For example, I placed my ID on the counter w/my packing slip, not realizing she didn't look at the ID. I put it back and when she asked for my ID, I asked ""Oh, didn't I already give it to you?""  She barked back ""NO. You put it on the counter. You did NOT give it to me. That's not the same."" 

Do you really need to give this much attitude? I can go on with other examples, but won't.  So beware and hope you'll get the father instead."
RtwXPsSQYSJR7hZe58bgqQ,mETtUVUFeDQnoyr51FYDYg,"I went to this club back in February 12, 2011 for Valentine's Day to see Gerardo Ortiz. It was all over facebook that this was the new ""hot"" place for events of this magnitude. I had prepaid $200 to reserve a table two weeks prior to the engagement and purchased 5 tickets valued at $45 each (presale). The day of the event (which was sold out) there was a line of people from the door of the club all the way out to the curb for two and a half hours. There was no parking, and I had to park close to the railroad tracks almost hitting McDowell/Grant Ave and 23rd Ave. When we were able to get in, I could not find a server/manager anyone that could take me to my table. That was not the worst part. The beer was sold out! On my way to the restroom I see one of the organizers and ask him abut the reserved table situation. He said "" I don't know what to tell you man, thats not my problem"". The promoter was standing right next to him, nobody else was around and there was no music playing. Instead of offering to resolve this issue, he stares at me blankly, and puts his cell phone to his ear. Do your best to avoid any events being promoted by ""Guito Rivera"" especially at this location. There was not enough security, TEN fights broke out, many people were waiting to get in, no alcohol, or place to sit. Needless, to say we didn't stay long.The next day I went back to the place where I had paid my $200 table and found myself waiting in line with two young men who had also ""lost"" their table.

They have failed to accurately include upcoming taxes, failed to include county tax at all, and have resulted in our mortgage climbing consistently over the last two years.  

If you build with Maronda, they will push you to use this company.  Do not fall for the perceived pressure.  Find your own closing company - someone you can trust.

G7o_8ePJQt3Ev6oMrl2Wxw,tfP9gClFC4gXcAPerYK1wg,"very expensive for what you get. Dont expect to cook much. You will do part of part of the meal. 

pros- marni's plant-based meals are definitely healthy, whole food based and tasty

cons- you will hardly cook in these cooking classes. In the daylong classes you will not cook more than in the evening ones. if the price wasnt high enough she also has people come in and push their merchandise during your paid for time. sometimes they give a small sample, sometimes not even a discount. 
In addition when she gets off cooking into "" food guru"" mode she is not reliable at all. She seems to go off into "" magical thinking"" without any back up data. For example she says eggs are bad for you but somehow good if you eat the white and yolk separately. ( no explanation for this odd bit of advice)  In her book there is disinformation that is dangerous. She says that it is not necessary to take vit D in Canada, which is wrong if you look at all the hard data, She then says if your doctor insists then  take 400 IU daily , which is far too little to prevent osteoporosis or other conditions. 

Also there are 3 sinks in the kitchen but she wont let anyone wash their hands in any of them before or after handling food. Instead she sends you down two hallways to a little washroom which is not very clean. 


So enjoy the food but take the rest with a large grain of salt. She should spend more time letting people actually cook."

The driver was friendly, the limousine itself was great (30 person ""party bus"") and timings were met. The only drawback was that the heater seemed either faulty or old because it took awhile for the bus to heat up (despite it being about 5 degrees outside). Overall, the interior was pretty sweet and everyone was comfortable.

What started as a pleasant experience upgrading my wife's diamond wedding bad turned into a nightmare as the stone fell out of the new setting after four months.

Never mind that her previous ring held up for twenty-five YEARS before they got their hands on it! Needless to say she came home in tears.

Qs8F5UsN_iLDCFkIjeyZbg,twTVsfusCEb_g_Nfyc7E1w,"I hadn't been to a Blush Lane store before, it's fairly similar to other high end grocery stores in that they focus on pre-packaged food and don't have much fresh fruit or vegetables. They do have an expanded range of choices versus other stores in some areas; for example, they have quite a good selection of spices and pre-packaged flours of different varieties. 

There is a small bulk selection with a few kinds of dried fruit, although it is mostly snack food rather than the whole food type ingredients you'd find in an organic store. They also have a small cheese counter, which nevertheless has a few interesting varieties of cheese. 

I would never consider doing my actual food shopping here, as their prices are very high (based on a few items I saw that are available in regular grocery stores elsewhere in the neighbourhood, anywhere from 50-100% higher). However, it's nice to have a store within walking distance where I can get nutritional yeast and maybe a good piece of cheese for a treat once in a while."

Perfect for kids, I had a hard time choosing my little conure. I had an excellent experience in this store.  It was clean, and I could tell the birds were healthy and happy. Though their food prices are a little bit more expensive than cheaper pet store alternatives, they make up for it with constant discounts and deals.  My only complaint is that I have found a few little bugs in the bulk food I've bought from them, but even that can be easily solved by keeping the food in the freezer.  Staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and I could tell the owner and her daughters(?) really cared for the birds.  They explained to me why they only cut the first few feathers so the birds can stop themselves from falling, and only once they are old enough (since babies need to be able to fly to develop correctly).  The people below must have been at a different shop cause I'm convinced these people would never wean a bird before it's time or do anything to endanger their birds.  If you want to support a small business that has good ethics and truly cares for their birds (who wouldn't?) then I would highly recommend them."

zdv667Zq-_PFWtTZsNQ_Vw,gRZ69-Fm7PKtUjxIr_ff7A,"I've had 6 different dentists over my lifetime.  Dr. Devore is by far the best.  He is so good I looked him up when he moved from his previous practice group.  

All my dentists gave good looking results but Dr Devore is better at pain management than any dentist I ever had.  He really cares that you aren't in pain while he works.  I've had a couple of caps, a root canal.  No pain in either.  Even a filling in a front tooth (everyone knows how sensitive they are) with no pain.  No pain even with the needle for the anesthetic before the drilling.

Prices seem to be no better or worse than any other dentist so I don't have much to compare there but I don't look for cheap anyway when I want a doctor or dentist.  I just want good treatment at a fair price.

He has pretty good office hours (for me at least).  I always get late afternoon appointments -- sometimes as late as 6:30 PM.  Nice to be able to go after work.  This might be because Dr. Devore teaches at the dental school.  Maybe in the mornings?  It's nice to know the guy is so good he teaches the other dentists.

By the way, he has a great hygienist in the office too."

Long story...trying to make it shorter...our boat took a dump in the middle of Lake Pleasant and after getting it water-towed and back home and it started right away,  we had a mystery on our hands.  My husband was determined to fix it himself and understand the boat, and everyone at Performance Marine supported that cause.  From Sue at the desk to Brent the mechanic (more like genius)...my husband was back and forth with them for a month.  He called them, he stopped by...and they were always willing to help and go the extra mile to help us fix it.  Every time my husband found a problem, another problem was uncovered...it sucked but having Performance Marine on our side was an absolute miracle!

The atmosphere is nice, the servers were friendly, and the drinks were good.

The floors were extremely sticky. My shoes kept getting glued to the floor, I had to keep moving them. The dance floor is very small and it's right in between the VIP/Reserved area so it makes it kind of hard to dance. The whole place is small but the dancing area was crowded.

FOLWEfZJzPiYWne3_60Ikw,neqY5Lr8ZSPMYVW7AlSqmA,"With all the fed rates plummeting, and my money barely earning more than inflation in my Wamu savings account, I decided to transfer a large portion of my savings over to Arizona Bank & Trust.  

**I interrupt this review for an important news flash: Arizona Bank & Trust currently has a 6.01% APY rewards checking account with a $20K cap on it. This blows away any online savings account out there, and best of all the money is liquid -- you can access it at any time you please. There are three basic requirements: 

1) Sign up for e-statements (easy - and one of the bankers will call you up and help walk you through it if you have trouble with it. If you're on Yelp, I figure you can navigate a computer though).  

2) Make 12 signature-based debit transactions a month. This means don't use your pin, and run it as a credit card. You can buy 12 packs of gum. Or buy 10 cents worth of gas 12 times. You can also use it to pay online utilities. This is not a hard requirement to fulfill, really. 

3) Direct depost OR ACH bill pay. This is great, because as a student, I don't have easy access to direct deposit, so I just used my AZB&T account to pay my Cox cable bill online - just make sure to use your bank account # and routing # to pay the bill, because if you use your debit card # it will NOT go through as an ACH debit.

The other thing that makes this deal a beauty is that the 6.01% rate is guaranteed until April 2009. Guaranteed. 12 blissful months of earning twice as much interest as my stinky online savings accounts. 

So after doing my research, I headed on over to the AZB&T branch down the street from me. From the moment I stepped through the door, I received very attentive service. I've had a bit of experience signing up for bank accounts, and the process was similar to most. Unfortunately, the day I was there the entire computer system had shut down, so they had to hand write my application and enter it after I left. Also, my initial deposit slip was handwritten -- which seemed a bit shady. And sure enough, the next day I noticed $2000 had been taken out of my other bank account, not the full $20,000 that I had written the deposit check for. AZB&T immediately caught their error though, requested the remaining amount, and it was in my account within the next couple of days.

Based on my initial experience, you'd think I would rate the bank poorly, but even through all the mishaps the bankers were very apologetic and professional and they followed up with several calls throughout the next week.  In fact, I have definitely gotten on a first name basis with a couple of the bankers there, and every time I call, I just have to say my full name and they know immediately who I am. I haven't gotten this kind of personalized service since leaving my teeny tiny hometown in Hickville, AZ. 

The only reason I wouldn't give my experience at AZB&T 5 stars is because the whole application process from beginning to end is a bit on the slow side, and the computers crashing was a bit of a nuisance. The friendliness and accessibility of the staff, however, has made it a real pleasure to bank here despite the few hiccups. I sent my friend over to sign up, and he's had no issues so far.

WNQHZracQ-gAvK8F9-TpFA,NZYt9CSnkO39RJpYEa1juw,"This company is nothing but a bunch of crooks and slumlords.  As the other two reviews state, you will never have anything fixed on your property.  They will cheat you out of your damage deposit. When we moved in to the upper portion of a house, there was a nice older couple living in the basement. (Which I should mention, is an illegal suite)   We paid 60% of utilities which came to about $50-$80/mo.  It was fair.  Shortly after we moved in a family of four moved in downstairs and our utilities went up to $400/mo.  This company lied to the tenants downstairs and said we did not have a dog, which we do, and the tenants are terribly afraid of dogs.  This resulted in a very uncomfortable and later, hostile living arrangement.  When we lived there the rent was 1150/mo, and was put up to $1200/mo before we left.  The woman that did the walk-through when we moved out said that they would be charging the new tenants $1500/mo for the run down place. One of the lower tenants threatened me and said they would kill me, I reported it to the police and Drummer Realty, and they did nothing. I called to report the lower tenants on numerous occasions, for playing loud music, for filling the house with smoke (Due to setting a tea towel on fire by leaving in on the stove with burner turned on, this happened several times.) For not ONCE taking out the garbage or recycling (which is a shared responsibility)  For parking in front of our garage and causing loss of wages because we couldn't leave for work, for never cleaning the lint tray in the shared dryer (Also a fire hazard) for throwing garbage in the backyard, and also our neighbour had complained because the tenants were throwing milk jugs at her dogs in her yard. Whenever I called to complain Drummer would call the downstairs tenants to ask them about these issues, and the tenants would say ""Well their dog is barking all the time."" So Drummer would call us back telling us to keep the dog under control.  The dog only barked because they teased him through our back entrance, and they also were coming and going at all hours of the night. Drummer tried to charge us for a month after we moved out, somehow not realizing we were no longer residing at one of their properties.  They also tried to overcharge us several times for utilities.

I could go on forever, but the bottom line is, Drummer is very unprofessional and unreasonable to deal with.  We had been looking for a new place to live but due to the floods it was difficult with so many people displaced.  We are happy and lucky to be out of there, and just wanted to warn others about this terrible company.

Renters beware."

fQv_HqZHVlLuRe7ypbg1eQ,maQmz_iRwPLzU1_qGjUN6A,"So as an update....KNC found some way to have my negative review deleted.  It was probably the reference to the excellent contractor that removed KNC's unacceptable work and made the repairs correctly, or perhaps it was my email link to view pictures of KNC's ""repairs"" so the viewer could decide for themselves.  I only posted the contractor's information because KNC claimed they weren't licensed and ""didn't exist.""  They do exist.  They were great.  KNC wasn't.  No problem, I'll remove those references and repost my original review.  Here it is:

WOW!!  This just gets better and better!  Not only does KNC Contracting perform unacceptable work (in my opinion), they are also willing to create an alternate reality in response to an honest review.  What exactly did I lie about?  The statement that I never signed a contract because my insurance company set me up with you (in retrospect, that should have been a huge red flag)?  The statement that your employees showed up unannounced?  The statement that your employees jumped my locked gate to perform work (because I didn't know they were coming despite my requests for notification)?  The statement that, on the one occasion they did show up when I was actually home, they had to borrow my ladder and hand tools to complete roofing work?  The statement that KNC's unacceptable work had to be replaced?  The statement that I refused to pay for unacceptable work?  The statement that I never met or spoke with you, that you have never been to my home, but you testified to events for which you were never even present?  But you call me a liar???

In my opinion, it seems that the only thing KNC is actually good at constructing is a story to justify its actions.  I realize you're terribly concerned about a poor review, but seriously, your condescending reply is hilarious.  The single thing the ""legal system"" (small claims court) confirmed was that KNC worked on my roof.  That's it.  I never disputed that - only that the work was so bad I refused to pay for it.  There was no decision on the quality of the work.  That will be up to the Registrar of Contractors to decide (complaint issued).  Most contractors would have admitted their repairs were unacceptable work and moved on.  But not KNC.  I hope it was worth it.  It was never about the money - it was about unacceptable repairs for which I had to pay an unrelated contractor to remove and replace.  Through your testimony related to events for which you had no part, you won the small claims case.  Congratulations.  You've now been paid in full.  

Now you can get back to those 2,500 - 3,500 jobs you claim to perform each year (you do realize that's between 7 and 9 jobs per day, every day of the week, every week of the year don't you?).  Man you guys are efficient!!  Maybe that's why your employee had to borrow my tools to do the job.  You can move soooo much faster without the burden of actually carrying your own equipment!!

By the way, the ""unlicensed"" roofing contractor you referred to is licensed, honest, and does fantastic work.  Their name is DELETED.  For anyone looking for excellent roofing repairs, I recommend contacting them at DELETED.  DELETED will take care of your needs and stand behind their product.

As far as KNC and their work, I've set up an email to assist those who would like to see the quality of the repairs KNC performed on my roof.  I'll be happy to send high resolution, detailed pictures of the job.  I'll let you decide if you want to spend your hard earned dollars with KNC.  

The email address is:  DELETED.

As far as the $1,700, you've now been paid in full.  I suggest you use the money to buy a ladder, some hand tools, a Bible (some really great suggestions on how to best deal with people), and a crash course on how to properly repair a roof."

MGEU0jIh-b-cLZhXyCQr6w,aZYLVCbKu9hxoId21aG7lQ,"My car was experiencing transmission problems and I was recommended to this business.  I contacted Carolina Car Care and was quoted a price that included a two-year warranty.  I had the car towed to Carolina Car Care. When the work was completed and I picked up the car, the check engine light was on which was not on before.  I drove the car home and the following morning, I noticed the car would hesitate before going forward.  Shortly afterwards, there was a rattling noise from underneath the car.  I took the car back and learned they did not do the transmission work but unbeknownst to me, they sent it to a transmission shop that I later learned through researching Google reviews and yelp, was an undesirable place to have a rebuilt transmission installed.  I was told by Carolina Car Care the noise was from the transfer case and it did not have anything to do with the transmission.

They suggested I replace the transfer case at a cost of $1300.00 and suggested I not drive the car because it could adversely affect the warranty.  I decided to take the car to the dealer.  The dealer said there was nothing wrong with the transfer case and the check engine light was on because when the transmission was installed they yanked the knock sensor wire loose.  I paid the dealer nearly $500.00 to correct this issue and the light went out.  The dealer discovered that the rattling noise was caused because the car had very little oil when I got the car back from Carolina Car Care.

I returned to Carolina Car Care and asked to be reimbursed for the cost of the knock sensor.  Initially they said they would pay the money but they never did.  After filing a small claims action, the owner, John, came to court and   testified how many times he talked to me and how the light was on when they got the car.  The problem was, I had never seen John before and never talked to him.  

I appealed the case and won via arbitration and Carolina Care Care refused to pay the award.  I had to file a writ of execution and eventually, the Union County Sheriff executed the writ and froze their bank account and I was finally reimbursed.  Now I have a warranty where they want to send it back to the undesirable transmission and a transmission that does not work properly."

Mc93nbe-tJFOxFxKNbC7ug,RVHJFIeeEmzVaPWN-GNXvw,"Kat was so wonderful to work with! She was  very sweet and she actually took the time to meet with me and my dog prior to even scheduling the photo shoot. My dog does not like new people at all but she quickly warmed up to Kat. Kat was also amazing in that she really listens to you. She listen about what type of photos I wanted with my dog, the back drop, and feel for the pictures. She looked at multiple places and found the trail head that was perfect! She was so patient with my dog and us as we don't usually do photo shoots and not very photogenic. She captured my dogs personality and both my husband and mine as well in her photos. She spent so much time with us and took so many pictures! So just the photo session was already awesome. 

When it came to the editing she and I communicated through text and she was always responsive (within 24 hours). She sent examples for the layout of the book and canvas. She was very accommodating with my busy work schedule and flexible with me. Another thing that impressed me with Kat was her timeliness for the project. I understand things take time, but she gave me a time line and stuck to it. That is important as my other photographer/videographer (Corey H) still have not given us our wedding video and it is a week or so shy of the one year mark...

Finally... the product we got in the mail was amazing! Kat made sure we received it and was there to follow up. The cherry on the top was when I got the book. She is definitely a professionally and take pride in her work. The book was wrapped and had a thank you note plus a beautiful ribbon. Most people would sent you a box and be done but that extra detail made my day! I honestly have dealt with a lot of good and bad people, but I can be confident to say Kat really is professional and the addition to detail makes every dollar count. You get what you pay for and she is very fair especially with the product she produce!"

fXIt9fJlwYpgccvV-rqm7w,5TsBpJRvxCA54ELkQLIphg,"Update since writing.  I've gotta downgrade to one star.  I had an itch to start calling around to see if the practice described below was common in the industry.  It was not.  I called 3 other places (that didn't have the Scottsdale address) and pricing ranged from $125-$175 with a 3 year warranty.  There was no talk of needing to remove stationary doors or anything else.  They explained what they did properly without deception.   I am open to talking to the owner if he cares to discuss this matter further with me.  Their practices are deceptive no matter how you slice it.  Their competitors are not.

From here below is my original review:

These guys are around the corner from me so I figured I'd keep it local if I could.  Kinda wish I'd shopped it around instead.  Woulda, shoulda, coulda...

I called and spoke to a gentleman hoping to get somebody to come out and look at my patio slider.  It was sticking quite a bit and had gotten so bad that it was a struggle to open or close.  Instead of them simply having somebody come out to diagnose it, the representative seemed to have it all figured out.  He explained that they need to take the stationary door out first and then take the slider out.  After that they need to inspect the rollers and the track before replacing whatever was broken.  He made sure that I knew that ""this is normally a two man job to take these 8 foot doors out,  but that Nick was well versed and strong and could do it alone.""  

I think you'll agree that this sounds like a pretty serious project.  And I was impressed that this guy knew all of the nuances required in order to get this slider moving freely again.  And to need to physically take out 2-8 foot high doors is a heck of a lot of work.  Certainly more than my usual handyman could take on...so despite my frustration at the cost ($275), I agreed.  I really had no idea that it would be so involved and even dangerous!

So the next day Nick rolls out at 8am (Nick was a great guy BTW) and we hit it off right away.  He comes in, and I run out for 5 minutes to get a cup of coffee at Circle K and by the time I get back he's pretty much done.  No doors needed to come out.  No 2 man job.  The whole pitch was seemingly just a way for the consumer to not feel so badly about this exorbitant cost for a 10-15 minute job.  

Nick unscrewed the frame at the bottom of the sliding door and was able to then maneuver the rollers to come out under that side and put new ones in.  He did use the big suction cups that you see glass people use in order to assist in this.  But other than that, he and I talked a bit but he was gone by 8:15.

Unlike most consumers, I did call the office and spoke to the receptionist Tiffany.  She assured me that Pat would get back to me which he did not.  When I called the following Monday I had to refresh her memory about everything pertaining to my issue and she finally connected me to somebody else who dropped my price to $225...so $50 reduction for a 15 minute job.

Its obvious that they realize that if they charged an $85 trip charge which comes off of the first half hour of labor (the way that most repair companies do out here), that they'd never collect that kind of dough.  

My gripe is this.  If you'd said that it costs $275 for us to fix your door regardless of whats wrong and a guy agrees, so be it.  But most consumers don't just bend over without knowing what they are bending over for.  That's why they were so proficient in outlining the extensive effort that goes into fixing my problem....truth is that the guy doesn't really know.  They don't want somebody to come out to diagnose it.  Heck...it could've been a rock stuck in the track.  

They describe a fictional strategy for how they NEED to repair your issue and gain agreement based on this grandiose story on the phone.  Once the consumer is overwhelmed with what ""the expert"" tells them is required, they gain agreement on the price.  Only problem is that the work involved that they described was a big lie.  What if my agreement to pay you was also a lie?  Wouldn't that then be a wash?

Deceptive practices are why I am slamming these guys.  There are a million ways that you can do what you do without compromising your integrity.  And lets face it, diagnosing over the phone isn't the answer.  Maybe you thought that it would require all of the stuff you said?  I really don't know.  But if you were wrong, don't ramrod the consumer when it was really a simple fix.   I'm a Realtor.  I'd give you referrals rather than a blasting.  Honesty and integrity go a long way out here.  I've built my business model on it."

a6HjZnNVqUN6ftyL5GFavg,seuCiuofyuyVDf4rskG6hA,"I bought an expensive bed from this store 2 1/2 weeks ago.  Unfortunately, the warehouse delivered and set it up with missing and broken pieces.  The store had the warehouse bring out new pieces, take apart the bed, and set it up again 4 MORE TIMES, yet they still had broken parts and pieces that did not fit.  Moreover, the last delivery crew did not know how to use a waterbed pump; I had to show them how to set it up and make it work.  The last straw in this fiasco was when the delivery crew wanted to drill holes to jury-rig the pieces to fit.  After 4 hours of dealing with them on this particular day, I gave up and I told them to take the bed back altogether.  When I contacted the store, they did not apologize for the poor service or anything.  Instead, they told me that they were ""done with it.""  Customer service is lacking, and poor quality of delivery crews.  Getting a refund has been a hassle.

Highlights:

- Comparatively cheap (~$7/hour for regular classes, $20/hour for semi private classes, and $28/hour for private classes) 
- Flexible schedules offered. (choose from: morning, evening, weekdays, weekends, part-time, full-time)
- Small class sizes. (Max 8)
- Walking distance from Wellesley Subway Station.
- Excellent instructors. Our instructors were actually from France as opposed to Quebec. (not that there's anything wrong with Quebec!)
- Course materials were presented in an orderly fashion and the instructors took the time to make sure each student understood everything being taught instead of rushing through the material. 
- Excellent customer service.

I've been to a few Booster Juice locations and sometimes my shake hasn't been mixed properly to the point where there are still chunks... I've had no issues with that here! This is a great location and I look forward to my next visit.

It's definitely not a natural look. The owner is a nice guy but hasn't responded after I told him I wasn't satisfied.

The people who are weighing your luggage are rude as well. There was an argument between one of them and myself, where he ripped $20 of ""extra"". I wanted to get my money back and they didn't want to give it. I went to another bus business and they weighed the same luggage and they gave me a different weight and did not charge me. Keep in mind these both bus places were charging the same amount for extra weight ( $1 per extra pound). Their bathrooms are nasty, but I wouldn't blame them it is just the people who use them. The seats are terrible, I would wake up with a stiffy. They would keep the screens on all night and it was impossible to sleep, even playing music.

_80vznYut7O0Vq6F5-95Zw,Xy6M5UCMWOjobsVV48UdJQ,I went to their cacao loft [their name for their Geary Avenue location] to get some gift/thrift packs and met some amazing people who helped me beyond expectations. With their advice I bought a couple of the Eating Chocolate Sample Packs [which contain 5 different 12-square bars for $20] plus a great big block of baking chocolate to make lots of yummy baked goods at home.  That's a lot of chocolate food for fifty bucks. The cacao loft is a very interesting space and I highly recommend dropping by; but keep in mind that it is their factory and not a store. Or catch them at one of the farmers' markets where they can talk to you about all of their products and the honesty with which they are made. It's truly a unique chocolate experience all around.

d-w5ZTjtPz8UV0wCDwko2Q,aaDIZZOc79fUhPnxkyZRJQ,"let me start out by saying, if you want to be disrepected after you fork over $10,600 to have 850 sqft of travertine and pavers installed...then call these clowns.

Initially I was very excited to do work with them, I saw their work at a model home, went to their website, liked what I saw immediately decided I wanted to work with them. I met with Brian who is the sleeziest sales guy ever BUT i was so blinded my by desire to turn my backyard into a liveable place i decided to push those thoughts aside. BAD MOVE. Note to self: follow your first instincts.

They came to the house with the digital drawing of our design, they make you initial in a million places on the drawing stating that you agree to what's going to be done. Which is no problem. During the process Brian admitted to us that his drawing was not exactly to spec and that the walk way leading from our RV gate to our back yard would be done correctly even though on the drawing it looked like was right up along side of the house.  So we said sure, as long as you know we want to be able  to walk in a relatively straight line from the RV gate to the backyard we're good. Well, that was the second mistake...

The laborers came out, did the installation and as they were laying the pavers we noticed that the pavers were laid right up against the side of the house. So you would have to walk through the RV gate make a sharp right and then walk with your shoulder grazing up against the side of the home to get to the back yard when there's  about 5 feet of dirt to your left. Made no effing sense.

So we told the laborers to stop and we called the foreman to tell him that they were not laying the pavers correctly and could they please let them know that the drawing is not to spec so they would need to move the pavers over 2 feet so that the walkway was centered with the RV gate. The foreman has Brian call us and when he calls, I answer my husband's phone and start explaining to him what the issue was. Told him everything else looked wonderful but they just need to move the pavers over slightly. And he says... I called to talk to your husband. (Jaw drop--- excuse me)

He then began to tell me that we signed the contract and the drawings approving the design the way it was and that if I wanted to not scrap my shoulder against the side of my house I would have to pay a change order fee to get the walkway moved over 2 feet. I told him that he admitted that the drawing was not to spec and we physically showed him exactly how we wanted it to look  and anyone with half a rat brain would know you don't want a walkway right up on the side of your home.  At which point being the intelligent person that he is, he proceeded to tell me that he knew I was the ""type"" of person that would do something like this, and he ""knew i would find something wrong with the work."" And that if he took this issue to the contractors board they would side with him. (Sigh) I had to threaten to withhold the final payment  and take him to court if he refused to move the walkway over.  Then he proceeded to come over to the house the next day and ask my husband if he thinks blooming desert should have to eat the cost of moving the walkway. I really almost lost it.

Our Experience with Brian and Blooming Desert was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I've never been treated that way by someone I handed a $10k+ check to in my life. He has NO idea what customer service is and he treats you like you're asking for a hand out. 

Long story short, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED. These guys, ESPECIALLY that Brian character are not honest business people... sheisters IMO. If you want to feel like you're begging them to work in your yard, on your their day off, for free be my guest but if you want a high quality professional experience stay very very very far away from these guys."

zM4VdWz2ln4eInxQsz33Xw,r9RSh0t67rIjXN3d8WC5DQ,"I was very unhappy with this store for a couple of reasons: poor service and dishonest pricing policy. I'm six months pregnant and went to Belly to look for some higher-end jeans, the J Brand Mama J line. I tried on a few pairs but they had limited sizes, none of which were working for me. No big deal, the saleslady let me know that they would be receiving a new shipment in a couple of weeks. I went back a couple of weeks later and she was absolutely correct - they had received a new shipment. The catch was that the exact same jeans had changed in price from $175 a couple of weeks before to $235 - a markup of nearly 33%. They even had a pair from the ""old"" shipment marked at $175. I asked the saleslady if they were different in any way to justify the change and she said that they had just been priced lower before. I asked if she would honor the original price that I had expected to pay since I had waited for the right size. I even pointed out that that I could have just bought the wrong size a couple of weeks ago and exchanged them if I had known that they would be increasing by $60.  She didn't really respond except to say that she would only have to honor the $175 price for the pair that was still there even though it was the wrong size for me.  She then noted how popular the J Brand had become and that she would more than likely stop carrying other brands to accommodate more space for those jeans, basically telling me that the price had gone up only because people liked the product, not through an error in original pricing.  
The whole experience was negative and left a bad taste in my mouth. I will not buy another item from this store during this pregnancy nor will I recommend it to other women. It is a shame for them since I was trying to support a local boutique and ended up getting burned for it. 
BTW, I have found almost all of the clothing that I bought at Belly through online sources for much better prices. Now that I know how brands fit me, I am shopping mostly online. 
So, I hope that it was worth the extra $60 to that saleslady for those jeans to offset the hundreds of dollars that I would have spent had I remained a loyal customer throughout my pregnancy and thereafter."
TkZIY6SZiT9bL6u5EXn2qA,zlf9A6EOSMsLPPi1k0VHiA,"Chuck and Sue, the owners, are truly great people, and they run an honest business.

Scottsdale Studios helped me put a pilot together for a show I've wanted to produce for a long time. They were honest, easy to work with, and genuinely good people. Even though shooting TV shows is not their core business, they took on this project for me and helped me to get my project done without having to spend too much money.

Scottsdale Studios' core business is renting out their studio, stage, and mixing equipment to local bands for practice, and to big-name bands who are preparing for concerts in Arizona. As I was working with Scottsdale Studios on my video, I believe they were also doing something with Jay Z - pretty cool.

If you're a musician looking for a place to practice, or to get some video of yourself on a stage, Scottsdale Studios is definitely the place to go. It's always nice doing business with great people.

A lady took her and asked me how much hair to cut. so I said up to about her chin is fine. she proceeds to cut just blunt and straight with no style at all.  I could have taken  pair of scissors and could have done that myself! when my sister came in she said, you should cut shorter and style it and the lady goes 'so you want me to do 2 haircuts?? you gonna pay for 2 haircuts??'  we were  both flabbergasted! i have never heard of such a thing. As a hairdresser, shouldn't you make sure your client is happy with your work? and if not, wouldn't you do anything you can to fix it??? (at least that has been my experience with other  hairdressers!) She wasn't quite done anyway and was only cutting for about 10 minutes! She could have fixed it if she was really a professional but insisted it would be considered 2 haircuts and we would have to pay double!! how ridiculous! the 'Boss' man was there but did not do anything to remedy the situation - she said 'the boss says the haircut is done'.. she then proceeds to say: next time.. to which of course we replied: NO - there will be NO next time.. 
she was trying to blame me because I told her to cut up to chin length but that was length, the style should have been up to her since she was the professional hairdresser! 
BEWARE of this place.. they do not do a good job and do not care about the customer..no wonder the place was empty! I should have clued in before the damage was done!
no Senior's discount available - $28.00 dollars down the drain for such a bad job!!!"

Dr. Bramley took the time to listen to all my concerns, weighed the pros and cons of treatment, and gave me helpful suggestions. He is clearly a vet who cares as much about pet owners as he does about pets (a quality I've found lacking at many other animal care facilities).

The waiting area and examining rooms are clean, and there are places to walk your pet outside while you wait. Prices for all services are much better than any other place I've been.

I mean, you can see how busy they are 24/7. This place has got to be a money maker. What's with the kid and her mom who sell candy every day just in front of the entrance to the store? Doesn't Circle K sell candy? Isn't this panhandling? Where's security? Why do the homeless, mentally ill, and the local meth heads feel so at ease to congregate here and bother customers? WHY is the soda fountain ALWAYS in disrepair?? WHY is the Debit/Credit option always down at the register? WHY during their busiest times is there only one cashier on duty?? Why are employees allowed to smoke outside in front of the store on their breaks??  WHY are the gas pumps so tagged up with gang graffiti that you can't see to use them?? How many complaints does this store need before they do something to make it better? I wish the Mexican grocery store across the street would get purchased by Quik Trip.

However, I stand by my review, as Urmston could not deliver on my original order and I am financially worse off from having used your online service.  Those are the facts.  I agree that Urmston has some good reviews but there are also some bad ones around (not including my own); I have looked.  Please note that the first unit was faulty AND discontinued (which is worrying at many levels).  The second unit was faulty.  Urmston Aquatics categorically stated to me in writing that they would not reimburse my P&P as per their Terms and Conditions.  Urmston Aquatics reimbursed the cost of the original order only because they could not provide a working unit (this was my second preference in my email to you).  Also, I understand that suppliers will not test any unit as this would invalidate the guarantee.  Finally, I did not ask you to abide by the Long Distance Selling Act, because I questioned whether this was a reasonable clause given the inconvenience and cost this was causing to me.  I do not take satisfaction in writing poor reviews.  Indeed, I rarely if ever write reviews.  This experience however warranted the effort."
uTqTY5KRC6sJHFbBGGc31w,uh13r0qMfogtrR6PzAd0Vg,"It's too bad even one star is an option. I was involved in a car accident when I was five months pregnant with my son and was referred to Dr. Tames by my midwife. I was a personal injury patient with her office which means that an insurance company would be responsible for my bills. Dr Tames office sent me a bill after I ""completed"" treatment (aka had my son). Months later as my attorney awaited her package to submit to the insurance company we received a new bill as well as my medical files. The new bill had increased charges of over $5000 as well as rewritten medical files. When I say rewritten, I mean literally rewritten by hand medical files. She claimed I complained of symptoms I never complained of and can be proven by my handwritten intake form I filled out when I first saw her. She made up 10+ visits to her office which I was never seen. She claimed that I received treatment that I did not (for example, several 60 minute massages, which not only never happened, she doesn't even do massage therapy). When I had my personal injury attorney confront Dr. Tames about the inaccuracies and request the correct billing and medical files she became hostile and informed me that there would be no negotiation on this account. I was not asking for a negotiation, I was simply requesting that I be charged for treatment that I actually received. I am not one to jump to conclusions but the only logical explanation I can come to as to why she would do this is because she knew an insurance company would be footing the bill and therefore was attempting to commit insurance fraud. I made it very clear that I would have no part in such and almost 2 years later I am still holding out on receiving any money from my insurance claim due to the fact that Dr. Tames has refused to send over accurate billing information. This is just a small portion of what occurred in my experience with Dr. Tames. Do yourself a favor and go see another chiropractor, I assure you that it won't be worth it to see her."

Our order came pretty quick. I ordered a coffee, latte, scone and fruit meringue. They were delicious.
The price was average too, just under ВЈ10 for 2 drinks, scone and meringue"

The staff are very knowledgeable and helped guide me through my purchases - both what i needed ,and where to invest ( which can sometimes be overwhelming for a first time mom). 

They gave me really personalized attention and called me back immediately with answers to any questions I had or modifications to my registry. They have an online store and registry which makes it easy to get organized. 

The staff went out of their way for me and they have definitely gained me as long term customer as my family grows. 
Highly recommended!!"

He came out, gave a fair quote (better than several others we got) and had a team there the following week. Carlos and Junior were the lead painters and did a great job spraying. They also caulked everything which was a big project. They finished by the end of that day. They stayed and fixed any imperfections we could find and Richard returned for a final walk through. We were very happy with it!"

pS881vYwCv0VM7bPqV7G6Q,x4g0aLq1BuoKk4Wtwwr-dg,"Deciding to do my last minute grocery shopping, and my last minute laundry on Christmas Eve was going somewhat smoothly for me. I planned and timed everything out. Knowing that stores and businesses would close early, I completed the washing of my three loads of laundry before 2pm, then headed out to two grocery stores. 

I completed my last minute shopping, and was back home after a few hours. Putting away my groceries, I was mindful of the time, and headed out to the Super Wash Coin Laundry on Noble Rd. 

When I arrived, the attendent was standing at the front door. He told me, and another young lady, that the Laundry Mat was closed (even though the sign on the window said it closed at 6:30pm on Christmas Eve, and the current time was just befor 5pm).

The other young lady explained that she just needed to dry her clothes, and so did I. My dryer has been broken for awhile now, and I had been a frequent customer of this Super Wash Coin Laundry. 

However, the attendant didn't care. He said the Laundry was closing and no one else could wash or dry anything else. When I asked him if he knew of another Laundry Mat, we could go to dry our clothes, he said to try the other Laundry Mat on Euclid--they should be open. 

When we were driving out of the parking lot, I noticed two other customers coming in, parking, then going in-- without being stopped at the door and turned around. 
I don't know it they were turned around later, but they seemed to go right in and put their clothes right in the dryers. That made me say: "" Hummmmmmmmmm.""

I arrived at the 2nd Super Wash Coin Laundry location (on Euclid Ave), shortly after 5pm. The sign on the door said it also was suppose to close at 6:30 pm on Christmas Eve. But the door was already locked. Another customer was outside with me, and she said people were inside, so maybe it was still open. 

We waited for a few moments and the attendant came to unlock the door, to let the customers out. He said that he was closed, even though the sign on the front window read that the store was still supposed to be open.

He rudely said that he didn't know why the other attendant told me to come there, and that he didn't get paid overtime. 

I understand that people want to get home and enjoy the Holidays with their friends and family members, but at the same time, I expect a company and its employees to honor their posted holiday hours. Therefore, going forward, I will take my business elsewhere."

I live in Thornhill, my boyfriend is from Newmarket. I only see Mike every other week. I took a photo of the roses and texted the pic to Mike. I told him to go back to the florist to show them what  my expensive roses look like. They said to him that he should bring them to the store so that they can see how I cut them. It would have cost me more on gas then what they would have done to conpensate. What a joke. Mike has bought flowers from them  for many years, but this will be the last. Flowers that I buy from the Superstore last longer than that. If you are going to buy from them, read this over again. THEY ARE EXPENSIVE AND VERY POOR QUALITY!!!!"

The pizza is delicious after a drink or five. 

The place didn't fix the back wall or the general greasy feeling but a repaint to a sky blue did go a small way towards freshening the place up. 

I tried the poutine on the recommendation of several yelp reviews and I have to say it was one of the worst poutines I have ever had. The gravy was salty enough but looked like it came from a can. The fries were limp and soggy with oil and there were about 10 curds on the whole thing. I will never order it again."

They clearly care for the pets they see because they are kind, and gentle and give treats to make sure it is not a negative experience for the pooches (or parents)

Dr. Spec was even willing to squeeze us in almost at closing time to see our little guy for an ear infection which was wonderful since we were going out of town and I didn't want him to be uncomfortable our whole vacation. He was great at showing us how to administer the medicine and making sure we did not feel rushed, although I am sure he wanted to leave. We love Fox Vets and their staff."

I hope this helps.

My honest review, everyone has different pallets, but there is no way this place should call themselves authentic!
Everything is out of a box and/or frozen, dethawed and placed in a mircrowave.
I grew up eating this food, my family is from Istanbul and this is a far cry from decent, it's barley eatable.
Doner is suppose to be cut thin, full of flavour and specific spices.
This was frozen, hard to chew and cuts of fat all over the place.
The owner should more honest with themselves, you would not eat this food at home, so why serve this uneatable food to paying customers.
Save yourself some money, go somewhere else.

Delightful design, quite a few of the rooms have their door within about 5 feet of the lovely indoor pool they have in this hotel. 

Only gripes - A/C was extremely loud, Wall Sockets were flimsy and my chargers keep falling out of them, and the lightbulb in my shower had no cover to protect from water... a little dangerous? 

Other than that it was a very pleasant hotel, continental breakfast was okay as well too. Good selection on it. Didn't get a chance to try the spa or thai restaurant (Big party was happening at the time so the lobby was crowded). Thankfully there were a large section of restaurants within walking distance and the C Train station was nearby also. The gym facilities were excellent as well too for being free. 

Definitely would consider staying there again if the need arises."

a6HjZnNVqUN6ftyL5GFavg,3xOmI-dTRb_34YXGWFGRFw,"I was ready to overlook the lukewarm salesman at this location, being that we were shopping for a difficult to find full size captain's bed and Oasis is one of the few furniture stores around offering a decent selection.  Lukewarm salesman aside, the bed was selected and delivered with setup, albeit without the handle hardware for the bed's cabinets.  Not a problem, since these would be sent to us by mail.  They were within a week, but they were the wrong ones.  So a call to Oasis' lukewarm salesman, now bordering on rude, made it clear we were on our own, and a phone number to the warehouse was provided.  The person at the warehouse said she'd research our issue and call back; and three weeks later still hadn't called so we placed another call to the warehouse and they told us that the door hardware wasn't the problem, the doors were the problem, and despite my insistence that the doors seemed fine, just the delivered hardware didn't fit.  No matter, they'd have to order new doors, and someone would be there by the next Wednesday to install them.  Next Wednesday came and went with no delivery of new doors, the next Wednesday they arrive to the house unannounced (I was gone, but they did wait to their credit)...with the same doors.  And NO handles.  And, said the installer, the doors were fine, which I had tried to explain to the Oasis warehouse.  So again, they'd have to be mailed to me.  And they were, just a few days later, and this time they fit, but they were mailed with insufficient postage and I had to pay it!  That's right, all that, and I had to pay postage to the mail carrier before they were delivered.  A fitting ending to a comedy of incompetence.  It's a great bed and our son loves it, but for this location, be prepared to pay a decent chunk of change for an indifferent sales staff, and a customer support staff who doesn't listen and can barely tell up from down."

They make bubble tea and yam fries with spicy mayo!

It gets pretty busy at lunch time since its downtown but they push customers through pretty fast.  The employees are really friendly and the prices are alright for the size of rolls they give you.

This centre was not my first (or second) choice but when it came time for my return to work, it was the only spot I could get.  My child has certainly bonded with some of the staff, but I have been disappointed on so many levels.  When it was bought by Edleun in November 2010 I had high hopes that a structure and systems would be put in place that would raise the professionalism of the centre; however, Edleun's two contributions seem to be in modifying forms and a more nutritional menu.  In fact, I think things have gotten worse.  The morale in the place is not great and the quality of staff and ensuring for consistent training and procedures appears to be no existent! After continual ""incidents"" that lead me to question this centre's practices. The Centre has now been rebranded as BrightPath and things continue to go down hill.  Staff are churning and the new Director had the audacity to say to me today (October 2013) that ""what happens at the daycare should stay at the daycare"" meaning parents should not talk to each other about issues within the centre. We are not getting feedback on our children's progress or clear communication on the operations of the centre.  The so called curriculum they promise seems to be haphazard at best.

These guys are old school, they fix broken lawn equipment and small engines, as well as stocking parts.  Forget the big box, they will NOT have what you need.  I like to fix my stuff rather than just replace it.  It saves space in landfills, its cheaper and older lawn stuff is much higher quality than the stuff you can buy built for todays ""throw away"" society.  

I recently aquired a year 2000 model John Deere walk behind lawn mower that had been sitting for a very long time.  I am pretty mechanically handy and found it needed a carburetor overhaul.  I called some other folks in the book and not only were thier parts more expensive than Bell Mower, but they did not stock them (a kit that fits at least 35% of all mowers made in the last 20 years) and also wanted to charge a $10 fee to get them (its not a special order item).  Called up Bell Mower and I told them what I needed, they said come get it- I didn't even bother to ask price and figured I would pay a premium because I needed it today.  It was cheaper than the other guys, only $2 more than online (don't forget to add shipping) and I got some great tips on installing the kit for FREE.  

Keep your money local and dole it out to deserving shops that provide real service for no extra charge!  Thanks Bell Mower!"

1) Late to open shop, kept waiting for 20-30 mins, and well 15 mins after my scheduled appointment with Senior Fade Master Luca.
2) Armen LIED about being at the same level as Luca, and that his work was perfect when his work was unfinished and my haircut was uneven.
3) Armen pushed me aside saying that he had no more time for me, shifting the blame for not having enough time to finish the haircut onto me as a customer.
4) Told by Junior Fade Master Armen that it was not Luca's work day, and that he wasn't even supposed to come in to work. 
5) Armen used shears that cut into my hair and scalp causing the back of my head to bleed. He fumbled twice with his shears and comb, with the latter having pressed against my eye.
6) I had to point out areas where he had missed including not cleaning the parting line with which Vileer and Luca had used for detailing.
7) Armen tried to cover his mistakes by trying hard to convince that I was in the wrong, that he didn't need to see me when we had a clear discussion about what I wanted before he began cutting.

I have been a loyal customer, seeing only your Senior Fade masters Luca and Vileer all this time, and paying for their great service and work plus gratuity where it was due. Today was a polar opposite of what I expected from you and your employees. Armen provided by far the worst experience, and was not only unprofessional but of poor character as noted above."

OYLyMqhl5kOkd57iJsSuiw,9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,"New location opened in the South Outlets a few weeks ago. It IS NOT an outlet store. 

First, Maurices is not my type of store. The designs are for a much younger crowd...junior high comes to mind. Second, I wasn't impressed with the quality of the items. Third, if a sale is going on everything is reasonable. Just know you'll have to replace everything sooner rather than later.  Fourth, the sizing is WAYYY off, from tags to actual fit. 

I'm not a fan of outlet stores, Ross, TJ Max or Nordstrom Rack. I hate cluttered stores, I hate not having room to walk about, I hate that everything is picked through. This store was cluttered (they have A LOT to choose from), was picked through (tshirts tossed about not folded; items on hangers backwards, not fully hung, messy), and there was little room to walk about. I felt like I was in one of those shops & not a regular store. 

So why was I here?  I was looking for inexpensive t-shirts & tops to get me through summer & didn't want to spend a fortune on disposable clothing.  I bought 8 items & my bill was $148: 2 drape neck tops, 2 kimonos, a cardigan, 3 necklaces. I really like everything I purchased. 

It's a large store. Everyone was very nice & helpful.  I shop primarily at Talbots, Ann Taylor & Loft (for disposable items) and the service is never at these shops, but it was at Maurices. If their styles & quality were what I was looking for I'd probably come here a lot. We'll see how the items hold up before I decide if I'll return or not.

I was impressed by how easy the rental agent made the application/paperwork and moving in process, as well as her great communication via email/phone. I consider myself lucky to have an apartment that is on the P16 and 67 bus route to downtown/Oakland, as well as a parking space in an underground garage. The security is also very good and I feel safe in the area. There is a roof deck that you can go on that has an amazing view of the city. 
But I think that one of the biggest assets of this property is the building superintendent. Any time that I have had a problem with something, he not only took care of it in a timely manner, but also made the necessary repairs to permanently resolve the issue. He is very detail oriented and just from the recent repairs in the building, as well as the repairs that he has done for my apartment, he adds a lot of value to this living community."
ebiLpBzkWSnwdoxHbXtfRw,7ssgTZtF7r8UbhlZ4czJUw,The only reason I am giving this store a two is because the assistant manager was very kind when I called but the cashier Tiana was very rude and did not know anything about the store policy. My total was $.99 and she proceeded to argue and tell me I had to make a minimum purchase of $5 and when I told her no it's only if I want cash back she had security escort me out. Never will I go to this store again if this employee is working. I plan on emailing corporate and letting them know about this specific employee as well!

Although it's a little on the pricey side, I love the bright colours and unique patterns.  No where else in the city offers such a rad selection of barely-theres.

pd7R3YVh0uJF0aVDD8AdGw,MSBoxbpiw2Sh2sPtts5i5A,"My husband and I have had the pleasure of working with Amanda for our ""save-the-date"" photo shoot and for our engagement session. We first met her at my friend's wedding where we got to see her in action! A true professional, she has a great eye and sense of beauty that enables her to capture the mood, character, and details that go into the perfect shot! 
She is warm and friendly which makes her easy to talk to and open up about the kind of ideas or vision you would have in mind. She's a master at capturing silhouettes, which I think is a signature of her photography and a personal favorite of mine. She also welcomes the client's creativity and ideas and can really take them to the next level.
I am extremely grateful to have worked with her on some of the most memorable occasions my husband and I had throughout this wedding process. She is the best at her craft and highly talented and skilled! I look forward to working with her again in the near future and cannot recommend Memories Though Time enough for your events!"

Vance was able to find me a mortgage with interest rate of 3.0% which is much better than I was expecting.  

Once I had found a home, Vance also kept me informed about what was happening with the finances at each step of the home buying process and would call to walk me through the paperwork with each new step in the process.

n5S6BuEvl96RgCTafnYkvg,_liiI__PpltIAGNBYOr0vw,"I was excited to try a new pizza place so close to my house.  I should have saved my money. Person on the phone and at the shop was very nice, so it's doubly disappointing to give them a bad review.

Bottom line, our pizza was over-cooked. We could tell when we opened the box.  The crust was dark brown, as was the cheese.  On one pizza the bottom of the crust was burned black and we could not eat it. The other was not as burned, but was so overcooked it was not enjoyable.  

Whoever cooked this pizza should have known the second it came out of the oven that it was ruined.  I would have preferred them being honest and asking me to wait an extra 10 minutes to make another instead of passing off something they had screwed up.  Sure they saved a little money that night, but they lost the lifetime value of me as a customer.  That hundreds of dollars lost as well as me not telling people to avoid going there.

It such a hassle to get home to discover the problem.  Do I call and complain? Do I have them make another requiring another trip and eating at 9:00 PM? 

We also ordered 6 buffalo wings which were good.  Good meat and tangy sauce.

Finally, I was also disappointed in the quantity of pizza toppings.  I ordered pepperoni and mushroom and there was maybe one mushroom per slice, some had none.

I really wanted to like this place, especially because I like thin crust pizza, but we are one and done. We won't be going back."

Months to get a stove as oven heated unevenly burners had bare wires. Tried sleeping garbage truck banged the huge commercial bin under our bedroom and we were on higher floors.  Even with window closed woke us up. Could hear elevator through closet since apt backed onto them.  They were always with one down or both.   Office told us to call elevator repair inside elevator as they are not responsible.  Fire bell going off once or more a month for long periods or malfunction.  Water shut offs every single month.

Could smell pot smoke cigarette smoke up from balconies below and would be sucked into our living room bedrooms also same up from other apts inside bathroom floor storage area inside apt. Through our hallway.  

Smelly stinky elevators and dirty... smelled either pot or urine. Do you really need to read more to stay far away?    Read other reviews especially the ""not recommended ones""  at the bottom. .. It's all true.  They rent to anyone. . move in move out nightmares.

LEL8Fgbs3escQuPkvrk-FQ,uEnnd5NuHAHHUZ7LljPk4A,"This couple who run S&C Tax, Sophie Phongsopha and Chris Heckler are out of business.  Why? Look at the many complaints but in my case they told me point blank my returns were sent in but were not.  Long story, was able to contact them and they promised to do but of course they did not do.  I now owe other states and the IRS thousands of dollars for improperly done tax returns

I doubt she will be in the tax business again.  Judging from the complaints here, she has failed many people. 

Also one year she said she had breast cancer and could not do my return but to send her my paperwork, well, I don't know who ended up doing them but whoever did not know what they were doing and consequently my IRS problems.  So, yea, she used the ""sickness"" excuse on me and when I asked her last year how she was,
she said, ""oh, I beat it (breast cancer)"".   Not too many 37 year old females ""beat"" breast cancer just like that.

Find someone competent and that is there all year round so you can ask questions.
I found it odd she would only answer the phone during the ""money"" season.  Well,
I paid a price for not being diligent."

As a musician, we practice and there is nothing worse than good work sounding horrible due to a lazy sound guy or crappy system.

ESG is neither. They truly care about the artist and making you sound better than you thought you would. Integrity is so hard to come by in this business and it was so refreshing to work with a group who really care about what they are doing and the people they are doing it for. 

They were early, stayed late and the equipment was top notch. Hire these guys and sound like a million bucks!"

Today I had to wait for 25 mins to do a 1 minute transaction (literally)...a card return. This was because the only cashier 'authorized' to work at the returns desk decided to take her break as soon as she saw me (the last person in a two-file line...) early on a Sunday morning. 

Tried getting help from at least two other staff members and finally a manager, who (when she finally stopped ignoring me and looked me in the face) in no uncertain terms asked me what I wanted her to do (maybe send another staff member to returns counter as hardly anyone else was in the store?!) and basically told me to just wait.

Avoid this store at all costs, would give a 0 if I could."

They have a very good variety of instruments and a pretty decent variety of accessories and amps. My only complaint is that they don't have much in the way of sheet music/song books. If you're looking to pick up a guitar or bass I strongly recommend checking out Corson!"
hL6imrnIayfMrtNXCfolJA,NitKvmu2o7370owSklSKaw,"So disgusted with this store. The lady who works in front (Christina)has a very bad attitude. I really miss the lady from before... It never ceases to amaze me how people only have a problem when something directly happens to them. There were Black customers being harassed in the store by a racist and instead of addressing the situation she brushed it off. It was brought to her attention and also the Manager's attention. She was in the store as it happened but the excuse was that she was so busy she didn't hear the racist remarks...so it wasn't her problem. She's a Black woman herself yet she didn't seem to understand or believe why the customers were upset about the racist, disparaging comments the man made in the store about Black people. 

The Manager made up excuse after excuse for her lack of action and deflected the situation onto the customers getting upset. I believe she just wanted to ignore the situation and only became upset when the other customers were upset by her lack of action. 

I myself was shushed, told to be quiet and treated rudely when I asked about the situation without yelling. After speaking with the Manager it didn't really matter in the end. Just a waste of energy. 

Both of them are in denial about the poorly handled situation. Christina's rude, defensive, nonchalant attitude about the situation was disgusting.The Manager had no problem with it. He's an enabler with a poorly trained employee. The situation could have easily been diffused by telling the man to be quiet or leave just like the Manager said to me when I was simply trying to find out what happened. 

If you fail to address customers being racially harassed and disparaged in your store don't be surprised when people get upset by your lack of care and you loose business. No one should disrespect anyone in the store including you. After over 8 years of going to this store I know to  take my business elsewhere. Just like you expect to be respected so do your customers."

I frequented their Ahwatukee location for a majority of this time and was treated with utmost kindness from John Pitt every time I came in.  John always made sure I got what I needed, and if they didn't have it, he made sure I got it within a very reasonable time!  I was really sad when they closed down the Ahwatukee store this past year.  I recently moved to the Chandler area and needed a  new waterbed mattress.  To my surprise, not only was there a store right around the corner from my new home, but also there was John Pitt  eager to help with my needs again!!  At first I needed a pump to empty my waterbed to move. I couldn't get it to work and brought it back in to their store.   It was broke.  John fixed it  right on the spot and let me keep it for an extra day, at no additional charge, for my inconvenience.  Once I was ready to buy my mattress and liner, he made sure it was in stock.  He even waited after hours for me to pick it up, when I was stuck in traffic. He even offered to load it in my vehicle for me.   I recently found out that John has been with Oasis for the past 27 years!!  That is truly commendable if you ask me.  John is a huge asset to Oasis and I hope that he is there for many years to come.

I've booked the car rental with them for three days, when I came in an hour earlier than expected time the person at the front desk was really rude and unprofessional telling me that '' we have no cars, come at scheduled time''. I asked politely one more time that I can see 5 SUV cars on the lot. Finally, the process started. 

The guy tried to tell me the insurance is mandatory and that my credit card will no cover it, they have a printout of some kind that is stating this information. SCAM, I travel for work and know how the process works. I requested an extra day that they said would cost me double my original rate; that is fine. I've asked the guy if  I can leave my car here for the rental period, he said no but for 20 CASH agreed to keep it on the lot. 

Interesting part begins when you return the car, they will charge you for additional mileage(millage was UNLIMITED in the booking confirmation), the 5-7 list of other fees.  So i was expecting the bill to be around 60 CAD and received a 600 CAD bill, I am disputing this with AMEX

AVOID AT ALL COST!!!!!!!"

Why they would schedule such an appointment when the part was not even in stock? Beyond me. They called me another 2 months later to schedule the appointment to replace the fuel tank which would take at least half a day. I was told by the lady who called that I should drop my car off on Thursday by 6:30pm and there will be a rental here for me (she was going to note it on my file) and the rental company closes at 7pm. This way I can still go to work on Friday. I did exactly that. When I arrived at 6:30pm on Thursday, they were more than happy to take my keys and then asked if I need a ride somewhere. I let the gentleman know that there should be a rental for me. He called around and told me to wait as the guy from the rental company is coming from about 20 minutes away. I figured - with my car. To my surprise, the guy from the rental company picked me up to drive me to the rental company where I can get a car. This wasn't explained beforehand, and was time consuming but I was ok with it as I believe this is the process. However, when I arrived at the rental company (35 minutes away from my house), minutes before 7pm, he had no car for me...I was told as Ford did not let them know to have a car ready for me, he did not bring one over from their other locations. I had to wait another 30 minutes until a car arrived for me and I could finally get on the road. A process of dropping off my car for a mistake Ford made, should not have taken me over 2 hours. I was pissed, but got over it. It happens... the next day I got a call at 2:30pm asking me to pick up my car by 5pm (I was previously told I had till 7pm to pick up). I rushed over after work ready to pick up my car so I can get home to my toddler who is waiting on me and yet again, Ford disappoints. THEY LOST MY KEYS. The entire staff in the service department walked around like chickens with their heads cut off looking for my keys that they swear were attached to my work order. It's nearing 5pm and the gentleman (I think Frank) who looks like the manager decides well, his day is over and he needs to get home. He suggests I drive home with my rental, pick up my spare keys, drive back to the dealership, drop the rental keys in the overnight bin and fill out all the appropriate paperwork, and then drive home my car. And then on MONDAY, I can call the guy who I dealt with when I dropped it off to see what he can do. It was Friday. So I asked him if no one will be looking for my keys on Saturday?? He was a little arrogant and said he's looking for a solution to get me on the road tonight. So I'm supposed to rest easy all weekend when someone who works at Ford, who knows my address, has my keys?! I stood around for over 30 minutes as they searched, fuming at this point. Finally they discover a sales man took off with my keys and went on a test drive (he moved my car). I'm assuming this is not policy! So 45 minutes later, I'm finally on my way with my car. They didn't even have the common decency to pull my car to the front. I had to walk around to the back of the building to get it myself. There was a lady who showed remorse and stated she will ask the manager to call me as this was not a great experience for me etc. I let her know I will never be coming back to Planet Ford again - I didn't even want to this time but I had no choice as Ford had a recall. It's been over a week, and guess what - no call yet! I guess since I told her I wasn't come back, the manager didn't waste his time calling. The service was appalling. I can't believe this sub-standard service is what passes for the norm these days. I do not recommend Planet Ford to anyone who is looking for service without added stress!"
apuq9eTHlFE1etrdND0R3g,PhzWjKSc6ntvF1i-3OYRpg,"This place is very shady, I stopped in there with my fiancГ©e to take a look aroud and while there were a few items that caught her eye she eventually settled on a shirt. The odd thing was there are no price tags on anything and after glancing  around I saw a few signs that had prices in the 19.99 dollar range so I assumed that things were very reasonably priced. Once we decided to get the shirt we were promptly directed to the rear counter and within a few seconds the transaction was done but we were not happy with the price and after an argument and every excuse in the book, we got no where with the fact that we did not want to purcahse the item. Anyway I had to eat the 65 dolllar purchase and leave displeased with the service. I would never purchase anything in this store again as there is no one in the store capable of handling customer service. Every employee had the same line that the manager was the only one able to do anything  and it was just our luck that we just missed him and he wouldn't be back until tomorrow. To me it is just a very shady operation and I was not pleased with the fact that there is a no refund policy even if we never left the counter."

I dealt with Evan, who was professional and easy to work with. They gave me a window of 9-10 AM to show up, and they arrived at 9:30. They charge a three hour minimum and my entire move took 3 hours and 15 minutes- Evan was kind of enough to only charge me for 3. They were very respectful of my items, even suggesting that I should take a few fragile items (mirrors, lamps) in my car as their safety was at risk in the truck. They moved quickly and didn't ""milk the clock"" as I fear some movers may do. Overall, a very positive 5-star experience. I will happily recommend Evan and company to my friends and family!"

I'd planned on renting a car at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport but was put off by the excessive charges. Instead, next day I hired a car from Enterprise in E Via de Ventura and was very pleased with the service they gave us. 

When I rang later to extend the hire for another 12 days they said no problem. When I returned it, they made a quick inspection and found all to be in order. They explained the bill to me, then gave us a lift back to our apartment. 

I was happy that there was no sales pitch to get me to upgrade. I did hire a GPS but that was at my instigation. They added my wife as a second driver at no additional charge. 

Next time I'm in Scottsdale I shall certainly hire a car from them again."

833FaNxWNM_IZanawr1nFQ,SoDcT9Wy5YWC53cKFQk_bg,"My first impression of Loi Nam is very poor. It looks so rundown. It is nothing compared with Leelee or Mekong. But I give Loi Nam 5 stars for its homemade food. I could have given 10 stars if it was an option.

Born and raised in Vietnam for 18 years, I know how Vietnamese cuisine should be.  Their Hue-style rice noodle, BГєn BГІ Hu, is exceptionally good. It was such a surprise to me. Many Vietnamese restaurants in Phoenix area managed to get the beef noddle soup, Ph, to a nice level but the rest of the menu were just wrong. Loi Name's Hue-style rice noodle is not only over the top delicious, it also comes in a very generous portion. $5 for a takeout that fills up a huge bowl. Nobody can beat that.

Steam buns, BГЎnh Bao, are to die for. The flour is moist, sweet, soft. The meat is just right.

Vietnamese specialty dessert, mung-bean ball (sorry don't really know the real English name), chГЁ TrГґi Nc, gave me a jaw-dropping experience. Huge ball of soft, chewy flour, with mashed mung-bean inside in sweet ginger flavored sauce. Served with coconut milk. Never ever I had chГЁ TrГґi Nc this good in the U.S. (and I tried almost everything in Little Saigon, CA).

Very difficult Ph to make, chicken noodle soup, comes with eggs (trng gГ  non). Real Vietnamese chick noodle soup would not miss these special type of eggs.

Loi Nam's food draw me to their store again and again. Not only they know how to cook real Vietnamese food, they choose to do it correctly, with focus on detail. They wouldn't skip any ingredient.

However, there is a hassle to get to these good food. The owner, ch By,  doesn't cook the same food everyday. I have to call in to make an order for the next day pickup. I asked her why she doesn't make the food more available. She said she only makes the food fresh and sell within a day. The next day, some food won't remain the same quality she would like (like chГЁ TrГґi Nc if refrigerated the flour would get hard and must be microwaved before eating, hence reduce taste). 

It is best to call when you're nearby and ask what she has for the day. If you're lucky you'll get some real specialty food."

this eye doctor was the worst experience I've ever had.

This is supposed to be a walk-in, that means the doctor should be there all day, but he's not ever there, he's only there when somebody makes a scheduled accurate appointment

The eye exam was awful, he took literally five minutes on  checking my eyes, the prescription was wrong and that made the lenses wrong for my glasses , a big mess.

This doctor just doesn't spend the correct amount  of time, or use the correct equipment, I felt so nervous because I can tell he was in a big rush to get out of there , when I showed up he was not there, I had to wait 20 minutes, and then I saw him come in get out of his car in the parking
Lot, it look like he just woke up..

and I learned the hard way by going to him, he tells me he's been there 15 years and everybody's happy, I really doubt that, very bad experience with this man.

Please do yourself a favor, spend more than $60 and go to a better eye doctor."

Beyond the beat down appearance and rough exterior lies an Asian grocery store that can satisfy your basic needs for Asian cooking.  The owners are great and very friendly and you can count on good suggestions and even a little cultural history on Vietnamese cuisine.  Aside from the groceries that are present with your can goods, spices, fresh Asian vegetables, and your selection of meats and seafood, what should draw you in is the small display of cooked and prepared foods in the back.  When ready and fresh are delicious and convenient to buy and take home to eat for dinner which will save you the time to prepare these Vietnamese dishes.  For me the hidden gem of Phoenix and Arizona is there Banh Bao.  This is a steamed Asian pastry filled with barbeque and steam pork with quarter of a hard boiled egg.  When eaten fresh out of the oven, the ingredients melt in your mouth combining the sweetness of the dough mixed with the savoriness of the pork meat.  I only wish this was made daily."

But, then, I tasted the ice cream.  It was delicious!  I guess flash freezing allows for fewer ingredients and super fresh ice cream.  My friend had the toasted marshmallow flavour.  The marshmallows are torched right there in front of you and mixed into the ice cream (fat content of your choosing).  I had one shot of espresso mixed in with 12% (?) milk fat cream.  Sooooooo tasty."
zhKTy6XLKkConDapIN11KA,JznLsfEePu9zw5Ano8qLnw,"I am reviewing Lori Walters specifically and her lack of professionalism in dealing with senior citizen tenants. Ms. Walters is non-responsive and never returns calls. My parents, both of whom are in their 80's, rent a 2 bedroom house on Legend Dr. Their lease is up for renewal. Despite repeated attempts to have the refrigerator and dishwasher repaired or replaced, 
Ms. Walters, representing the property owner, Mr. Philip Donovan, has chosen to ignore my parents' entreaties. Instead the rent will be increased by $100/month in January 2017. My parents have chosen to renew for another year because the thought of moving at their age is out of the question. I hope by posting this review I can prevent potential clients from doing business with Ms. Walters, which undoubtedly, they will ultimately regret."

xPhez4YuKRkVFDb77hIVvA,YZmvHyWZ3AJy_Qv1uUPGuQ,"I got my hair colored here yesterday and I am so impressed with how amazing it looks!  Tanya did such an incredible job on my high-lights, it really exceeded my expectations.  Until now the only choices for a decent hair salon in Oakville were the places on Lakeshore, which are overpriced, no free parking, and tons of attitude.  Backstage Hair Salon was a great find, I just saw it when I was going to the nail salon a few doors down.

The price for the hi-lites and blowdry was $175, an incredible value.  It was basically a corrective color treatment because my hair was so messed up to begin with.  Tanya lightened without using bleach, she was really attentive to what I needed done.  I had NO breakage after the blowdry - the robe they gave me was black, and I was looking for any telltale blonde hair shedding as she dried it, but nope, not a single broken hair on my head.

This salon has never been busy, probably because its so new.  It's easy to get an appointment and there is a friendly atmosphere.  I'm just really suprised and happy with how amazing my hair looks, and after 5 years in Oakville I finally found a hairdresser who does a great job without charging a fortune.  Thank you Backstage Hair Salon, see you soon."

1jmJ6wwlIsMozIx5_ld-3Q,B8i7nb14szGwi212Y2LI-A,"Dave Heck is one of those people who has a connection with, an affinity for and an obvious love of dogs.  The training methods of the Sit Means Sit program, and Dave in particular, are excellent.  I was adopted by Missy--a 6 year-old boxer mix--at The Animal Foundation on Mojave here in Las Vegas in early November of 2013.  Very shortly thereafter, I began looking for some training for her--since I am a disabled veteran and needed help to be able to provide her with understanding of a basic set of commands so that I could give her the kind of life she needs, and provide me with the control to be able to do that.
 
Most especially, I wanted to be able to take her to dog parks, or similar environments, to get her the exercise she so obviously needs, while knowing that when I want her to ""come"" back to me, or ""heel"" when we're walking together, I would know that she would do so.  While we're not completely to that point yet, we are definitely making measurable progress!  Dave's willingness to go ""above and beyond"" to provide a dog's ""partner"" with the tools he or she needs to have confidence in that dog's obedience is truly remarkable!  He has been a tremendous help to me, and for that I thank him!
 
I would strongly recommend both the Sit Means Sit training, and Dave Heck, in particular, to any dog owner who wants to develop a great relationship with his or her ""partner,"" and the confidence that the training method, and the trainer, will work for you!"

zDSejUl8clMFWQXXCXbnPg,DYc2q9XfFZcdJ0QYvRrlbQ,"This review based on a few experiences with Fada.

1.   They showed me how to fix my own mirrors.  Cost = ZERO $.
2.   Did a safety check of my tires to ensure things were safe, secure and properly installed.   Cost = ZERO $.

Based on this, I took my bike in for a tire change.   Drop it off Monday he says.   I expected a couple of days, but it was ready in just a few hours, at a cost much less than the traditional ""vespa"" dealerships whos prices are WAY higher.

I had previously taken my scoot into another dealer whos name I would not mention, and they had given me ""advice"" about changing both tires, with expensive PIRELLI brands, whos lifespan is sketchy at best.    I ride over 50 km per day for work, and at that rate, I'd have needed to replace the Pirellis by the end of the season again.

At Fada,  I only required one tire to be changed (the back never lasts as long as the front), and I got a top notch Michelin.   Including Labour, i paid roughly the same as the sticker price of the Pirelli ONLY from the other guys.

New tire, scoot running sound, and my wallet isn't nearly as empty as it could be.

Third time took my engagement ring to be polished, had to be sent away because it's platinum so it takes a week again. I was a little disappointed this time the polishing wasn't as nice as it was on my wedding band.

WZIKjz9Pq50xOZUBfAebhw,QlM3L-BbyELBOUg4cFEsWw,"The food is Burger King food. I don't have high expectations regarding quality. I do however expect that customer service will be at least up to par with other fat food joints. 

This morning, i pulled in to grab a quick sandwich before a long day of meetings. After the car in front of me got done ordering, i pulled up to the menu, and was greeted in the normal fashion. Provided my order and got a ""thank you"". No total. No instructions to pull forward. So I pulled forward. Then the wait started....3 minutes......5 minutes....*shuts off engine*.....7 minutes before the person in front of me was presented with their order.....then more waiting, as the car and the girl in the window carry on a conversation lasting approximately 2 minutes.

When I finally got to the window. The employee asks ""What did you want on that again?"". I was a little taken back and said ""So, my order has not been put in yet?"". She snapped at me in a very matter-of-fact tone ""NO"".  Had she seemed even remotely understanding i would have just placed my order at the window. Instead I placed my money back into my pocket and began to pull away. At which point I received a very sarcastic ""Byeeeeee"".

For the Owners/Manager/Operators: There is very little that distinguishes your food from the other fast-food joints. I don't go because it's better. I go because it's convenient to where I am at any given time. I will, however, give my business to locations that provide stellar customer service. If you aren't communicating the need for customer service to your employees, you are failing. If your employees are not providing at LEAST a minimum of proper customer service, then they are failing you, and your bottom line. 

I won't be going back to this location any longer for food, drinks, or the occasional shake anymore."

Too much shade, not enough drainage, and lots of dog/foot traffic made it impossible to keep grass alive.  After researching what was available in my area, I went to see the products in person and price out the choices.  ForeverLawn without a doubt has the best product and very competitive pricing.  I had them install 1400 sq ft of turf, and couldn't be happier with the results.  Both Chris and Crystal were a pleasure to work with, and my backyard not only looks real, but it holds up well to both heavy rain, and my kids and dog playing on it.  If anyone is at all struggling with the decision, I think ForeverLawn is your best choice and it's well worth the money.  I'd highly recommend working with them, you will definitely be pleased."

J3w2hLfV55bswBeQYFg7Og,k0cZMJZFVdVpx89C8ldCzg,"Leafers Landscaping took my money and left the job half done.  I paid Leafers Landscaping $1730 for a yard clean up front and back, weed spraying, trim a couple trees, and laying 200 square feet of pavers to extend my patio.  The owner, Juan, started out as a stand up guy but that went downhill soon after he had ""phone problems"".  

The job was not completed by the deadline.  When asked what he was going to do to make it right, Juan stated he would take $100 off the cost when the job is complete.  The missed deadline was due to his crew walking off the job with no notification.  This resulted in poor prep work for the pavers which extended the job. 

The pavers were laid over the course of the next week. They look good, I will admit.  But Juan was supposed to return two days later to resand the gaps and seal the seams.  On the 4th day, I texted him asking when he was going to finish my patio.  Nothing.  A week after that, I texted him stating that I guess I would have to show up at his house to settle this agreement.  He showed up at my house that day stating that I misunderstood the agreement.  Giving him the benefit of the doubt, I asked what he was going to do to make this right.  He said he could show up in a two days to finish the pavers and respray the yard, as I already have weeds growing (his spraying came with a 6 month guarantee and I have lots of weeds 3 weeks later). When I asked for another $50 off the cost of sealing the pavers for my troubles, Juan said that I have been trying to lowball him at every turn.  It was his quote, it was his idea to return $100 for blowing the original agreement yet I am trying to lowball him.

Here it is 4 days later with no call, no show.  My wife and I ended up finishing the pavers and moved all the excavated dirt to the side of the house ourselves.  Half way through, I decided to take some pictures to show how he and his crew left my yard.  Trash everywhere, tree not trimmed, excavated dirt and stones left in my yard.  I still have to pick up his trash, seal my pavers, get the excavated dirt off my property, and re-spray my yard front and back.

Do not trust this company. Just another layman thinking he has what it takes to run a business.  Once he figured out he was losing money because of his poor and uneducated quote, he left me high and dry. He still owes me $100. I even told him in the beginning that if this job went smoothly, I was going to spend more money (by his quote, another $5000 or so) with his company.  Total amateur hour!  Stay away."

Other than that the experience would have been a zero. I asked to have my transmission fluid checked have filled. Instead a diagnostic was ran on my car, and the transmission fluid wasn't even checked. I had to call back twice, once to get someone to check my transmission fluid and again for someone to actually do something about it. Then no one even called to tell me if putting in the transmission fluid (2 quarts) fixed the problem. Filling the car with transmission fluid made my problem go away, but the service provider failed to tell me why my transmission is burning off fluid. I was just told it needs to be replaced, which comes off like a lazy money grab rather than actual assistance.I was then charged for the diagnostic I didn't ask for, and was talked down to as if I was done a favor. I asked to see what was the cost of replacing the transmission fluid. Instead of answering the question, I was just told time and time again how I got a good deal, but I have nothing to compare my ""deal"" to because at no point was anyone able to show me a price or estimate for refilling transmission fluid. Finally, the dealership had my car all day while I was at work, but no one bothered to wash it until I returned to the dealership 8 hours later, even though the work was done hours before my return. So it was hastily washed and done very poorly. There was soap residue and smudges all over the car. I had to take the car for a wash right after leaving the dealership."

RBEFjztls6xArCPUwX3EWA,ZkTPIKI2X8a0nB-UVwR20A,"We absolutely love and are thrilled with our new shower.  When looking for the perfect shower walls, I was very excited to find the Forzastone travertine shower panels.  And when Forzastone added DIY kits, that sealed our decision to go forward with the project.  The panels are affordable, groutless, and a light-weight real stone alternative to using full stone, and, with proper sealing, they are low maintenance and water-proof.  As infrequent DIY'ers ourselves, the DIY kit is not beyond those with limited home improvement experience.  Our customer service experience with Jodi, David, and Michelle has been exceptional.  They have been super, always willing to lend advice and technical support along the way.  If you are thinking of remodeling your bathroom, or you want to get rid of the problems dealing with grout, Forzastone panels should be at the top of your list of products.  And if you're not partial to travertine, Forzastone panels (and optional accessories) also come in marble and quartz, and there is a variety of colors available to suit your personal taste."

Each and every time we have worked with him, we have always been happy. There are two things that set Brandon apart from other realtors -- his communication skills and his integrity. Brandon always responds quickly and communicates thoroughly. You never feel confused or uncertain when you are working with Brandon, because of his consistent and detailed communication. As for his integrity, it is second to none. Where other realtors would just try to get the deal done, Brandon fights for every penny for you and is a true advocate for what you want. This right here is the primary reason why we will always continue to work with him. He is a young, smart, creative problem-solver and go-getter. He is also very experienced in working with short sales and foreclosures, which many of the more old school realtors are less accustomed to. We are happy to have him as our realtor and have recommended him to others as well."

I purchased a massage table last week from Brody massage and was told at the time of purchase that the tables have a thirty day return with receipt. I was also told their printer was down as it was their last day at the cave creek location, and that they would send me a receipt the next day via email. 

I never received a receipt. I called and asked for it again, and they said they sent it. I never received it. The table is very cheaply constructed and sways and wobbles and the adjustable legs slid down during a massage. 

I call today to return the table and had the intense misfortune of speaking with two ""managers"". One female, one male. Both refused to give me their names. I was then told that they sent the receipt twice and they would not be sending it again and that the table was defective? Well, tough. Because all sales are final ( um, 30 days? Hello?)  I was then yelled at by the manager and head of warehousing and told I just had buyer's remorse and that I was just wanting to voice my frustration and not listen. Okay, yes. At this point I very much regretted buying this terrible table from this disreputable company who won't give me a receipt. I was told, when I asked for the 5th time  to be sent a physical receipt, that they would not be doing that because I clearly already had the receipt and what do I even need it for?

I was hung up on, called lazy, disorganized, flaky and stupid. I was told I could come pick up a receipt, and when I asked for the address, was refused. I asked for the owner's name and was told Brody Massage, LLC. 

Stellar, all the way around. Now I'm stuck with a paperweight of a table and no way to write it off on my taxes because they won't even give me a receipt. Awesome.

Oh, and by the way, manager of the warehouse? The owner of your company is Scott  Brody. So, nice job refusing simple information that I was able to pull up on the Internet."

First, underground parking is not connected to the building.
Second, there are doors to the outside on the main floor, but you can't use them. 

Third, there really isn't any room service, but the thai restaurant on location is pretty darn good. (They supposedly just prepare all the burgers in advance, so you can't get a burger without a bun! He recommended the Thai Food because it was fresh - he was right, it was good). 

Fourth, front desk staff are slightly terse, but efficient.

Condition of the suite: 
Supposedly went smoke free a year ago, but smelled of smoke still, so luckily I could open the ""Emergency Exit Only Alarmed"" door in my room, because (guess what) the door wasn't alarmed!

Water-damaged roof tiles in bathroom, bathtub is grotty. 

BUT, overall, the space is weirdly satisfying. The room wasn't big, but had a king-sized bed (the AAA discounted rate). The room I had wasn't facing the pool, so was relatively quiet.

hxWqksXGHiwz2qINMb7FVQ,PfjVFuSN0Jet_gq3pdDWnQ,"After having just moved out of one of BMI's apartments in Champaign, I can safely say I'd never rent from them again.  

The one and only reason this company has any positive reputation is because of their maintenance guy, Gary.  Stand up guy who works hard to keep tenants happy.  

I'd recommend renting from BMI if you:

1) Don't mind being pressured into signing a lease for the following year after having just moved into your new place.  If you don't sign a new lease within 5 weeks of just moving in, they start showing your apartment for the following year.  This is an especially nice feature when it's never mentioned prior to signing on with them in the first place.

2) Leave your apartment cleaner than when you moved in and don't mind paying them $75 for it.  I just got part of my security deposit back from them today.  I was charged $35 for ""minor dusting and window cleaning in the entire apartment.""  I thought this was a bit odd because I had to clean those very things when I moved in.

I was charged another $40 for ""1hrs touchup paint in bedroom and living room.""  To my knowledge, most apartments are supposed to be repainted when a new tenant moves in unless they request otherwise.  I spackled the few small holes in the walls from hanging pictures and sanded them down.  

With the many other choices in this town, there's no reason to go through this company.  

I'd give less than 1 star if it was an option."

The decor is cheap, the fluorescent lighting makes you feel like you're sitting at the DMV, and the evening techno ballads from the adjacent martial arts shop mixed with the restaurant's Bollywood music makes you wonder if you're in Gilbert or an after-hours club in Mumbai (I guess Islamabad would be more fitting in this case).

I arrived about 20 minutes until closing and was quite grateful that the restaurant owner invited me to come in and have a seat.  Since it's Ramadan, I tried out the evening buffet which was a bit small but still had about 6 or 7 meat and veggie dishes.  Honestly, I can't remember the names of all the dishes but all I can say is they were good, but oh so freakin' spicy!  I'm a glutton for punishment when it comes to spicy food, but several of the dishes carried such a kick that I was reminded of the time one of the cooks at Cyclo went nuclear on my Pad Thai!  Thankfully, there was enough mango lassie and buttery naan to keep me from weeping profusely and throwing in the towel.

I would recommend Aromas if you're looking for a break from the norm.  The menu offers Halal and Vegetarian entrГ©es at an affordable price, and the service was good.  The decor has much to be desired, but I usually give tasty food a priority over accommodations.  ;)"

Week 2 I had done some research and asked them to check for Pyloric Stenosis as her father had this when he was born and needed an operation at a month and a half to correct it. I read that children are more likely to have this if one of the parents did. The doctor showed complete disregard for what i had requested and said she's fine, just change her formula.

Week 3 her projectile vomiting had become worse, it it was difficult for her to push out stool and showed blood in her stool. Again i requested they check for Pyloric Stenosis. To amuse me the doctor pushed on her tummy a little bit and said she's fine. He stated that i was feeding her too much and to starve her for 8 hours then begin feeding her a lesser amount than I had prior to that and change her formula AGAIN. I advised him that i read on line they normally check by an ultra sound. He said it wasn't necessary and to continue with the change of formula as planned.

Last Sunday she had thrown up each time i fed her, fed up and frantic I took her to the ER. First thing they did was an ultra sound. Sure enough she was positive for PYLORIC STENOSIS. She was severely dehydrated due to the continuous vomiting and was placed on an IV for a full day before they operated on her. We were just released from the hospital today.

Needless to say I will never return to any of their locations. I understand they thought maybe she had an allergy (even without testing her stool) which i had requested as well. But when i give you all the facts and request an ultra sound because I'm almost positive I knew what the issue was and it goes ignored to the point of her being hospitalized. Completely unacceptable."

Taylor took the time to know what my taste was and did not waste my time on homes that didn't meet my requirements.  He found me the perfect home in a great area.

I truly would recommend Taylor to anyone looking for homes in the Scottsdale area."

The director is one of the most patient people you would ever meet. He listens through all your ideas and gives his ""2 cents"" adding a lot of creative input to any project. His professionalism (without the Hollywood attitude) certainly comes through. We are about to work on a tenth project with Urban Truth. 

When you work with Urban Truth you can be rest assured that you get not only the best results but dedication and painstaking detail from conceptualization to delivery. Urban Truth is a partner and a trusted solutions giver and I recommend them as the number 1 provider of video and film solutions on your next project."

I have been meaning to do this review since beginning of December

I have taken Family pictures for the holidays before. 
I have usually gone to picture people. 
This 2016 family Christmas photos I found a good deal on Groupon and tried JCPenney portraits. 
Let me tell you!!! 
I was so impressed with the experience. 
Scheduling the appointment was easy, they sent me a courtesy reminder via email and a courtesy follow-up call confirming my appointment.
Checking in was easy We didn't have to wait long, but the real reason for writing this review is to talk about my photographer Cat. 
Cat was so amazing! 
There was 7 of us. Myself, my husband, 4 kids and a baby. 
She knew how to position us every way possible and knew exactly how to get everyone to smile. 
She really took the time with us. She was also delightfully professional! I couldn't thank her enough. 
The photos came out perfect! I even ordered extra.
After the session about a week or so later I was able to pick up my order and they emailed me my photo session so I can go back and place more order for extra photos or gifts. 
I enjoyed the entire experience with them. 
I would definitely recommend them."

We walked out with 6 new dining room chairs, a gorgeous artisan glass bowl for the center of the table, and stools for our breakfast bar and wet bar in the rec room. The selection is phenomenal and the prices are some of the best in the city for high end modern furniture - and they'll negiotiate if you buy volume.

I had no idea this little day spa was tucked into the shopping center on the corner of Scottsdale and Pinnacle Peak.  What originally drew me in was an AZSpaGirls deal for an ""Angelic Glow facial"" with microderm, brow shaping and eye and lip treatment for $59. When I called to book I also found out they were offering spray tanning for $19. YES!  Its cold outside here in AZ and I was desperately in need of some color.

The reception area is small but inviting and the lady at the desk was very friendly.  She gave me a packet of specials and a $10 off card to come back again for another service.  What a great surprise!  The 50 minute facial was relaxing.  I was with Jenel and she had me get into a pod which is something I have never done for a facial before.  However it was warm and relaxing (and about 20 minutes in the pod is equivalent to 2 hours of sleep!).  The facial itself was great.  Jenel even gave a scalp and neck massage at the end.  Afterwards I tried the spray tanning.  I have never used the FakeBake spray tan solution but so far so good.  We will see what it looks like after I finally get to shower in 6-8 hours.

I think The Beauty Scene is a great little hidden gem in far North Scottsdale and their specials are fantastic!"
FmQNlDzO9QoKQzedomQNJw,dhMWX-4c0FIRiJkVn8VxYQ,"There's a reason this business has not 'claimed' their company on Yelp. I usually take the time to boost up businesses with Yelp reviews, and I don't often encounter such poor quality that I'd post a very negative review, however this business deserves to treat the community that ""keeps it in business"" much better. Truecare also performs commercial business landscaping; the owners should turn away new/ residential customers and focus on the usual hacking of trees and mowing of lawns that don't require the type care a home requires.

Initially found Truecare via Groupon and we had no complains after the first visit; Scott responded to our e-mail; we met and spoke with him on the day of work, as well as his other employees. We have a typical residential house & yard (small grass space in front & back, rock landscaping, a few bushes and flowers). Our landscaping initially only needed very minor, general maintenance (especially since we mow the lawn ourselves), so there was nothing of note after the first visit. We've used this company a few additional times and it is clear they are not ""professional"" and do not take care in their work for their customers. Requests we've made for specific care (i.e.. ""please cut back the bush in the corner of the yard that has grown through the fence"") are ignored; debris under overgrown bushes and plants are not removed; bushes/ trees are not pruned - for example. 

SCOTT AND KERI please turn away residential customers and focus on commercial business landscaping. Residential homeowners work hard for their money. If we are requesting home landscaping, we do not have the time or expertise to care for it ourselves. Help your local community keep their neighborhoods and homes cared for properly, and stop wasting our time and money."

Krystyna was our dance teacher and she was amazing. We were pretty indecisive about our ""first dance"" song so she suggested that we learn swing. Particularly since the dance moves are easily applicable to a variety of songs. Then we shortlisted our top contenders for ""first dance"" song and she spent a considerable amount of effort listing the pros and cons of each song choice and ultimately helping us pick the perfect song. Ultimately Krystyna choreographed an entire dance routine taking into account our preferences. She was even considerate enough to integrate some middle eastern flavors to our dance.

We are really excited to show off our new moves (especially since we're total novices) in a couple of weeks. We'll definitely be returning for group classes in the future. It's a great and friendly place. Highly recommended!"
shoSMZu0vDoiBfTn1MmlxQ,E_f3la6qTuQE5iw1k8C3ag,"I can't recommend this store to anyone for eyewear.  I purchased my first pair of glasses from here last July and have had nothing, but problems with the lenses.  First, they never discussed with me what kind of lenses I wanted and I ended up having many quality issues with my lenses.  The anti-reflective coating failed repeatedly and I had to keep bringing it back to them so they could replace the lenses.  This happened about 5 times and they never suggested any reason why this may be happening.  The last few months the issue began to happen again and I took them in for replacement another 3-4 times.  Finally, one of the opticians suggested that it may be because I am leaving them in a hot location.  I did some research online and discovered that some lenses will fail if exposed to heat stresses.  This is commonly known as ""crazing"".  Why it took so long for someone to determine that this may be the problem is beyond me.  Also, I think the fact that the lenses are so susceptible to crazing suggests they are of poor quality and  not worth purchasing.  Now I have to make sure I store my glasses at room temperature, which is very inconvenient because I typically liked to have them available in my car for driving.  Clearly there are issues with the quality of lenses this store uses and there is a lack of education among some of the staff to have missed this common problem of crazing so many times.  The last time I went to replace my lenses they told me that this is the last time they will replace them and that now if the lenses fail again I will have to pay to replace them.  I found the  level of quality to be unsatisfactory and will not return to this store."

Since we couldnt get an appointment for a quote on the weekend, I left work early so we could meet at 4:00 at my house. 4:00 came and went, but I waited a while knowing traffic might be bad. At 4:15, I called. Cam didnt seem to know who I was when I told him my name. Then he checked his notes and remembered. He had forgotten to transfer my appointment from his notes to his schedule. I reminded him that I took off work to meet and it was a pretty big deal. No apology, he just asked if I can do it Friday morning. I reminded him that I work. He asked when is a good time for me... I said ""now was a good time"".  
I decided based on the 1st impression, this job is too important to have someone forgetting to show up, so I'm not calling back. I'm floored, because my belief is to get a job, you show your best work and make a good impression. I guess they don't believe that here.

But when I drove to Montreal with a couple of buddies for New Year's, we made a point of going first thing. It did not disappoint.

Imagine the last scene of Raiders of the Lost Ark, only with crates full of bottles instead of mystical relics. There is a so-so selection of beers, as with most SAQs. The back wall has spigots of wine, so you can bring your own jugs and fill 'er up if you're a wino throwing a party. When we went, we got enough beer and liquor to last five hard-drinking guys four days for around $150; that's about as economical as you can get. Just don't tell that to your liver."

I made an appointment for an eye exam to get contact lenses on a Wednesday afternoon. When I called the man asked me about my insurance. I gave them a slew of information from both of my insurance cards, my personal information and my contact information. 
 I arrived about 10 minutes early for my appointment and walked into the store. It is very sleek and stylish. There was only one other customer in the store. I walked up to the front desk, manned by a middle-aged woman with super short hair and great glasses. She was talking on the phone. It was blatantly obvious that was not a business call! She nodded to me. As I waited for her, I became uncomfortable listening to her private call. As I paced about a bit, I noticed the eye doctor's desk. 
I walked over to that desk. It was manned by a teenage, blond-haired young man with his head down using his phone. I stood there for literely about a minute and a half and he never looked up. Then a middle aged woman, with an accent, came walking down the hall and yelled ""Can I help you?"" I told her I was here for my appointment. She gave me a clipboard and told me to sit down. Once she got behind the desk, I asked her if she need my insurance cards. She said she did not because they did not take my insurance. I was stunned for two reasons. First my co-workers told me they had purchased glasses at Lenscrafters with our company insurance. Secondly because the office had all of my information for 6 days and never called to inform me of the issue. I took the day off work for this appointment! The woman told me that the exam would cost me $170. Any reasonable person would see how that was not and acceptable solution, when you have insurance. I was mid-sentence with the woman asking why they did not call me, when her cell phone went off in her pocket. She proceeded to answer it, right there, at the desk, standing in front of me. She began to speak in a foreign language to the person on the other end. I was appalled. I set my clipboard down and walked out. Luckily for me, no one seemed to care. 
 I really hope this review will save others the time and hassel that I experienced at this store. I also hope the Lenscrafters' management takes note of this lack of customer service. Employees are the public representitives of your business. Your reputation can make or break your business. This type experience is certainly not going to bring you new customers!

e2QV1_gH8R2Klr4w2PRSow,6PKxQ07QMnzqzuoi8pEWbg,"Have eaten here twice, and take out twice for their jarred bolognaise sauce and choucroute to take home. Just cant get enough of this resto. Everything was amazing and authentic just like in Alsace. 
The flamms are ""to die for"" and the married couple who own and operate the resto together are very attentive. 
If there is only one thing that could be made fancier is the desserts, many of which are on the simple side. Barring that, this place would be just over the top."
AgHXtE1Tc9W9ER3mABz2WQ,wkjMqLbrll4gYH0RcGbchw,"It is unfortunate , my husband and I used to get pretty good care from Southwest Dental, however,since Gentle Dental took over Southwest Dental  the past year this location has gone downhill. Have been going there for almost 9 years. Love Zerrin the hygienist, absolutely fantastic and she is why my husband and I return . My visit  about 4 months ago was suppose to be a cleaning, an annual, a repair and the dentist was not there. He was getting ready to leave. Did he not look on the schedules to see there are patients that are having annual check ups and x rays. Today, it was like a ghost town, no dentist, no patients . Shouldn't a dental office have a dentist? I was suppose to get my annual today and xrays, try again, and again no dentist. Was told he leaves at 2pm. Maybe the desk people when scheduling should be aware of this. This place needs a full time dentist and needs help during the transition. I can't see people getting cared for if there was an emergency or couldn't get out of work to get there. Last year, the lab they used for my husband's implant left things out of the box 2 times and had to re do the whole thing causing even more delays. Sure hope they have a new lab. The girl from 4 months ago that was checking me out and could not process my discount card was suppose to save and put the card in my file and my discount postcard to use for this time was gone.  Was hoping to find the office manager to tell all this too, but she was gone too. I will try 1 more time next year and hope there is a new dentist and keeps a schedule and is there for patients. Maybe we will move to another office."

The owner is very nice and she offered me soft drink when I arrived. The shop is fairly new to the area, very clean. I showed her the picture of what i wanted and Lin did the cutting! Lin has been very helpful with the suggestion, i feel like she is one of the few hairstylist i've encountered that actually like what they are doing."

On a Thursday night I made a delivery order, tried to order their whole wheat crust and was told they were out of it. Ordered the Mio Special - they take all the ingredients beef, mushroom, onions, green peppers, pineapples and grind it up into a mush. Meat is placed on the surface. The mush was tasteless! We are disappointed because we have been looking for a thin crusted whole wheat crust."

I was depressed and had a lot of anxiety. Sheila Howe helped me deal with traumatic events from my past and showed me compassion and never judged me. She taught me healthy and effective ways to cope with the present.  Therapy has vastly improved the quality of my life. I am so grateful for Sheila.

I've bought 2 from here along with pipes, accessories & service on both. The first problem I have with my bike & they treat me like they've never seen me before. 17 days & counting to get a part. After a week they realized they forgot to order it all together. Maybe it's because it's warranty work & they're not making money on it?! Very poor customer service!"

3FsO5T0X57pAbixNkcyvxg,HaPtQKTZmtIDjyKzjaCmqA,"It seemed like it took forever for this place to finally open. It's located in the shopping center on Stephanie and Horizon, and I passed by for like six months waiting to see what all the fuss was about. Finally, we decided to go the moment it opened its doors. As soon as my boyfriend walked in, he was totally freaked out, but this place is a kid's dream ice cream palace! He was freaked because there is a piano in the sitting area that plays on its own, and a life size replica of Barbara Bush is sitting on top of it. President George Dubya himself is ""pretending"" to play for her, and it just looks creepy. There is a plasma screen above them, showing of cartoon images of their 150 various sundaes. I could see why he was so jumpy. There are two options for ordering; take out or sit down. We decided to sit down. I chose the seat directly to the left of the piano. It was either this or next to the talking parrot above your head. So random. Anyway all of the sundaes are around $4.89. They are pretty big though, and well worth it. I decided to go with a kid's size P.B. Bear. This was a scoop of rocky road ice cream complete with pink jelly bean eyes and peanut butter bar ears. Cute, but too intense for me. I picked around the goodies and just ate the ice cream. Jordan downed his triple scoop mint chocolate sundae in about three seconds, he wanted to leave so fast! This place would be best for a kid's party, so long as you don't mind cleaning up the vomit induced from all the sugar. Seriously. This place really should be called Ice Cream CALORIE overload. Bring your kids, not your boyfriends."
5bRAFc_cUveunXH20SGPDg,2Kgd8_CKyYMvauEA6Z0mAA,"This is a very basic gym in the downtown area. I'll give it points for being close to transit. I came here for the gym facilities, and at my first visit was  given the 5 second tour by the receptionist. She was nice, but seemed pre occupied  with other things she had to do. The gym wasn't very busy for a Saturday afternoon which was nice. No need to sign up for the cardio machines like you do at the Talisman. I would recommend this gym for those who want a place to workout in that's not intimidating. Its also less costly than other gyms. Although I didn't see the trainer they said they had overseeing the fitness area, it's nice knowing there is someone available to ask for tips. The Y does many
Good things for the surrounding community on top of being a fitness facility, but I can't say I'd go back again if I didn't have a free pass.

I was recommended to The Style Merchant and to see Lenore by a friend. My friend knew I was extremely picky about who cut my hair because I had only been to trendy upscale salons and suggested Lenore would be a good fit for me. I have a very short hair style (men's hair cut) but chose to go to a salon because I like it to be texturized and don't like the clippers. When Lenore found out what I wanted to do to my hair and that it was a mans hair cut, she got a little frustrated (I'm assuming because she didn't want to charge for a mans hair cut) she then suggested a BARBER is probably what I'm looking for!!!!! WOW!! Who does she think she is? Get off your high horse and have some class..."
R34i-9i-bo83im6OMiE_JQ,jae1cBvdz_CGQ2r9LX8iFQ,"I wanted to review the cafe at the museum, not the museum itself, so I started a separate file in the restaurant category. Someone else reviewed the cafe on the museum file, but it was from about a year ago, and I believe the kitchen has since changed hands. 

So, my review...this is an elegant cafe only open for lunch. If you're looking for a delicious, substantial, and classy place to have lunch while you're wandering around downtown (or if you work downtown and you're on your lunch break), this is a really great option. For the summer they have both an indoor dining room and a beautiful outdoor terrace. the museum has a purple 'urban forest' display set up outside, so if you eat on the terrace you'll be surrounded by purple trees. 

Seeing as it was quite hot the day we went, my lunchtime companion and I decided to dine indoors in the AC. My lunch date (my brother) was here in Montreal on vacation, so we started off our lunch with some delicious white wine by the glass. They have quite a nice little selection of both red and white by the glass, if you are in the mood to go back to the office a little happier than you left. As an appetizer we each had a cold soup. I had the pea and my brother had the cucumber. Both very nice and refreshing and cutely served in mason jars. We then had the polenta with cod and the duck. The polenta was fluffy and the cod was light but creamy. The duck was deliciously rich and well portioned for lunch. And to top it all off, we had a chocolate creme brulee and a lemon tart. The creme brulee was a bit sweet for my brother, but I found it went well with our espressos, and the lemon tart was a nice combination of sweet and sour. 

Overall, a really great lunch experience. The prices seem a bit much for lunch, but for the quality of food that we ate, I really didn't mind splurging! We left pleasantly full."

They always check every possible shipping company to make sure I get the best deal and the quickest delivery. They are always pleasant and courteous. Last Christmas there was an employee who went out of his way and over and above to help me get my packages to my destination in time for Christmas. I have never had to wait more than 5 minutes and usually there is no line at all. They also have cute cards to look through and all the packing items you might need. I will always choose Alpha Mailbox for my mailing and shipping!

So much cheaper and yummier than any other near by cafes (I went to all three within the building)

it's really comfy here... they have couches, wifi, power outlets, and stands so it's a perfect place for studying!! Background music is played softly, and is off sometimes! it's really quiet here! Def recommend for uptown students to come here for some coffee and to study, 
there aren't many people coming in and out, which is good for me but not good for the business. 

I don't recommend their signature puffs. they are mediocre. 
but their coffee is def. recommended, I love their coffees !
Tea lattes and tea are really nice here too (I recommend rosebud tea and milk tea)"

Apparently the tenant just has to trust that repairs and cleaning will be done before move-in - and if you refuse to move in you lose your deposit unconditionally.

PdBpq6fknpl1mL9MwXoF1A,j_Ziqav6gP-BG-47tuogKQ,Have been a patient here for 7-8 years. And I have LOVED it! But recently things are going very very south. I just had some labs done and the physician wanted me to make an appointment and charge me to come in so he could tell me that they are NORMAL. This is just sleazy practice to me. He ordered the labs so he had to look at them anyway. The visit to tell me that they were normal would only line his pocket with money. I am sadly going to look for another physician to see. Btw- this review is about innovative primary care as a whole. Not dr. Levitt per se since I never actually saw her. Also- VERY high turnover in providers.

The owner, Frank, is friendly and personable and makes a point of getting to know you.

They carry fish that is not usually served at your everyday sushi restaurant.  The amberjack sashimi was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and the seafood suimono soup tasted as amazing as it looked and smelled.

For $70 for a couple for dinner, this authentic Japanese restaurant is a bit pricey but is worth every penny you spend."

I walked in with a roll of quarters to pay for my product and apologized for using change. (Can be quite frustrating considering other customers maybe waiting.) he assured no need to apologize and mentioned he was short on quarters anyway. It was small, but it made a situation that was uncomfortable for me a little less embarrassing. Sir, if by chance you read this, seriously thank you."

ENjnrsK_HHvVWFseMoVzNw,sZs8w3mSXdCo-59dwSW8zQ,"UPDATE TO MY REVIEW BELOW...

So as reported in recent news, the PhysioMed deal fell apart. The gyms are now back to being owned by Premier Fitness. News reports regarding past and current employees not being paid has been confirmed by current Yorkdale employees. A number of Premier locations have been closed permanently. The Yorkdale location remains open for the time being thanks to private investors. 

What looked top be a possible turn around for this location has crumbled, allowing the gym to revert back to it's original less than stellar state. I feel quite bad for current employees who to their credit continue to show up to work for literally nothing while the legalities are sorted out. Without these people Premier would have yet another group of member demanding refunds. Hopefully head office, as backwards as they appear to be,  appreciate the efforts of the Yorkdale staff and paying them soon."

Every year they even drain the pool and continuously the hot tub and keep it very clean and serviced. They have a pool that is 25 yards long and four lanes. And a smaller pool for exercising and heated to 92 deg. The large pool around 82. So if your looking for a good place, friendly staff, and the people who use it is kind and helpful."

lrmHXLbA5a8KQrXKoQtCig,tpCynrQxeH_xfzIAmEYWJg,"After both my elderly folks ended up in hospitals within weeks of each other, and subsequently had to be moved into an assisted living facility, we had no choice but to sell their home of twenty-one years. We knew this would be a daunting task because we live across the country from my parents. We needed an agent who was both willing and capable to accomplish the sale of their home in our absence. While in town to handle other affairs for our parents, we interviewed several agents. We chose Lily based on her knowledge of the market place, her sincerity, and her promise to handle all aspects of the sale so that we would not have to fly in to address any issues. 

Lily absolutely did what she promised to do and then some! She was there at the house to oversee and check the results of the house and carpet cleaning crews, repairs made by a plumber, whom she recommended (and did an great job at an excellent price), and Lily stayed in constant communication to update us on any and all details during the process of the marketing, showing, and selling of the house. Because of Lily's expert handling, the whole process for us was stress free. After being on the market for about 40 days, the house is now in escrow. We gave Lily a 5 star rating, but she deserves a 10 star rating! We could not have found a more perfect agent to handle the sale of my parents house. Thank you, thank you, Lily! If looking for a realtor to handle your real estate needs, you would do well to give Lily a call."

qyGMq7EorcHzxSEq36yi4Q,7gDs-4P86ccNcqqLcSTCbA,"Very professional, good prices offered for scrap gold, one of the highest in the area.  They have a flat rate they give per gram of gold, depending on its carat, unlike some other stores and pawn shops who just make a number up out of thin air and try to get you to sell your gold for the lowest amount possible.

Staff was very friendly and helpful, even recommended I hold onto a couple pieces that had diamonds because the value for small diamonds is not very high, and I didn't want to part ways with the piece of jewelry unless i could get an amount worth it.

I highly recommend this business if your planning on selling any of your jewelry for the scrap gold value, or would like to have a piece of jewelry valued for its metal value (usually more $ than any aesthetic value).

After it was over and I got home and the numbness wore off, I felt like my bite was off. So I called the dentist office to see if they could adjust it because I was going out of town the next day and didn't want to be uncomfortable the whole time during my vacation. The office advised me I could come back in but the other dentist will have to make the adjust because Dr. Stewart had already left for the day. It was 5pm. By the time I got to the office Dr. Stewart had returned to the office to make the adjustment himself. He stated he remembered I was going on vacation the next day and didn't want me to be uncomfortable. Talk about customer service.

J3w2hLfV55bswBeQYFg7Og,YcAGoje2JUEyfBCzUNsGFA,"Firstly, Jose responded quickly to my request to provide an estimate for my property. Time is of the essence since I want to put my horse property on the market in the next month and my yards are in need of a serious makeover. Jose is so knowledgeable about landscaping and plants. Truly, he is a knowledgeable botanist. He was able to know exactly what needs to be done and is designing the garden with the eye of an artist. I will provide photos on Yelp when the job is completed. If you want a trustworthy, honest, very knowledgeable landscape professional, without question call LEAFERS LANDSCAPING.

I truly couldn't be more pleased with both my front and my back gardens. My front yard, which was in desperate need of upgrading, color and a professional touch, is now everything I would hope it would be and much more. The front walkway was made to be more beautiful and inviting and now draws the eye beautifully to the front door. The garden is now elegant and has texture and variety. The garden was edited for symmetry and plants were replanted in grouping that made more sense. Jose has such an understanding of plants and placement and this comprehensive design was something I couldn't have never done on my own.

The back garden was also revamped complete with new rocks, a working fountain and lots of colorful plants. My tree was trimmed and now looks much healthier and happier too! I could not be more pleased!

Thank you JOSE and LEAFERS LANDSCAKING for making my gardens all that they could be. If you are looking for a trustworthy and professional landscaper you will be very pleased."

fIIwsdMo7aZA1UuGtrfScg,11crz9bB6E6D3pjgMqsmfw,"In February of 2012 I decided to put my home on the market.  I had used John in the best to do some remodeling and he had done a great job.   I contacted him and ask him to look over the house inside and out, top to bottom and make suggestions as to what I needed to replace or repair.  During his inspection he pointed out things that needed attention.  Some things that I thought would surely have to be replaced John was able to repair and make them good as new.  Together we worked on the 2500 square foot house for two months.  I handled the cleaning and de-cluttering while he handled the repair and/or replacement.  
     We were done with the home and ready to turn it over to the realtor on the 1st of April.  I was prepared for a long summer of waiting for it to sell.  Boy was I surprised when I received an excellent offer in just nine days.  During the inspection process there were just two minor items that needed attention and John took care of them to perfection.  I would, and have, highly recommend John to anyone needing any type of home repair.  John can do it all and at a very reasonable price."

I tried Koko out on a Groupon, loved it, but couldn't decide if it was worth the price tag. Six months later, two different gyms, and a zillion different fitness attempts, I was back. Koko guides you through your workout session, and if you go during business hours there is a staff member who can answer your questions and help perfect your form. The koko smart trainers are like having your own personal trainer every time you work out, not just once a week. And the membership price is way less than a gym membership and a trainer.

Between the 15 minutes of cardio and the 30 minutes of strength,  3 - 4 times a week,  I am on my way to being in the best shape of my life. Most of all, I don't dread going to the gym. Double bonus.

The staff is super personable, extra friendly, and the owners are very involved at what goes on at all the clubs. I would definitely recommend Koko to anyone looking for a great place to start their fitness journey."

The won ton soup sure tasted great when I had a bad cold and their beef with broccoli is second to none. The food is made to order and always pipping hot, even after a 10 minute car trip home. Defiantly a place to go for Chinese food and they're actually even better then a lot of the all you can eat buffets out there."

So to describe the sketchy of this store... It's not the cleanest thrift store and it's pretty cluttered. The street outside the store is a little rough (the entrance to the store has a chain cage around it) but if you go during the day time, all the businesses are open and it's not too bad. There are some weird people that shop there, but that goes with most thrift stores, this one might have the highest population of strange people I've seen in Toronto...

That said! I found a GREAT pair of boots that were an expensive brand and almost new for $9. They have a ton of winter coats and a lot of housewares. I also have bought a bunch of books there before because they are pretty inexpensive and a good variety. They have weekly family specials (""All toys 50%!) as well as a lot of christmas stuff for the holidays.

Whatever treasure you end up buying here, I'm sure it's awesome! Just make sure you wash it first..."

Also, the dogs are freely running around so I find they arn't nearly as traumatized as some places I have been. For me, what's best is not only the quality, but also the fact I can book an appointment and its next week rather than next month :) Great job ladies!"

Went in on a Saturday and they were quite slow, which I didn't expect but I guess the location would do better during the business wk. I wasn't greeted warmly nor was I offered refreshments...which is fine I don't expect that. I explained to my tech that I wanted both my pedi n mani w no polish as I like to give them a break between shellacs.  The pedi was what I've come to expect. Decent and not stellar. I was looking fwd to the hot stone massage at the end...word to those who've actually had a hot stone massage...this is not that. The tech retrieved two stones from a heater, covered my legs w a hot towel and then rubbed under the ball of my feet w the stone in a circular motion maybe 5 times. There was not even enough pressure to really even do any good. It was more of a hot stone tickle. Pointless. Why advertise something and not deliver properly? I'd pay any extra $5-7 for some time and pressure in a massage and I'm sure most women would agree. My mani was decent too tho some nails were cut too short on the sides leaving her no choice but to give me uneven nails. Also had some shellac leftover on the sides which I removed when I got home. Whatev. $40. Don't think I would return. Everyone in the salon was nice enough. I'm just really looking for a place that people take pride in their work."

pZf3WkFm9x91JWFYh8CLKg,DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg,"Pretty good mexican with some strengths and flaws.  

This is a Seattle Jaliscan transplant that serves pretty good food but their kitchen is a bit slow.  Unlike most Jalisco restaurants, there is no tequila but that may change when they get their liquor license.

Our first vist was okay.  They bring out chips and pieces of bread that is not baked on premise.  (I saw one of their employees bringing in supplies through the front door and he had 3 loaves of purchased bread and 2 bottles of what looked like apple juice.)

Their chips were cold and the salsas were unusual.  One was a green tomatillo based salsa that was decent and another was a chile and peanut sauce (bright orange) that was a bit better.  They also brought out a cream cheese white spread for the bread.  Overall I didn't like it as much as the typical red salsa and warm chips you usually get.

I had the steak on cactus leaf and my girlfriend had the cheese enchiladas with mole.  She absolutely fell in love with that dish and I thought it was very good too.  My steak was not tender, slightly overdone but covered with an interesting sauce.  The beans were okay and the plain-looking white rice tasted much better than you would think.

It took a minute to get seated and almost 15 mnutes to get served despite the fact the restaurant wasn't crowded.  It is an L shaped restaurant with 5 separate rooms so you may be out of view of your server during part of your meal.

We ordered take-out and got different dishes--beef enchiladas with their red sauce, a chicken dish Maria Izquierdo and coconut shrimp.  All were excellent and I would have bumped them up to being one of the better Mexican restaurants in Vegas except...

I called ahead and was told that it would be ready in 10-15 minutes.  I arrived about 25 minutes later and had to wait another 8 minutes.  It was a weekend night but there were only 10 diners there because I had plenty of time to walk around so I counted them.  They put their takeout in large aluminum pans.  Perhaps they own stock in Alcoa?

PRO:

1.  Excellent mole.
2.  Very good sauces all around.
3.  Quality of cooking pretty high level.
4.  Better menu variety than typical Mexican restaurant.

CONS:

1.  No liquor yet.
2.  Kitchen not very fast.
3.  Chips and Salsa not typical and not very good (Some might prefer the difference but I don't).
4.  Clunky oversized menu.  Difficult to move back and forth between pages to decide. 
5.  Physical layout not the best design although not a huge place.

Went back again on 2/9/08 (we live nearby) and this time got Filete Urupuan and the girlfriend got the same cheese enchiladas with mole.  Meat was tough but very good sauce.  Enchiladas had seasme seeds this time.  Also they have stopped serving the cream cheese with their salsas."
9pmkEITiV92iaqWDeWQSfg,hZUm_h2nZbhekRwX-cJUiw,"This is a long overdue review. We were referred to Michelle by our lender Judy Giel (Guild Mortgage - GREAT to work with btw!) and we could not be more thankful. 

Michelle was our agent in selling our 4-plex in Phoenix. She did a great job taking over from a previous agent at a different company who did not know what they were doing. She helped stage/prep/coordinate with the property manager and tenants throughout the process. She gave us updates every step of the way and we truly appreciated that as we were out of town owners. 

We had quite a number of offers (thanks to her great marketing and her network) and she helped us navigate the down selection of our buyer. The situation became complicated when the buyer's bank gave additional hurdles for all of us to jump over but Michelle handled it with great professionalism and was able to help resolve anything that came up throughout the transaction. 

If you're looking for a talented go-getter with a great attitude and sense of humor...Michelle is the one to work with hands down!"

My husband has been going here for over 20 years and has had great service and felt that he has not been overcharged in all these years. He really felt comfortable going here, and planned his time to go here when he could have gone somewhere else that had more conducive hours to our work schedule. 

Well all of this changed today and we will NOT EVER go back to Bell Lawn Mower. Of all people the owner is who treated us poorly. For whatever reason, this person did not ask my husband why we were there today; he just started off the conversation by lecturing my husband about the condition his lawnmower looked to be in. My husband patiently waited for him to finish and asked if he could tell him what the problem was. Once he got out what the problem was, the owner immediately lashed out at my husband insinuating things about him and his character, and started calling my husband names. When I got involved the owner started insinuating to my husband that ""his wife knew he was bad person."" I told this person to stop what he was doing and that I knew no such thing. This experience was so confusing and crazy that it made me think that this guy has a serious medical issue. This was beyond poor customer service and we will continue to let others know not to go here."

I started off the conversation by telling the guy who answered the phone that I have a Briggs & Stratton lawnmower and he interrupted me by saying, ""so you have a Briggs & Stratton lawnmower?"", as if he was somehow confused by what I said.  I then clarified and told him that it is actually a Montgomery Ward lawnmower with a Briggs & Stratton engine.  He then began chuckling under his breath and said, ""so you have a Briggs & Stratton lawnmower... was that your question?"" (More laughing to himself), then he says, ""did I miss something? Was that your question? Yea we work on Briggs & Stratton lawnmower's"".  Bottom line is it is clear he was laughing at me as if I'm some moron who doesn't know he was calling a lawnmower repair shop or whatever it is he was thinking.  I was simply trying to tell him what lawnmower I had before asking if they could do the repair that I needed in the time frame and price I was asking for.  Instead he takes the opportunity to practice his sit-down comedy act I guess.  A business that treats a potential customer like that  won't get my business.

Still had desserts with Christmas decorations on and it was early February... Old? Stale? 

Their display cases look worn and and reflects on the desserts making them all look past their date and unappealing .

wTbHEY6aQ2MB2zzYPnm9Bw,zSyRQOAPSwtMLxW_GKNVFA,"My husband and I had our wedding (both the ceremony and reception) at the Capitol Event Theatre this past January (2012). And we are extremely happy that we did. I am a corporate event planner for a living and as such I have very high expectations for venues. Thankfully, all of my expectations were met and some were actually surpassed.

They were able to work within our budget (being off-season helped too), and the value was absolutely fantastic for such a beautiful venue in uptown Toronto. It was large enough to comfortably accommodate our party of 130 but still felt intimate. It was very convenient to have the ceremony and the reception in the same place. We kicked things off with the ceremony at 5pm followed by cocktail hour/passed h'or deouvres (on the balcony level) and then a seated dinner and late night snacks around 11pm and open bar all night long.

I cannot rave enough about how good the service was. Caterina, our event coordinator made us feel at ease leading up to the big day and answered all our questions. Mark made sure that we stayed on track during the big day and cued the DJ and the person operating the lights. All the servers, including the head server Dalton were extremely on the ball. The bartenders Chris and Gary were a delight and their repertoire of shots/shooters rivals most bars I've been to. They also named the signature cocktail after me which was very cute.

Oh, and the food - the most important thing! As a foodie, I normally wouldn't order chicken in restaurants let alone for my wedding reception. But the chicken was out of this world. Super juicy in a balsamic reduction. The guests absolutely loved it. We also had the salmon. I thought it was done nicely but fish is a tricky thing because people tend to be pickier about how its cooked. The h'or deouvres were all solid but the lamb chop loliipops were absolutely AMAZING. 

We had many out of town guests and booked a room block around the corner at the Best Western Roehampton Suites. It was clean, convenient and had much better rates than we could find anywhere downtown.

All that to say that we (and our guests) simply adored this venue. Sincere thanks to the gang there!

I would not hesitate to recommend The Capitol Event Theatre to anyone looking for an original venue, with lots of charm, fantastic service and delicious food."

After that, i again asked the store manager (STORE MANAGER:ANTHONY WNOROSKI ) to see what has happened to make the engine light turned on, and the manager replied in such a rude way that the engine light on was not because of the oil change and asked me to go back to the home. The manager was very much ill-experienced and doesn't know how to deal with the customers, i strongly suggest to train such poorly-trained managers to train well. And, again i asked the manager if he could put the scanned and look for the error codes, but he denied to do that. He said that i need to pay about $50 for scanning the engine light on codes. What the hell is that fee for?...I paid about 32 dollar for engine oil change, and the inexperienced technicians do something wrong in my car, and for that problem i have to pay $50 dollar? NO WAY, they have to fix the problem. But the manager denied to run the scanner. THE ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON JUST AFTER THE OIL CHANGE AND, IT WAS THE MANAGER'S RESPONSIBILITY TO SCAN FOR THE ERROR CODE. You know, nobody takes their vehicle to the service center for adding problem to their vehicle, and i didn't took too. If monro is not going to repair for my check engine light on, i would NEVER EVER recommend anyone to go to monro. I dont want anyone to have bad experience like me."

Edb_Bhss_sL_Ip-UHhWo8Q,GtW4vbSpCoZMBmojEUYDhw,"My husband and I had our wedding there in April. We selected this venue because they were able to accommodate fairly large group (120 people) with 6-7 months notice and the reasonably priced menu. They also offered a fairly turn-key solution, including a complimentary menu tasting.
The food and service at the tasting were quite good. We opted for their ""distinction menu"" with several canapes including (fillet mignon skewers, fig and marscapone, chicken and olive bites).
However, as the wedding approached, things began to unravel. 
About a month before the wedding we let them know that we would be fewer people than originally anticipated. They begrudgingly agreed to this although no contract was ever signed stating that a minimum number of people were required.
In addition, having heard some horror stories from other people who were married there, I prepared detailed outlines for the room setups and timing of events for the day. The person in charge of sales (Nathalie) refused to follow the planned flow of events that we had established with all of our other vendors (bakery, florist, DJ, etc). This resulted in many arguments and really tainted our overall experience. It also resulted in our flowers being delivered later than would have been best and thereby forcing my husband to dress quickly in the washroom rather than at the hotel.
Despite the drama leading up to the event, the wedding itself went fairly well, although the sound system was quite poor outside and the table setup was mess (unpressed linens, etc). The food was ok, but definitely not the quality that we experienced at the tasting (or the same dessert).
Perhaps the lamest part of the experience, was that rather than riding off into the sunset, my husband and I were stuck there after everyone else had left to pay the balance owing. Because it was so late (in fact it was Sunday, and not Saturday), my husband's credit card company flagged the transaction for a large sum which we had warned them would occur on the Saturday (not Sunday). Not wanting to spend our wedding night on the phone with the credit card company, we requested to come in the next morning and sort out the balance then. The manager, Kevin, refused and wouldn't let us leave until the balance was paid (45 minutes).
Since then, the staff have failed to answer a single one of our emails or phone calls to have us pick up left over items from the wedding (vases, a crystal glass from my grandmother, our wedding cake topper). When we showed up in person, no one was there to help and our things were scattered everywhere with many items missing.
So in summary, if you don't care how things roll out and don't care about seeing your personal belongings ever again, this may be the place for you to host your event."
z5bVI0-so4V5Oq_EByTumA,oO88JEuu86wJZ2mhy255-g,"Don't use this florist. What I ordered for $75 could have been $15 at the grocery store! I was embarrassed. Recommended by the funeral home. Furthermore, I contacted Sandy at this merchant and she promised me a refund. Then she rescinded the offer of the refund saying she talked with the funeral home owner and 1) it was a dish garden (which it wasn't, and I did not order one anyway!); 2) the family got the plant after the viewing (they did not...it was sent to a nursing home!!); 3) she blamed the third party florist, Consolidated though she would not allow me to call them. Also she was very rude on the phone, interrupting me and being very forceful and aggressive. She was NOT going to go through with the refund she promised! Use Kopriver's in Duquesne instead and ask for Karen there!"
8JvuhiQWoMJVDVuTtvOnPA,8q4rxw9-7PSJ4Nm8Pmq2JA,"Checking out the previous reviews, I feel I may have significantly missed out by ordering online and having the food delivered to my home.  Given, though, that this was my experience, I'll share it, nonetheless, and just urge you to try it in person if you're going to bother.

My partner (an immigrant from Mexico) and I tried the quesadilla, nachos, tortilla soup, and french fries (which were a substitute for elote / corn because the restaurant had run out of corn).

The quesadilla was unexciting.  It was a flour tortilla with cheese stuffed inside and melted.  The tortilla soup, my fiance says, tasted like chicken noodle soup with crushed tortillas in it.  The fries were soggy at best, and the nachos were an atrocity.  It appeared as though they opened a bag of tortilla chips, threw on scoops of beans, avocado, and canned nacho cheese sauce, and left it alone.

By the time the food arrived, what was once hot was cold, what was once firm was soggy.

It may be because I adore Mexican food... it may be because I had it delivered instead of going into the restaurant... or it may actually be something wrong with the restaurant.  I can't say for sure based upon one experience... I can just say my one experience hasn't left me excited to try it a second time around."

They collar was completely stained with cleaning fluid. After a hostile correspondence, they offered me the price of the cleaning. The blouse was supposedly sent for ""testing"" to Alberta, but that was in the Springb and I have heard nothing.

The only reason I didn't give it a higher score is that I find the full price very high for what you get. Also, the second box I got smelled like smoke. It seems that at least one of their delivery personnel smoke in the delivery vehicle. The produce smelled fine, the smell was at least restricted to the box itself as far as I could tell."

Once Paula came in, I though my kids would begin their crying like they do with all other doctors. But they just sat there nice and calm. She has a very sweet manner and is very caring and gentle with my kids.

Had to pay $25 (The $1 up front + admin fees); it was explained to me that my $1 month (30 days) started then. Cool - I explained to Mary that I would likely be out in less than two weeks anyway.  She said I wouldn't owe them for any rent over and above this amount, as long as I gave them a 10 day notice.  On 03/14, we came to get the last of our stuff out and found that we had been locked out.  Turns out, they billed me on March 1st - YES, three days after I go the unit for $55.  This would be for the last week of March (post-30 day/$1 period).  And to top it off, since it was the 15th, I had a late fee!  I told her we were out that day, so there's her notice: a full two weeks before the end of March.  She said because they had already generated the bill, it was due.  Totally contrary to what we had discussed at the onset.  So, no matter if I came in on the 2nd and gave her my notice, we would have still been billed for the last week of March, because ""that's when we generate our bills"".  We argued until she would only concede the late fee.  These people operate on such a low level of ethics that I would never go back and I would recommend to anyone in need of storage to not be fooled by this $1 for the first month nonsense:  It cost me $80 and a heck of a lot of aggravation!!!"

I had a perfectly running car which unfortunately stopped while running and wouldn start. Given that its a toyota which has be running over 8k miles with just oil service, I suspected the no-start problem to be a small one. After the car stopped midway, I had it towed to a nearby auto repair shop , Monro muffler brake and service. They diagnosed a problem with the fuel pump and changed it. the car ran after that but only a few feet forward and the EFI fuse would keep blowing out. They spent 3 days looking into that problem, NO RESULT. I then took it to a toyota service center and paid over $100 for diagnostics. Toyota certified mechanic reported that the new fuel pump was not pumping enough fuel therefore kept blowing the fuse. The car is back at Monro muffler. I only needed a fuel pump. Its Day 5 today and they still have not given it to me. 

P.S: The above is only a brief version of what actually happened. 

Would never recommend this place to anyone. You will loose your peace of mind."

A few weeks back I went to the store and bought a sweater and a pair of pants which added up to be north of $140. I happened to wear a sweater I had bought just recently in California in a Title Nine store and it seemed like this irritated the sales person beyond belief. The sweater was also on display in the store when I came in that day. Several times she pointed out how nice the sweater was I was wearing. In general, I would think that is just a way of being nice and making customers feel welcome. However after she said it for the fourth or fifth time I had an inkling that she tried to suggest I has shop-lifted the sweater?! I felt like I needed to defend myself and I mentioned that I had bought the sweater just recently in another Title Nine Store in Cali but she would just not let go and inquired about details. I thought that was very unprofessional and they have certainly lost me as a customer. I can order all the things they sell online. In fact the selection offered at the Title Nine online store is even better."

So if you have thousands of dollars to start up at approximately 4 to 500 a month you can get on this program and be successful with Medifast weight loss centers of Arizona if not don't waste your time because they don't care you can get online and get the same support the same food and the same Stabilization Program , you don't have to pay a huge amount of money up front and if you run into hard times they will always welcome you back and by the way I only spend about 300 a month instead of 400 a month and they actually have more food available online then they do at the local stores"

I had previously gone to a similar establishment in Tempe (stay tuned for a horrible review) until I realized I was being lied to and taken advantage of. 
  When I entered "" The Gold Guy "" I was happily greeted by Larry,  Carol,  and another employee who's name escapes me right now (my apologies). After Carol offered me a bottle of water,  I showed them the items I had and was told their weight.  After Larry input the figures into his calculator,  I was given what I thought to be a fair price and accepted his offer.  I forgot my wallet at home,  but after I returned to the shop,  I was given a check for the amount and went on my way. What amazes me is that there are businesses out there that don't treat clients, especially 1st time clients with more respect and for some reason,  have the expectation they will return to conduct business  a 2nd time!! 
  At the beginning of my review,  I mentioned I was quite impressed. I was because you couldn't ask to be treated with more respect than what they offer.  I never got the feeling I was being "" hustled "" or that Larry wasn't being 100% honest and up front with me.  I was in the car business for several years where I worked with and met plenty of individuals that were of course,  the opposite so I've got a decent judgment of character.

My daughter and I went to D&I and told the clerk that we needed an attachment tool for my drill to twist wire.  The gripper on my drill was not small enough to be able to grasp my wire.  Our wire was not your typical round wire but square.  When it is twisted it makes a very cool serpentine effect that is stunning when crafting jewelry.  The sales girl said they did not have an attachment for our drill but they did have a ""Jump ring maker"" that would do the job.  We purchased it and took it home.  At home I further researched our needs and realized that this jump ring maker was NOT what we wanted.  We never opened the box.  We attempted to return it the very next day and were told no refunds, no exchanges.  Period.  We tried writing to the owner via email and got the same response; no refunds, no exchanges.  

I find it funny how the owner of this store and his employees continue to lie to defend themselves.   They have concocted an elaborate lie about my wanting to make a ridiculous amount of jump rings.  Suposedly for a window display in my salon.  sounds like that would be a very modern looking display and my salon decor was NOT modern.  
Once again,

 I tried to return the jump ring maker  the very next day because it was NOT what I needed to twist wire.  The box was not even opened, so how could I have made 60,000 jump rings with it.  What the heck would I need 60K jumps rings for?   I NEVER wanted to make jump rings and I never have.  He knows it.  He continues to lie about the experience I had with his store 3 years ago.  Every year he trots out his libelous accusations and personal slurs towards me.   How sad."

He has raised his voice at us, ignored us when we asked for help with an item, and made rude condescending remarks towards us many times over when we shopped there. Most of the neighborhood knows this place is terrible and refuse to shop there because of the nasty negative behavior. We have been here more than several times and enough is enough.

I won a free casino night at a Bridal Expo and thought it would be perfect for our rehearsal dinner. When it came time to schedule the casino night I reached out to Preston, the owner. I made the mistake of mentioning I was wanting to schedule a free casino night in my initial voicemail. No one ever got back to me. After over 3 weeks of calling and emailing, I gave up and had my Dad call (he did not mention the free night) and see if he could get through. Preston returned my Dad's call immediately - very fishy! 

I got past the awful customer service at the beginning and proceeded to book the party. We decorated the house with a casino theme and made room for the tables. Everyone was very excited for the party. 

On the night of the party, about 30 minutes past the time they were supposed to arrive, I text Preston to see what was going on. No one called beforehand to let me know they were running late. He informed me the crew had gotten a flat tire on the way to the party. He said the flat was irreparable and they would not be able to make the party. What a letdown to our house full of guests. Perhaps if they weren't honoring a free party they would have found a way to make it.

Based on the run around I was given when attempting to book the party, I have trouble believing anything this company says. They ruined our rehearsal dinner and have caused unnecessary stress during an already stressful time. 

In closing, there are many options for casino nights in Phoenix and I strongly suggest you use of them. 

DO NOT USE CASINO NIGHT 2 YOU!"

The location was great- slightly off the beaten path, right near the Parc Fontaine (which has free concerts in the summer). We also took advantage of the Bixi bike rental rack just a block away. 

Everyone mentions the three course breakfasts and we must as well. ""Beware,"" as Patryck told us- these meals are quite large and filling! They were beautifully prepared and so so delicious- one morning we had the most amazing homemade croissants and jam. Yum! 

The B&B itself was well-maintained and had comfortable-sized rooms. The shared bathroom was never an issue for us, and was always clean. We would highly recommend this spot to anyone looking for a unique place to stay in Montreal."

I joined a soccer rec team through the Toronto Sport and Social Club (TSSC) and our games take place at the Hangar Sports Dome located behind the main Hangar building. This place is A-OK! Well-heated in the cold winter months and there are portable (clean!) bathrooms just outside (they're large enough to double-up as change rooms). My only complaint is that there are no drinking fountains around, which is surprising to see at a sports venue. Make sure to bring a bottle of water to stay hydrated.

Getting here is pretty easy if you're driving and there's tons of parking. TTCing here is a different story. You can take a bus from Downsview station and then walk for 10-15 minutes from the bus stop on Sheppard St., but this walk looks pretty sketchy (especially in the dark)."

Not at all satisfied with communication and timelines.Signed contract and gave deposit for installation in early October, they came late Oct. crew was great windows were good except main picture window was damaged. Estimated time to get window sent back and repaired at factory was two weeks. At 4 weeks started calling them, finally at 6 weeks got a date for installation Dec 22 , told them I would postpone Christmas vacation and to make sure all was ready. was told the only thing that would delay this was the weather. 9am rolls around, no crew, phone call at 9:30, the wrong part was sent can't install window till January. So what happened to sending the window back to factory? Talked to Dmitri(supervisor)  about compensation for all the delays and he said he would talk to me after window was installed, and he made a big deal about saying he made a note to call me if part for window was not in by Jan 27. Jan 24 window was installed, no compensation because it was in before the 27???      
Not the end of it! by Feb noticed that on 4 of the 6 windows the caulking had pulled away and there are holes into my walls, they came and pumped more caulking in but now I have to watch it closely.
 In the end have my new windows, but the quality control guy and the supervisors need to get together and decide whether or not the whole window get sent back to the factory for repair or it's just a part that takes 7 weeks to make.Either way get closer to the same time estimate. Or just learn to communicate with customer."

While the standard pub fare is as expected, the butter chicken was really rich, tasty and generous. Served with rice and great fresh naan cooked onsite in a tandoor oven (not something you see in every pub). My only complaint was that I asked for it to be spicy, but it was only medium at best. The main thing that dragged my opinion of this place down is the very slow service. There were only two tables with food during the lunch hour we visited, yet it took 40+ minutes to get our food with no drink refills while we waited. Indian food: 4, pub food: 3.5, service: 2."

She is a true professional in her approach to handling dogs and teaching their owners. In the short time I have known her I have graduated from needing Sho's help to wanting her to help me teach my dog new things. One of my favourite things about Sho is that there is no cookie-cutter approach. she assesses the situation and knows what to do. I never had a dog before and I was pretty stressed for my first year. I have I high energy dog and I didn't know how to handle him. Now he obeys all of my commands and I can walk him around my neighbourhood with no leash. You can't accomplish these results without an in-depth understanding of how to handle dogs and knowing how to teach the dog's owners. Sho Knows!

7a7jwZ2tcUAVEpxu9OyUHQ,VTak7uZMDtcoUKNmSFE8dQ,"I just moved to Arizona and after 4 pool companies, I finally found a service that actually cares.

I had one company that came out and broke my backwash valve and charged a crazy amount per month!  I watched him take a large pipe wrench and try to force the valve out without relieving the back pressure. As an engineer , I was just waiting for the thing to snap and it did. Then he wanted  $400 to replace the valve and he billed me before the repair!

I had to fix the valve myself (for 15 dollars) and was shocked at the lack of knowledge. Plus my ph was always off because no one ever added acid.

With Crystal Glaicer , I actually like the fact they take time to  keep me informed and my pool balanced and in tip top shape, not just some company that throws clorine tabs and leaves. My pool is sparkling!

I am also at ease having someone keep an eye on my home while I am travelling.
It has been great this summer!

I dont normally give 5 stars but Crystal glaicer is worth it!"

6spBxiPv7cq3Zy0gSeQsEQ,aREJme76xRypJ3X3EAuGWA,"This is my second time living at the Village at Avon. The grounds are well kept. The leasing staff and maintenance team are cordial. I had planned to live here for several more years but as with most businesses - the management cares less about ""community"" and more about the ""bottom line."" Staff refused to negotiate a rent increase (the second in two years) and because of this, we no longer care to plant roots here. I fully understand supply and demand but I now am gaining insight into the high turnover rate of neighbors.

I too had a problem with my washer, similar to another reviewer - so much so that a neighbor has complained about the noise from my unit. I've explained to management that I do laundry very early and also very late in the day but the leasing manager is quick to judge and has yet to check on my washer. It's been two years. 

I'm sad to be moving but respect as a resident is important to me. No loyalty to someone who has lived with your community two years (and for a second time in 10 years)? It's not worth it to me."

After several weeks of searching he recommended we look at a home I wasn't initially keen on. The house was perfect and is now my first home. Throughout the process Taylor was very responsive to calls, emails and texts. I was impressed with his knowledge of not only the real estate purchase process, but also the mortgage loan and personal finance aspect of buying a home.

hm_9fXPdQgPffJP5btjVbg,9D1Z_m3x3EOEZtvVDWPfDA,"I used this Merry Maid branch services a couple of years ago and was so impressed with their service.  The staff arrived at the house with their tools.  They were very professional. They asked what I wanted them to do, and they sure did it well. During this first service I wanted an overall clean of the house, but didn't require them to go into closets or drawers.  My house smelled so good and so clean after they were done. 

Some months later I needed their services again as I was hosting an event, however, they were fully booked as I had called too late.  I scrambled and found a ""better deal"" (read: cheaper).  If I could only remember that cleaning service's name, I would write a scathing review.  Anyway, the ""better deal"" result was terrible. Dust bunnies left everywhere, my stuff rearranged even when I told them not to. So I decided after that if I can't use Merry Maid, I won't use another cleaning service again. I might as well keep my money and do the sub-par cleaning myself.

I have put my house up for sale recently. I called Merry Maid well in advance to book an appointment after the staging was complete. The staging was taking longer than expected, so I had to keep cancelling and rebooking. Merry Maid was kind enough to accommodate this hassle and they were able to fit me in right away once I told them I was ready. I emailed them on a Sunday, and they got back to me immediately on Monday to inform me that their staff is ready to come in on the Tuesday. 

I couldn't be around during the cleaning, so I had sent them an extensive list of to-dos.  The managers I worked with made sure that the cleaning staff had this on hand. The manager I worked with even came to my house to make sure the staff followed my list. I love it!

Since I wasn't around, my mother in law and realtor came by to check on the house, and they were equally impressed.  I was so happy when I arrived home. They certainly met my expectations. I checked all the items and I had asked them to do (and not touch). Everything was in order as we had left it. Everything I asked to be clean was cleaned very well.

It's too bad I'm moving out of Mississauga. I will certainly miss their top-notch service. I hope I find another cleaning service like them."

Dr. La is very considerate of my financial constraints and skepticism.  She has never recommended a supplement without good reason, and she has never been pushy about supplements or treatments.  She's very realistic about what kinds of things I can (and will) do while encouraging me when necessary. 

Dr. La takes an extremely thorough history, something I've never gotten from any MD.  She has been able to spot connections that no one else has because she asks, and she knows her stuff.  If you're considering seeing a naturopath, I 100% recommend going for a consultation at TCNM."

When my guests asked us about our gifts, that's when we realized items had been purchased from the registry. When we went to pick up our gifts, the salesperson had NO clue about what happened to one of our gifts. And I had to call back several times to find out what happened. 

VERY disorganized and unhelpful. Totally regret registering for gifts here. Don't do it if you can avoid it"

Clearly frozen, almost twice too big for the bug (why have an oblong burger for a round bun), and thick and dense. Note to self: Stick to chicken from Swiss Chalet.

Even if the burger meat was good, there's no customization. It's possible to pick off the pickle, but it's not possible to scrape off all the mayo, since it's soaked into the bun, and they put so much on that it oozes out onto the other things in the container."

These folks take time to give proper attention to your needs with relieving therapy as well as finessed adjustment and preventative measures.  Genuinely caring people.  Thank you for helping me to salvage my vacation!!"

When I asked about it, they did not have a price for it and wanted me to wait while they ""researched it"" online--because the person who brought it in didn't know what to charge and wanted the owner of the store to set the price for it. I finally got tired of waiting and left. The store had a back room that was cordoned off from shoppers...maybe they should put merchandise that is not ready for sale in that area to save shoppers some frustration. They did have some nice items, but I felt too frustrated by my experience to bother with them."

After frustrating visits to the doctors, who did not look into my health issues closely enough, Karen was able to help me change the way I ate.  No guilt, no diet, no restrictions, just a common sense approach with helpful suggestions.  I didn't know how bad I felt, until I felt so good.  Eating bread every day (like Oprah) is not for me, but I don't have to... I still lost 17lbs.  and I feel terrific. My new eating lifestyle is not a challenge but an adventure.

But the last time I was there, the worker dealing with order taking didn't seem to be interested in providing decent service to any of the customers. I admit it was very busy so maybe the worker was just needing a break. I hope the owner can see this so the employee can given some advice on how to handle customers even at times of rush.

YN58Coh1nvnsNS0FXIeAKg,JjeohDyWhRC6XcY9n3XTAA,"We worked with Erin for over a year before our wedding. We hired her as a full time wedding planner. I started out having only a couple vendors, Erin worked very closely with us, and helped us find all of our other vendors, always within our budget.

Every step of the way Erin was sending email updates, and keeping all my vendors up to date on timing for everything. My mom was a little overbearing during the process, and Erin helped assure her that her & her team had everything under control, and that (being my wedding) as long as what I wanted happened it would be a ""Divine Day"". Which it most defiantly was! Throughout the planning Erin was so helpful & friendly, and was so easy to talk to!

The day of my wedding  Erin's team was there as I was getting ready in the hotel keeping everyone on time (mainly my mom & sister), and making sure I had everything I needed. The ceremony went as planned, and Erin & her team helped my guests out of the church quickly, so that Jim & I could have photos at the altar without people crowding us.

Cocktail hour, Erin's team made sure we got to enjoy the appetizers I had selected for my guests by bringing my girls & I plates of them in our hotel room, while Jim socialized with our guests.  

Erin showed us our reception before our guests arrived in the room & it was so much more beautiful than I had ever expected it to turn out! The way Erin & her team put everything together was absolutely beautiful.

The reception, Erin's team made sure the DJ was on time with announcing everything, and lined us up for our grand entrance. She made sure for the rest of the night everything ran (as smoothly as it could with my family). 

Erin saved us so much stress (and money). She made it so I could really just relax & enjoy my wedding day. My sister just got engaged & she plans on hiring Erin & her team for the wedding as well. Erin is so worth what I payed, and more!

Thank you so much Divine Team for making my wedding day perfect"

They were holding the line back in single degree weather for no apparent reason. When I finally get in I get to wait another 15 minutes for their coat check ( which they force you to do). Then I  see one song from one of the openers who killed it ! The crowd was really pumped until antics comes out.  I feel like every time I have been to segrado antics is one of the openers and it really killed the energy in the building. People went from dancing to just standing around talking to each other for most of their set.  I ended up leaving before the main act came on and people were still waiting outside.  Overall a waste of money and poor crowd management

If you don't believe me, check out owner Sue's facebook! A complete disgrace. I'm honestly embarrassed that these loons are even able to keep their venue in business.

DPZf7Ao2nZaZ5OMWOLR8Xg,COCFG_GG74JOD2BcGzQc3A,"I really wish I could leave a positive review for this establishment. I'm an inveterate reader who buys ways too many books, a haunter of libraries, a sometime writer, and a strong supporter of independent bookstores. But due to an unfortunate incident that occurred a couple of years ago, and which continues to grate, I am unable to do so.

What happened? I entered the bookstore in search of a gift for my partner's nephew. A store employee, or possibly the store manager, followed me from the entrance, all the way to the children's section at the back, and then all the way back to the cash register at the front. During this entire trajectory, he never once asked me if I needed any help. From the look on his face, he was viewing me with suspicion.

Bottom line: if you want to be treated like Trayvon Martin, or if you want to do business with a bookstore that treats its customers in this way, then this is the bookstore for you."

First we are all around a 10 handicap, second there were about 8 cars in the parking lot. I am upset with my visit to Twin Lakes, the Pro shop worker was very condescending and rude.

ddAS_VgYW22FdSaWR9fR9w,XwNzco5WauvhFkqkDxLiQA,"Bottom Line:  Good ice cream, great service, needs a better selection of non-dairy frozen treats.

For the handful of folks out there who aren't familiar with the like of Cold Stone, Maggie Moo's, or Marble Slab, let me give you a basic rundown.  You walk up to the counter, pick your ice cream from probably about a dozen flavors, and then pick your mix-ins from a variety of candy, fruit, and crushed up candy bars.  The ice cream professional behind the counter then mixes them all together in front of you before handing you your frozen treat in either a bowl or waffle cone.  The portions are usually very generous and the service tends to have a little pizazz thrown in.

This particular Marble Slab seems to excel at the service aspect.  The ice cream is good, but what I really noticed was the service.  There were 3 groups of people in line all at once, with probably about 8 people total.  Even though there was only 1 guy on at the time, he still kept up with all of us at once, giving out samples, making ice cream, and ringing people out, and none of seemed to get bored or antsy waiting on him.  

The 1 complaint I have is that they need a greater variety of non-dairy treats.  My wife does not eat dairy products and her choices were limited to 2 flavors of a type of sorbet.  It was good, but more choice would be nice."

Less than 36hrs later I am back in my car, which is running just like new and at a fraction of the cost for a dealer service.

JpU4vB4twBCe73VN-S7ARA,PtIRbUAj2YtyOiFWKheMgQ,"I am very unhappy with the pharmacy service at this CVS, they did not submit my husband's prescription to our insurance, instead running it through a ""discount card"" (no idea where they got that as we did not give it to them) and charging us $$ when the medication, which is generic and very common, is supposed to be FREE under our insurance. This is blatant theft by deception. My husband did not know how much it should cost and just paid what they said.  When I questioned them a couple days later, because the amount did not match any of our copayments, they told us to bring the receipt back in the store and they would give us a refund.  But we can't because we already threw away the paperwork. Why should we need to bring in the receipt, they obviously have the purchase record in their system?  The worst part is they did this trick to us 2 months in a row, and would have continued if I had not questioned why we were being charged so much for a very common and cheap medication.  Moral of the story is be very careful at the pharmacy as they will rip you off if you don't pay close attention to what you are being charged."

uZpt2ft8IsG-fAyFWhNChA,WDyx7-SsE6Aafqa0cZV-Ig,"I learned about this shop through a family friend. My boyfriend and I had just bought a car, and we needed a place for it to get smogged. 

We live in Silverado Ranch so it is a bit of a drive, but well worth it! It passed and we got it registered at the DMV.

A couple weeks later I noticed it started blowing hot air out the A/C. I called them for pricing, and although they didn't give me pricing (number of things could be wrong with the A/C!) I decided to drive down there anyway, since they treated us well last time!

Upon arrival, I told the guy, Bill I believe was his name, that I had called earlier and he said, ""Oh yeah I remember you. The thing is, that kind of stuff you usually have to set an appointment. We're really busy today. but let me see if [so-and-so] can at least take a look."" 

The mechanic pulled in my car and started at it!

He put freon into the car, and also put a tracer dye so if/when it leaks out, they'll know where the leak is so it'll be easier/faster to fix! They also explained that A/Cs are a sealed system so when it does blow warm/hot air, it's got a hole/leak. I'm a girl that doesn't know much about cars, so it was nice for the small educational lesson!

I got to talking with the guys, and they said themselves: usually a small town shop like this will be up front and honest, because for the most part, their clients are local people they'll see everyday at the grocery store or school game and they wouldn't want a bad rep!

It took about 20 minutes all together and I was set...FOR BEING A WALK-IN! They are awesome guys there!

I HIGHLY recommend this shop, as you never know who to trust and who is is gonna rape you for hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars, especially if you're a woman that doesn't know squat about cars!

Unfortunately my car is blowing warm air again, but that means it has a leak somewhere, so I'm going to call them today to set up an appointment...don't wanna die in this Vegas heat!!

It can be a long drive to K.C.'s depending where you live, but I can assure you, you'll know you'll be treated fairly and won't have to worry about getting ripped off like 9/10 of shops out here in Vegas."

There are a lot of activities for kids and teens for a smallish sized church (about 300). They have Missions outreach, Drama team, and mens and womens groups as well. The worship and teaching is Bible based without flip floppy comprimise. 

Their motto is that Meadows is a safe place to hear a dangerous message and it is exactly that! I now go every week!

The new location is a bit farther away from the center of town, but the store itself is probably four times the size and much better organized.

The beauty of Pages is that it is a locally owned bookstore with the stock of a corporate one.  It feels good to support local businesses and Pages lets you do just that without having to sacrifice selection.

They have most any book you could go out searching for and if they don't have it in house, they will gladly order it for you in about the same time it would take Borders or Barnes & Noble to.

Additionally, Pages offers a neat frequent-buyers club that gives you discounts on your tenth book purchased and on any total order during your birthday month.  I've saved up my discount many a time to take the edge off of some of my pricier lustings.  And anyway, aren't there worse things to be spending my cash on than good reading material?

In the time it takes you to head north on Prospect to reach a corporate book mall, you can head south instead and feel good about where your beloved books are coming from.

P.S. check out the bookclubs and featured author readings that are happening just about every weekend."
iqx8VckOhO7nict32SPjKg,4QpG-4yNtrE9h1907RwBIA,"I went here as a referral from a friend who has natural, non-relaxed African- American hair. I did not think Great Clips serviced kinky curly hair types but was pleasantly surprised when she told me she had a good experience there recently when one of the stylists who services ethnic customers had flat ironed her hair. I decided to trust her and go there myself. I have very curly kinky ""bi-racial"" type hair, probably curlier than hers. As soon as I walked in it felt like the record scratched. When I said I wanted a shampoo and flat iron the very nice hostess slightly winced and asked what time the stylist I requested was scheduled to get off. Bad sign. I stayed and she amused me a little and took my information and told me to have a seat. In about 30 seconds, someone who appeared to be management came from the back and asked me, again, what I needed done. She said if she flat ironed my hair it wouldn't be straight. Interesting because my hair has been flat ironed several times and it has been just that, very straight. They also told me it would take 2 hours and they would need extra staff since I would take so long. After much convincing from the entire staff that I would be unhappy with the results, I decided to stop trying to convince them to do my hair and I finally got the hint..""please leave lady with kinky hair, you're way too much work for us"". I write this to save all of the ""ethnic"" women with kinky curly hair from wasting their time. Just stick to salons that are comfortable servicing us and don't make you feel like a big unruly nappy mess they don't want to tackle."

The butter chicken had 5 very small pieces of chicken and the rest is all (tasty) sauce. If you added up all the chicken it might equal half a chicken breast but not even. I also got two gulab jamun and they were great. The place is new and maybe they are still figuring things out so I don't want to write them off just yet. Maybe I got unlucky with my portion size. I hope the owners can read this and hopefully improve because I would love to see them do well. Again, the food is great you just don't get much."

When I went in I was told that they director had abruptly resigned and my appointment would need to be rescheduled.  No apology was offered.  None of the staff looked very happy and while I understand that places do go through unexpected transitions, it did not appear to be very well organized.  On a sadder note, one of the toddlers was crying from the time I arrived to the time I left and no one attempted to comfort her.  Definitely not the place I would choose."

Y73eFkZWlv6JZdIcSaiuEQ,f9lq4KAus-xCsmJmjXeKVw,"I stayed in Quality Inn recently and it's not bad. I was under the impression that it was a hotel but it is actually more of a motel. It is quiet, private and comfortable.  It is actually an older building that has been renovated. 

The room was nice 2 beds, a tv and a bathroom. It was clean and nicely renovated. They also have an indoor swimming pool and hot tub that are surrounded and overlooked by the guest rooms. They offer free breakfast from 6am-9pm which is OK, I didn't expect it to be anything special so I wasn't disappointed. They have a Thai restaurant inside where I ordered soup from one night and it wasn't bad. The restaurant has a patio type window that looks out at the pool so it's kind of a nice setting. They also offer free wireless internet. 

Not the best place but it was good for a short stay. I imagine it gets many guests that are on business trips."

$45 for a manicure with a dirty, worn out  nail file. When I asked the manicurist if she could use a better file, she told me that ""they"" (I am assuming the owners) dont provide them so she had to use her own and thats all she had. The nail polish was applied sloppily and started to chip before I had even pay.  All that being said my sister did liked her massage.

They have moved to a new location from 16th ave to 37 ave NE. There are a lot of spas in Calgary that provide excellent service so I don't feel the need to go back."

8BgufTquUG2G5ZRddInrTA,d4KYbDVLX8eMNCkw4YrBhg,"This is the worst business establishment that I have ever encountered. I have had 2 encounters with this store and actually was in awe of the inadequacy. Yes, I had the same thing happen to me as the other reviewer. 

I knew exactly what I wanted when I arrived b.c. had been advised by another radio shack... and Sprint...

My 1st visit was after working with radio shack in mission viejo ca (Great Store)... I walked into the LV West location and was ignored. After being at the counter for over 5 minutes the guy looked up and said what do you need? I told him I wanted a device for a hotspot... he replied dial 611 and walked away. 

The 2nd visit was after calling 611 but still wanting the device to create a faster service. I walked back in with a greater anticipation that I would just grab what I had needed to begin with. The guy who looking rather shady looked at me and actually said... ""I don't know what that is, I have never heard of it."" I am not kidding. I said, well I was told that you have them"". The punk replied, ""who said that?"" Well every other radio shack that I spoke to"" I replied.  I walked out. 

I don't know what is going on in there but I would recommend that any decent human being that is looking for anything resembling customer service, a normal vocabulary or even someone who actually understands the kind of business they are working within...should most definitely seek out another business."

WKT74DNPEzW9PgiLbHGIew,ixlfjZ2FVHHgZGcHAbDP6A,"I visited this spa at the end of December 2010, but have just recently discovered the awesomeness that is yelp. I remembered the bad experience I had and the review I wrote on google, and I wanted to re-post my review on yelp to let the community know my experience at this spa because they post on coupon sites frequently. 

What an awful experience. I bought a voucher on dealfind for $50 that included 45 minute massage, mani, pedi, and eye brow threading. My appointment started half an hour late. The massage was not bad, but it was only 30 minutes and my hair and face got covered in massage oil. She insisted on doing the manicure in the same room as the massage, and insisted that I lie down while she did the manicure. She put a towel on my sweater and used my stomach as the ""manicure table"". There was only one lamp in the room, and it was flickering and shining right in my face. I looked at my nails after she finished two coats of nail polish and the skin around my nails was covered in polish. She was going to try to clean them up using a pad with polish remover, but I decided to end the appointment and asked her to remove the polish and then left without getting the pedi or eye brow threading. Not willing to risk my eye brows at a place like this. I can't imagine getting laser or microdermabrasion done here. Dealfind / groupon / teambuy / etc buyer beware. Unfortunately there is no chance of a refund for poor service when paying through these companies.

This spa is the reason I will never buy an online coupon for a place I have never been before."

Jimmy is always available by phone/text/email and always promptly addresses every one of our concerns or needs.

Lisa helped us with so many areas including setting up my breastfeeding pump, bath time, developmental activities, breastfeeding education and tips (and encouragement!), giving me a break if I needed a little extra rest, and any other questions we had. She is not only extremely knowledgeable, practical in her approach, and available for questions, but she also has a great personality and makes you feel at ease during a time of huge transition. It was wonderful to have her as a resource as we became comfortable with our newborn and his needs and we would wholeheartedly recommend her services to anyone expecting a baby!"

Typically have three different people cut my hair and I am normally pretty happy with the cut. This time the stylist didn't take mirror to show me the back and sides. That's unusual. When I got home my wife told me my hair looked funny. I get a #2 on the side and scissor cut on top. The stylist did blend the top to the sides very well and it has an about transions. Worst cut from this location. Will go somewhere else to have it fixed. One bad cut over couple years I have been going there. I guess I do need to make sure of which stylist cuts my hair.

The fries were pricey - 4.99.  They were delicious, although they were jullienne - NOT pub style chips.

They were out of the Blarney's Gold beer, so the second choice was offered at Blarney's Gold price.  All in all, it would have been a really great weeknight out, but the clientele and barman were a little rough around the edges, to say the least - discussing their difficulties in getting into the US on account of ""one f*ckin DUI"".

They have a decent selection of Indian staples (atta, for one ... ever tried making rotis with generic supermarket ""wholewheat flour""?), hard-to-find South Indian specialties, and, best of all in my opinion, some excellent frozen packaged foods.

My Dyson machine broke and I took it to White Vacuum Co. John looked it over and told me what needed to be done for the repair. He gave me an estimate for the cost.
Instead of repairing it, I decided to invest in a new vacuum cleaner- (this machine was 8 years old).  Originally, I thought I could buy a cheaper model from Craigslist, but John advised me what to look for when buying a vacuum cleaner from an individual ""off the street"".
I really appreciated his concern and decided to purchase my new machine from him at White Vacuum Company.
During my shopping experience there, he took a lot of time with me, making sure I got the vacuum I liked and even gave me a good deal on the machine-(a New Dyson!)
I trust him and the folks there, and will only go to them for my vacuum repairs and purchases in the future.
Highly recommended merchant!

The crowd on the dance floor was as mixed as the music they played - 70s, 80s, 90s, hip hop and top 40s. The bar  also offers a pool table where you'd also get an occasional dance up from the players and tables and chairs in the back to put your stuff down or to take a break. It's dated, divey and drinks were flowin because they were cheap. Thanks Paul for being born and having a reason to celebrate! We will definitely be back!"

The camera department leaves a lot to be desired.  Dealt with Terry and he didn't know what he was talking about.  He gave me wrong information and was clueless about cameras and a bit rude.

Bought a printer the other day.  The guy who helped me was alright but again, aside from the basics that the average joe knows, not very knowledgeable about the differences between printers."
hL6imrnIayfMrtNXCfolJA,92JnIJzulfMO-H98IbST7A,"I was looking for a temporary place to send our mail while we moved from Denver to Vegas.  After reading the reviews about the local Post Office service around here losing packages and horrific customer service I knew I wouldn't be happy renting a box there.  

The entire set up process here took less than five minutes, including waiting for the man in front of me to take care of his package pickup.   Just needed to show two forms of ID and sign in three places. 

I like the fact that they give you a key to the front door for 24 hour access and you get a true street address...not just a P.O. number.  They also sign for packages for you and notify you by email. The worker there was courteous and efficient.  Wasn't forced to enter any monthly contracts either, which is great because I will only be needing it for a short time.  

I can't comment on the reliability yet, as I haven't even used it, but it seems like a pretty straightforward biz with no hassles so far."

He knew what I was looking for and zeroed in on the perfect condo. He met every criteria I listed when searching for my new home. I'm new to Las Vegas and he knew exactly where to look and what I could afford. I got everything I wanted!!!! Great location, great price and every amenity I asked for. I've never been so happy with a property purchase.  He really came through. He also took the time to educate me on Las Vegas. He showed me many locations in Las Vegas educating me on the history. He didn't;'t have to do this, but he took the time to do it. A very positive experience. He had something positive to say about every neiborhood. He really knows his town! I feel very fortunate to have moved to Las Vegas and to go through Steve. I would highly recommend Steve for any type of real estate purchase. Great, great experience!!!!!!"
TO7ppWaIISUYzqxD5cs-Og,IRlZ6-ZCcSsPGOFekAxB1w,"I started attending in November, 2011 and no doubt, it's the best gym I've ever been to.

First off, the Trainers, Patrick and Stacy are very knowledgable and are always looking out to make sure you are doing things safely. That said, they will push you, too. 

The workouts are always varying, so there is little chance that you can ever plateau. Everyone that belongs to the gym is very friendly - Not what you'd expect from a typical 'gym'. 

Finally, Great Lakes CrossFit HAS to be the cleanest gym you'll attend. Come check it out, you will not be disappointed."
9HU9xV2iZbtJRH5WT6ZtHw,nxXYYAkjrmsDP00aGOd3zQ,"Bought tires from here about a year ago I'm now just sitting down to write this review sorry for that delay.  The price on the tires were pretty good ,competitive with other places that's why I came here.   I was there almost 3 hours just to have four tires put on     Then of course when they're done with the tires they try and rip you off and tell you you need all kinds of other work.    My car at the time I believe had around 23,000 miles on it give or take a little, The reason it needed new tires at that low mileage is more because of the age ,original tires on a 2003.   well they told me I needed new brakes I said what are you crazy the car only has 20 some thousand miles on it.   And of course they would not physically show me that the brakes were bad. I guess I had to take their word for it.    Well anyway I did not get the brakes to this day now the car has 37,000 miles on it and their brakes are still fine had them checked at the dealer when I got the oil change they said they were in good shape.  So just be careful when you get tires there that they don't try and rip you off and say other things are wrong I would definitely get another opinion  and if they say something is wrong have them show you.   Just some sound advice. This place will definitely try and rip you off if you're not careful.   But the prices are my tires and pretty good that's how they get you in.   I like the tires and the price otherwise it would've been one star instead of two."

On September 18 2015 I put in a maintenance request for a leaking toilet at approximately 1:30. At about 3:00 pm I left my apartment and left my MacBook Pro on my bed in my room. When I returned to my apartment the doors were locked the way I left them with no signs of forced entry. There was a note from the maintence staff saying they had come to my apartment to inspect the toilet and would return the next day for repair. The next morning I realized my mac book pro was no where in my apartment. I immediately notified the staff and was told the manager would be notified. Today, a month later after numerous attempts for answers, the district manager finally reached out to me. To tell me I have no proof that anyone from their staff stole my laptop and that I still need to continue to pay to live there or pay per terms of my lease agreement to end it, because they are not at fault in this situation. So please be aware."

Did the hem job on all 3 with the same colour thread. So nice light grey pants with a nasty dark sticking showing through on the finished side. Stitching was quite obvious on all the pants hemmed and didn't look professional at all. 

I respectfully asked for a refund and the owner vehemently refused and offered to redo them. I expressed concern that the job wasn't done right the first time so I wasn't confident that it would be done properly the second. Again complete refusal to listen to me, address my concerns as a customer, etc.

I went here because they were closer than other tailors I had used previously but I'll never go back and will happily drive further to get quality work and service somewhere else."

Finally at the 4 hour mark he says he's finished and proceeds to tell me they normally wouldn't fix the phone cause of a bent frame but he went ahead and did it anyway an that the glass was just a little off and put pressure on my home button but the phone was functioning and ok I just had to press a little hard on the home button.. BUT in fact the home button was NOT functional at all and well I come back a day later to ask if they would help me out on getting new glass for the replacement phone I got since they didn't do it right and it shouldn't have been fixed in the first place... Only to them saying there's nothing they can do to help me other than charge me another 95$ for new glass again the day after they serviced my phone so feeling like I'm partially at fault for it not working I simply ask for a discount or some kinda of help out on fixing it again cause it shouldn't have been fixed in the first place and now I have one that will work and there's nothing they can do to help me they want full price on new glass and installation... I even offered to pay for new glass if they could just help me out and waive installation fee... I'm not asking for it to be free for fuck sake just help out cause u admitted u shouldn't have done the work in the first place.., only to have them tell me there's nothing they can do but charge me full price and have it done sooner this time...

I have been in other bird stores around the area before, but as soon as I stepped into this store I could tell it was exceptional - a small, pleasant, clean and organized environment with such helpful and friendly staff! As soon as I walked in I was greeted by an array of cute, healthy, cheerful parrots in especially well kept cages. Of course, I was also greeted by Martha who kindly introduced me around the store and answered any questions I had. She even offered to help my little sister and I hold the baby birds who were currently still being hand fed. Her love of birds is clearly visible in how she treats and talks about them! She is such a kindhearted, pleasant person and I enjoy coming by and chatting with her about the birds. :) I have also met the new store owner and I have to say that she is an extremely professional and delightful person! I am glad to have met her. :) I have just recently purchased a hand-fed baby parakeet from this store for my little sister and we are both completely thrilled with our new feathered friend! His bubbly personality is adorable and he willingly steps up on your finger to be held. My little sister is smitten with him and I give all the credit to Claudia's Bird Nest! The store also offers a large variety of quality toys, supplies, and food and provides grooming and boarding services at reasonable prices. I highly recommend this store for all your birdie needs or if you are looking to adopt a new feathered friend. This is my new favorite, number one stop for everything concerning my parrots, bar none. Support small businesses worth staying in business!!! :D"

My landlord first asked Blake from Peavler Cooling to call and follow up with me and set up an appointment to check the unit. Blake said he would call us back but  did not respond to our phone calls for 3 days and when he finally showed up without calling he said "" miracles do happen"" and laughed. He said the unit was running 7 degrees to warm and was going to check it. After 20 minutes on my roof working on something and when he came down said the unit was working fine and didn't do anything to it. He did not test the vent after he worked on it on the roof. After he was done he got into his truck without saying a word, just walked out and sat in his truck. When I asked him how old the unit was he stalled a said it's not new. I asked him the year and was silent. I asked him if it was the original and Blake said no.  So gave us no info and the unit is still running sluggish as before and doesn't cool properly.

I think he was covering for the landlord by telling me the unit is fine and not telling me the last time it was serviced so the landlord does not have to pay for a new one. ( he told me he has worked with our landlord for years.

After he avoided my questions he said very rudely "" I have to get to other customers that really need me that have 110 degree houses. Even though we were told it was his last call of the day.

YNYUrINEPY-Z7fgYeJOvvA,qLwq921gXfVx3pK2fyVatw,"Well, where do I start? This is my very first time writing a review on this site, and sadly it's a bad review.

In Riverbend, there is a paragon pharmacy, where one of their pharmacists is very nice ( he wears glasses), but the other one....I think he is of an east indian ethnic, and please note that this is not intended to be a racist review.

I went in for antibiotics prescription, and the pharmacist at that time gave me, somehow, the wrong amount of pills. I called in as soon as I noticed it and they asked me how many pills they were short of, and that I could go back as soon I as could, so I did. When I got there the other pharmacist was on duty ( the one with the glasses, he is supper friendly) but again I was given the wrong amount of pills. (everybody makes mistakes, so what?)

Another day I went in with my partner and he was looking for an over the counter product. The pharmacist who is not so nice was on duty that day, and when asked the question by my partner, he somehow refused to help us. We thought it was very strange, but didn't think of it any further.

Yesterday!!! I had oral surgery, so I went in for my prescriptions, and he told me that it would take them 2 hours. I politely responded that I was sorry, but I had just come out of surgery and I needed my meds as soon as possible, and that I couldn't wait two hours. He came back to me and almost ""threw"" my papers that I had given him at me, with a lot of attitude saying that they were busy. At that time I asked him, again, politely, where I could find another pharmacy...which he, again with attitude, said "" I don't know"" and WALKED AWAY FROM ME!  I was astonished."

I bought the ink and a few months later, tried putting it in my HP printer. The printer read ""ink expired"" and wouldn't accept it. Then the guy at the store tried to convince me that it's impossible for a printer to know if ink is expired. Ironic that he's running a tech store but clearly doesn't understand technology.

The label on the box of ink read ""use before"" and had a date underneath it. The date had already passed when they sold me the ink, and I had the receipt to prove it. And then the guy tried to convince me that it was just a barcode, not a date. Why would a barcode have a ""use before"" date? Does a barcode expire? Lol, what a joke.

UPDATE March 2012... not sure why my review was filtered. But I'm very glad to see that others have written about their problems with this shady place.

Getting there is a challenge:  work on Lear Road requires you to take a tour just to get to the building.
Parking is a disaster:  Unfilled handicapped parking and everyone else walks a mile. Yes, I could use the valet, but why?  Only to keep insurance costs skyrocketing by building it into overhead.
Signage:  count on it to head you in the wrong direction
Scheduling:  Don't bother calling.  You will be placed on hold, transferred to the wrong place and given incorrect information.  Appointments are backed up without any wiggle-room for emergencies.
Staff:  abysmal.  They don't care, and give you a rehearsed response in a monotone voice when providing ""answers"".  Typically, they are vague.

I just hosted an end-of-school-year party for my son's 5th grade classroom at our home.  We have a pool, but I wanted an added element of fun so we looked into renting a water slide.

This company was awesome, in my opinion, to work with.  They arrived on time, both for delivery and pickup.  They were helpful and friendly on the phone and for delivery and I can't imagine anyone I spoke to having the personality to call anyone nasty names.   They were quite reasonable in price and as a matter of fact, matched a cheaper price I found and rented the water slide for a longer time frame.  I ask that you consider them at least as an option."
0PE0mno-0KlOeEqAYOkBXQ,SCmRXxw0Livi1qgt2SXRGA,Not to recommend. To expensive for what it is. You have to pay for 2 days also if you want only one day and the hours when the bus drives are very limited. Also with very nice weather it was not a tourist double deck bus bus a normal travel bus which limited view. At last the driver was not understandable in French or English and only tried to make some bad joke. I regretted  to choose this attraction.
bYwFgeFMyv0vdExEigm5tA,jdD9_VArj_7cPlALrqNH_Q,"I received a beautiful terrarium from Bloom over the holidays. Unfortunately, I had a few issues with it and the plants started wilting and browning, even though I was following the care instructions. On my first visit to Bloom, Paul replaced the plants. However, once home the plants began to turn and wilt again. I tried various locations within my apartment to remedy the situation but nothing seemed to turn the terrarium around. 

Upon learning of my complaint, Paul jumped into action and addressed the issue swiftly and with civility. He not only takes pride and responsibility in his product, he also cares about his customers and wants to make sure they leave with a smile on their face.

This is a small business that I would highly recommend to my family and friends, and to all Yelpers looking for a quaint local business to support."

Took vacuum in for our annual service and this is the second year in a row that they have lost it!!!  It's been three weeks since we dropped it off, without a call. So I called today to get an update and they claim they have no record of it being there even though we have the receipt. The incompetent worker there, James, claims that an employee probably put the wrong name on the tag and sent it home with a different person. Seriously, how hard is it to do your job!!!  For a vacuum that costs anywhere from $500 to $1000, you would think they could hire people that can function as a normal human being. Now we have company coming over tomorrow and nothing to vacuum the house with because James can't do his job, and claims he has to wait until Monday for his service guy to come in. 

Oreck vacuums are great and well worth the money, but I would avoid this Oreck store like the plague if I were you. They have two days to find my vacuum or replace it free of charge, or I will be calling corporate and filing a small suit claim. And being a lawyer myself, not going to be an issue."

bmQoA1Y84sdymymsRuhwhg,dFbiBPZ0GcBB2WsODeDrkw,"I was left generally unimpressed by the service at this dentist office and have opted to go elsewhere. While the employees were friendly, the following caused me to change offices:
1) My appointments always started late- anywhere between 35-50 minutes late. My time is valuable too.
2) The cleaning I had was the *most painful* cleaning I've ever had. At one point, as I white-knuckled the chair, the hygienist asked if she should stop. I said no- just wanting to get it over with- and she replied ""You're doing really well! Most people need a break!"" Not exactly a confidence-booster.
3) Being asked, ""So, what are we doing today?"" when I sat down. Again, being asked this- as if it was a top-and-sides haircut- didn't build my confidence.
4) A ridiculous number of phone calls hassling me to come in for check-ups. I didn't appreciate being told when I'd been scheduled to come in, without first asking me if I was available for the scheduled times. I found it borderline disrespectful for them to assume I could drop everything to make it in.

As I said, I  thought the staff were friendly, but everyone I've spoke to about my experiences says that it's unlike anything they've experienced at their own dentist.  I've been told that it pays to shop around for a dentist you like (or rather, don't dislike), so this is what I'm going to do."

I contacted several companies based on similar reviews & suggestions. However, these guys sounded professional & aware of the job requirements. They gave me an estimate of 3 hours & actually finished unloading in only 75 minutes. I asked them to help me with assembling a couple of items since their minimum charge is 2 hours & they were done in the remaining 45 minutes.

They're polite, quite & don't waste time taking breaks. They're also prompt & take care of the items they're handling. They may not be the cheapest in the market but then again quality has a price.

First meal was fried walleye.  Tough to go wrong with deep fried anything, right?  Wrong.  It seemed like the oil wasn't hot enough because the breading was like a grease-filled sponge.  All served up on chopped iceberg lettuce?  Weird.

Honestly can't remember the second meal.  But the kids ordered pancakes that were burnt on one side and dry.

Third meal was some breakfast skillet.  Menu item specifically mentioned breakfast sausage.  When I received my skillet, there was no meat.  Told my waitress.  We looked through the skillet together to find meat.  We failed.  She went to ask the cook what the deal was.  The cook assured her that the meat was mixed in with the gravy.  Fail.

Three strikes and you're out.

Have to agree with other review.  Huge menu full of mediocrity at best, crap at worst.

Now when I drive by I just shake my head and pray they'll go out of business so we have a chance a getting a better place in Monticello."

Very good customer service here - all the workers are friendly, I was offered water or tea before I started. The lady who did my nails ensured everything she did was what I wanted. They also have a very good selection of nail polish and they're all neatly aligned by colour shade. 

I got bio gel and it was very well done - and only $50. I'm used to downtown prices so that's a good price for me.

Bonus: All nail stations face a giant flat screen TV with CP24 news on - so it definitely helped entertaining me while waiting for my nails to finish.

My dad found that he could fix the situation and called in to cancel my tow service. The company was gracious about it and Ben was too.

She says that my dogs were &quot;being goobers and rough-housing the other day&quot;. My dogs have lived together for 6 years, they do not hurt each other when they rough house. It was Gin who had the scratch and it appears to look like the skin under her eye was caught on the fence and drug down. Because it happened more than 24 hours ago, she cannot have stitches or have it glued back together. So now, my beautiful dogs is going to have a skin flap scar on her face. Very upset.

zu0dRWFf6cDkGmO8BjPvHg,oaYB_b62fqtJCbeKFWg8Sg,"While it's been nearly two years since I left O'Neil Towers, I was prompted to write this review by a nightmare I had the other night... a nightmare in which I was forced to move back into this building (for real!).

When I arrived in Calgary I didn't know where in the city I would be working, and I was using public transit, so I thought living downtown near the C-Train line would be best.  My logic was sound, and I'm glad I didn't move to the far southeast (as I ended up working in the far northwest)... but I wish I hadn't chosen this apartment building.  

The building itself is not in good condition.  The elevators frequently don't work, and the fire alarms go off ALL THE TIME (usually at 4:00 am, and mostly when the weather dips below -20!).  Many of the Boardwalk staff will blame it on people burning food, but one Boardwalk employee AND numerous firefighters responding to the alarms told me that it was because the building's heating and pipe systems were faulty (on firefighter told me that freezing water in the pipes deactivates the sprinklers, which sets off the fire alarm as a precaution).  The laundry room is dirty (and lots of yucky people leave their laundry sitting in machines for hours on end, making it difficult to do your own loads).  The parkade (I think parking is $100ish per month?) is not particularly secure, and the back entry to the building is frequently occupied by drug users and dealers.

My suite (a corner suite on a floor near the middle of the building, costing $1219 monthly) was not particularly clean when I moved in, despite the fact that I moved in two weeks after my lease began (giving them plenty of time to properly clean the carpets- something they bill you for when you leave).  Noise from the neighboring suites was an issue.  Maintenance was a pretty significant concern- my toilet broke once, and my shower leaked almost non-stop for several months (despite my submitting regular maintenance requests).  Maintenance workers were friendly but always left their work areas dirty (and not actually repaired!).  You also have to be prepared to take a serious hit on your electric bill- Boardwalk deals with a private electric company (in which they have a financial stake) that charges extremely high ""service charges"".  These ""service charges"" vastly exceeded the actual cost of my energy use every month- sometimes two- or three-fold.  

I ended up moving out three months early, as I could no longer take the late-night fire evacuations and leaky shower.  Because I ""broke the lease"", Boardwalk kept my entire damage despite.  They're a crappy company and it's a crappy building... don't even consider this apartment building!"

They said they sprayed them, which was untrue because the weeds never went away. This company offers low quality work coupled with poor customer service."

However, the 2nd time I went there to shop, the young dude seemed hyper and stressed out - he went off on me unexpectedly for no reason whatsoever.  It was very strange - kinda creepy in a bi-polar type of way.  I said nothing at all - just made payment and wanted the heck out of there.  Then the clerk sort of realized that he was a jerk and tried to make nice and thanked me for shopping there......No, thanks, buddy.. sorry,  but won't go anywhere near that place again!!#!"

The chances of him ever getting on a treadmill are slim and none. I have seen him go from working out 4 times a week for years and then stop when he can't find an instructor he likes. My husband being heavy I worry about his health. I am so happy he found this place. From the day he walked in there and over the past four months I have seen the dedication and enjoyment in his face when he comes back from working out I have also seen him disappointed with many other instructors and schools. Since the day he joined he's been practicing for 4 to 6 times a week taking Jiu-Jitsu & Muay Thai and it's obvious he's back to his old self. He is now training hard losing weight and feeling better every day. Before this I have seen him be demotivated and and go through instructor after instructor due to their lack of ability to connect or keep him interested. This school is the place to be, they are  motivational , instructional and they really care about their clients .I'm so happy to see my husband so excited about getting into shape again. I highly recommend this school"

D_ZZOi73Kp_fy8y5DFJG5Q,__EiNz1SgzuOYd1dQ28E3g,"We used to order from here at least once a week at work. For the past few times they have gone completely down hill. Previous order; food and drinks were forgotten about. When we called to let them know, and asked if they could have someone deliver it we got ""Well we're really busy right now"" as a response. Rude. This time, we ordered before the lunch rush could even start, (11:38) and over AN HOUR LATER WE had to call THEM and ask what was happening? 
Same response ""We're very busy, be patient"" - We received our food an hour and half after calling, and food was cold. We ordered very simple things to make. Lettuce on the chicken burger was wilted and browning. 
Will not be ordering from them again, that is for sure. 2M has the same menu items, and A LOT better service."
Wq0cWwBkapXOUP5QPV034Q,fshLW072hSigFSLW2fKJEw,"I'm giving this joint one star only because I cannot give it zero.  Since they have been open I have visited this restaurant twice.  The first time, I had a pretty awful experience on the first night of their ""soft opening"".  I wouldn't consider counting it against them as Chef Leonard clearly did not have it together at that point.  Totally forgivable.

It is not that initial experience on which I base my rating, and this review.  

My father has visited Vinery 214/Bambino Bistro on a semi-frequent basis, and he has nothing but complaints about the service.  He gets a laugh out of it and has been wiling to give Leonard a chance time and again.  When he suggested we go for lunch earlier today, I played along, as it is close to where I live and I was hungry.

We ordered inside, two paninis and two iced teas, and grabbed a table on the small patio, which has to be one of the best outdoor dining areas in downtown phoenix.  Our food was out in less than fifteen minutes, as promised.  Leonard had to go back inside for our iced teas, which was a minor inconvenience that I am willing to forgive.  He had to go back again to get us the napkins we asked for.  Before picking up my oil-soaked panini sandwich I waited while he rolled two linens with silverware and casually chatted with the other cook inside.  By the time we were all prepped to eat, I had done enough staring at my sandwich to lose my appetite.

I ordered the panini with mozzarella, basil pesto and garlic aoli.  What I got was nothing of the sort.  There was certainly basil pesto, fresh greens, tomato and balsamic vinegar but the cheese appeared to be a blend of cheddar, what tasted like jack and maybe mozzarella.  I ate half the sandwich anyway and it was horrible.  When ""Celebrity Chef Leonard Jay"" came out to ask us about our meal, I told him it was not satisfactory, nor what I ordered.  

I complained about the cheese not being mozzarella and he made some big spiel about ""quattro formaggi"" that he uses on everything.  He seemed totally disinterested in my complaint about the meal not being what I ordered (one would expect a mozzarella panini to have some sliced mozzarella on it, no?).  Leonard even had the audacity to bring me a cup of his special shredded cheese mix and openly challenge my criticism of his food.  He took my critique of his food personally, which is understandable for anyone who takes pride in their work.  However, I do not believe he is making quality product and he needs to know that.

If I had sat around any longer, I would have completely lost my cool on this guy.  The man's ego exceeds not only his culinary abilities but also his prowess as a restauranteur.  ""Celebrity Chef"" Leonard Jay is a joke.  Anyone wiling to treat their customers like I was treated in his restaurant should not be in this business.

No matter how difficult a customer is with me when I am serving them I always swallow my pride and concede any sort of argument.  I work in the service industry and it is my personal goal to never lose a customer when I can do something about it.  That is why it is called the ""service industry"".

I will never return to this establishment as long as Leonard Jay is in charge.  This place is a prime spot and, when Bambino Bistro finally comes to its impending end, I hope the next person to open a restaurant there does a much better job.  The place is already set up for what could be an excellent little downtown cafe.  I am certainly looking forward to it."

I came to the appointment where all of a sudden, it was over 80 dollars because they told me the car required full synthetic oil. I told them that it didn't sound right and they said I could get the blend but it isn't recommend and was over 40 dollars. I spoke to a friend who looked up my owners manual. According to the manual, the car does not require any type of synthetic oil. I then called the Chevy dealership. They told me the same thing. They said they only put the blend in, never full synthetic and that the car doesn't require even the blend. While I was waiting a man came in because after his oil change, his car is completely out of alignment. They were completely dissmissive and unwilling to help him. They said, they didn't do an alignment so it's not their fault. Then they offered him am appointment to get an alignment for 95 dollars. This place seems like a huge scam.

I have taken Rancho to court to collect my deposit refund (she refused to do a move-out property inspection), did not keep property in good repair during my tenancy (repaired items under warranty so I had to pay service charge) and tried 55 days after my move to deduct from my deposit for repairs for the next tenant (absolute and clearly discrimination - age, gender, or racial - why  didn't she inspect the property or repair any of the items on my 1.5 page inspection list before my move in? she did not even pay for pest control, a clear violation of NV law to rent a pest infected domicile).  My case was filed in Nov. 2016, and her lawyer, J WENDLAND, has not even mentioned a single 'law' in dealing with me, which leads me to suspect that either he knows about the guilt of Lori Walters or he knows no applicable Nevada law. At any rate, Lori Walters  has said nothing about resolving this case. Are both Lori and her lawyer trying to stall a settlement until my case expires in Nov 2017?  IS IT A SHAME THAT SHE CAN KEEP MONEY FROM ME (OR YOU OR OTHER TENANTS) TO PAY HER ATTORNEY TO REPRESENT HER? Her attorney uses bullying tactics to get me to agree to reduced settlement amount, accusing me of wanting 'excessive damages' for Lori Walters' failures as a property manager."
shoSMZu0vDoiBfTn1MmlxQ,NJVAx6rBKOjkiNQNUK_iFg,"I can't recommend this store to anyone. I have been wearing glasses/contact lenses for 20+ years and coming here was by far the most frustrating and terrible experience I have ever had. 

The optometrist I saw for my eye exam had no idea what he was doing. A routine eye exam was done and when I indicated I could not see the letters on the screen, he was actually helping me guess what they were. Really? This of course led to me being given a prescription for sample contact lenses which was completely wrong. When I called to discuss my options, I was told that I needed to have a second exam. Of course I didn't want to see that optometrist again, however I was told that if I wanted to see another (hopefully better) doctor, I would have to pay again. Alternatively I could see the same doctor again. Less than idea, but ok fine. At this point I scheduled my re visit, was given a second exam, and the prescription was revised. I then proceeded to have the store order me a second sample of contact lenses. These came in and are essentially non-wearable, due to a second incorrect prescription along with significant fit issues. 

Luckily by then I came to my senses and decided to cut my losses and go to a private and reputable optometrist clinic. When I arrived for my appointment, I was told that the prescription I had received from Hakim Optical was for glasses, not for contact lenses (funny, as they had no problem ordering contact lenses based on the prescription I was given). This was especially infuriating because I had told the optometrist at Hakim Optical several times that I needed new contact lenses, NOT new glasses. Unfortunately, I can't say the news was surprising considering the prescription and fit issues I was having. 

Basically, this place employs inferior optometrists who are not even capable of performing a basic exam. Second, the customer service in the store is sorely lacking (I have to pay for a new exam when your doctor messed up the first one? really?). Finally, their ""knowledge"" is laughable, given that they ordered me contact lenses from a glasses prescription, and upon visiting a more reputable clinic, it was confirmed by a secretary that the prescription they gave me wasn't even appropriate for the type of eyewear I was requesting. 

I am now sad to report that I am out insurance money for the completely inadequate eye exam I received from this location (and for glasses/contact wearers, we all know how precious every dollar of benefits for visioncare are). Considering the terrible customer service I received when I tried to complain the first time, it is futile for me to try to get a refund for the terrible services I received. I can only warn others - SAVE YOUR MONEY, do not go to this location. It will cause you nothing but problems."

HLYrDKspXGJ47_UZjPb8Tg,yaORGbNqa4zkwSK1Y7Rc4A,"I'd be cautious with this agency. 

My first clue was they were playing Usher in the waiting room. 

I was referred to this agency for DBT from the hospital I was admitted to. The social worker at the hospital was told by the agency that they accept my insurance. My appointment was the day after my discharge. I show up and guess what? They tell me they don't accept my insurance and I have to pay 80.00 (should've only been five w/ my insurance). I know I should have just walked away, but anxiety froze me. They gave me a bunch of Mumbo jumbo about deductibles and the next time I come in I'll probably get a check for 80.00, the amount I paid. I tried to explain that I know my insurance very well and that I've never had a deductible for mental health benefits, I questioned if it were a deductible issue why only 80?, I questioned why the social worker was told my insurance would be accepted, etc. my questions were minimized or ignored and I was told to deep breathe and that everything will be okay. 

WELL the next day I called my insurance and they said all of that information about deductibles was false and that Lifeline pcs is not on my insurance panel. 

THEN! 

I met a friend in a partial hospitalization program who was discharged into a DBT program. A couple weeks later I checked in with her and she was telling me the agency she was referred too was being very shady about her insurance- telling her they accept it but charging her a sizable sum of money. I asked her if it were lifeline and she said yes. I told her my story and suggested she call her insurance and sure enough they told her lifeline isn't on her panel. 

So BEWARE. The owner will come in and start telling you stuff about hmos and deductibles and assure you it will work out when they may or may not know you're not really covered."

15_RC7c4aPYFU0MzqXjLjw,KdTD3hTGs5bpiEzZ1WD2tQ,"We had our December Wedding at Roses Run Country Club and we couldn't have pulled it off - in just three months - without the incredible customer service of event coordinator Meghan and chef Janet.
 
We live out of state but grew up in Kent. We wanted to hold our wedding and reception back home, and it was important to us to work with local vendors - not an easy feat when planning a party for nearly 200 from afar. But every step of the way, Meghan and Janet were flexible, patient and accommodating as we brainstormed ideas, made very specific requests and proposed last-minute changes.

The value for the money was fantastic!

Meghan was responsive, professional, friendly, creative and very easy to work with. Her entire focus was on ensuring that our day was exactly as we wanted it, and, with Meghan in charge, we never worried about whether our ceremony and reception would reflect us or whether our needs would be met. She put together a fantastic team, and our guests universally praised the service, the dГ©cor and, across the board, the food.

When we first met with Janet to discuss the menu, she said: ""I won't let you down."" She kept that promise - even though we didn't make it easy on her! We wanted a sit-down meal with four options for entrees. We also had guests with specific dietary restrictions and more than two dozen picky-eating kids attending. At every step, Janet adjusted. Both the food and presentation were wonderful.

Our only negative feedback has nothing to do with the service or staff. Rather, it has to do with the venue itself. RRCC is located in a great place and has really good space for events of all sizes. But we've watched over the years as the venue has suffered from a lack of upkeep, and that's unfortunate. The site would benefit greatly from a bit of TLC, including replacing the worn, outdated carpeting, fixing cracked windows, improving the locker rooms/staging area and updating the pub area generally. It also would benefit from clear signage from the parking lot to the banquet area so event-goers know how to get to the right place.

Despite some of those venue drawbacks, we had a great experience entirely because of Meghan and Janet."
EEAtafGPtPhwERoM3onXuw,Qcy-TCF3kd0GYkanUrTrNQ,"I have been going to this Chinese Restaurant for years. The food is amazing. I have only eaten inside of here once (it's super creepy) so I got take out every time. The food is amazing, but I am giving it a one star because the woman that runs the business is the rudest, most miserable woman I have ever met. I literally have never seen this woman smile. A recent experience with this woman turned me off from this place forever.

You would think that someone would be even the littlest bit courteous to a customer that they see literally every other week for the past ten years. Lost my business! Sorry lady, but that is what happens when you hate everything in your life."

nYifLyIcS9V1Yj2wm2OVsw,NJbOBm3Y76g4fqxX6rQHQg,"Food was decent, the service was the worst I have ever seen in Vegas. It took our waiter over 15 minutes to figure out how to split the bill between three different parties and then we discovered that the prices on our receipts were more than what was listed on the menus. The manager came over and explained that the menu had been recently changed, but the changes hadn't taken place in the system yet. Nice work idiots. 

On second thought, just skip the dining at the Luxor all together and walk the short distance to the MGM."

While the frame didn't have a hole in it when it was purchased, (as far as I know) he never once mentioned the condition of the car prior to purchasing it or the 3 other times he has ""fixed"" things since. Yet, he still denies the fact that it was sold in such bad condition (yes, because that much rust can form in the small amount of time). Moral of the story is that he sold a lemon to not only a loyal customer but also a teenager who is now out $5,000 and is driving around a very dangerous vehicle. Doesn't even deserve a 1 star rating in my book"

_BHcf1HPycBC2I1HaVsswg,nvBRyFdUZh0wfL808SyWyQ,"Pros. It is very clean and the prices are really good. They have lots of customers. 
Cons. Last week I had a hair cut, that I did not like at all, but was told this is what I asked and there is no time to fix it. It was heartbreaking to leave so sad from the hairdresser. Most of the time I am ok with the haircut, I do not ask for big styling. But after years of coming here, I felt they did not care for some minutes of fixing a bit something that I did not like. I think the lady that cut was perhaps busy or stressed or having a bad day? not sure what happened. But it only takes one bad experience, I am afraid to go back there and even my daughter does not want to go there anymore, because she says my hair looks horrible. So I am in the look for another place where they are more into customer satisfaction."

Simons cafe Eve has a sign that says 'No Tips, we are happy to serve you.' Progressive just like the people that own/run Simons. Staff are paid the same as the other staff in the store so they don't have to worry about tips. Service is efficient, professional and friendly. Service is equal and maybe even superior to service in any of Calgary's finest eateries & restaurants.

yqmq8qrdhWH7wFQIpb2DqQ,RMgQT4RH28_aIycZISlkgA,"I'm not a member.  I'm not Orthodox.  But this place is a 5/5. If you are considering popping in as a visitor, then I'm writing this review for you.

If, like me, you've never been to an Orthodox service before...then let me tell you it's weird.  I mean that in the best possible way.  

I expected that it would be more formal than the Lutheran services I'm used to... but it wasn't really.  Each time I've been there kids are strolling around greeting and hugging adults they know, the faithful are moving to and fro and doing whatever rituals the faithful do, Father Andre and his deacons/helpers (?) are performing the liturgy, and I'm standing next to a wall staring at what appears to be a Christian 'Hall of Fame' and praying along to what I'm hearing.  Then occasionally something happens and everyone is singing together, praying out loud together, or sitting together to listen to the homily.  It's exhilarating to experience everyone 'doing their own thing' yet simultaneously doing it in harmony or even in unity.  It's weird and awesome.

It doesn't matter how how out of place you think you will be or how out of place you feel when you get there-- you are not out of place.  You are in the right place.  Every time I've gone someone new introduces themselves, encourages me to eat food and drink coffee, answers questions I have about the service, asks me interested-but-not-intrusive questions about myself, and just basically makes me feel like they had been hoping all week to see or meet me that Sunday.  

If you go, you will have an experience to remember.  And share.  On Yelp..."
IlMfUXp2ajAjKED11R5XPg,uYNCizqX9r0pobxw5vpVdw,The pizza is decent but everytime I go in there they try to over charge me and I have to correct them. It's a little fishy since as soon as I point it out they quickly agree that I was right. Also they always have signage saying they have a pick up special for a 2 topping pizza for $8.99 but when I call and ask about the special they say it's no longer valid even though when I drive by it is clearly advertised on the main road. Very frustrating and will probably not go back.

Still haven't gone on my flight and the stupid lady on the phone named Katherine had nothing to say and had no information whatsoever on anything I asked.
  I understand the weather conditions is THE factor that allows the flight to proceed but that should have been made clear that flights would be canceled over and over again. 

I have made 6 attempts to reschedule a flight and only 2 apparently show up on file because their system refused to let me schedule a flight.  When I tried the last time, it didn't come up with my flight even existing because I can't book in October, (even though flights are schedule between May and October)

They listen to all of my crazy mom worries and NEVER make me feel like an idiot or talk down to me.  Dr. Ross is super caring and honestly one of the most humble people I have ever met in the medical field. I finally feel like we have a pediatrician that listens. He is very supportive of a more natural way of healing. He doesn't just turn to his prescription pad for every issue that comes up.  My son was really sick a while ago and it was (of course) over the weekend, when it is very hard to get a hold of anyone. I called the after hours number expecting to have to navigate through a maze of automated messages. After 2 rings Dr. Ross picked up the phone himself. I was completely shocked.

2j_zH030dgSUx2p3JtaD7w,441COeIgLNRX-Lq3wCicXA,"I'm almost afraid to write this review, for fear that it will cause my favorite Sunday restaurant to get crowded. Several months ago, I was looking for a restaurant for Sunday brunch that took reservations. I came across Taste, which is located in the Hilton on Frye Road. My friends and I went the next Sunday, and we are hooked. The decor is lovely and comfortable. You can order off the menu, or enjoy the breakfast buffet for 15 dollars. Eggs any style, breakfast meats, cereals, fruits, pastries...nice! The food is consistently delicious.
For me, however, the big draw is the service. Every server or manager that I had encountered(I've been there 8 or 10 times) has gone out of their way to make our experience special. One day, they were a bit crowded, and our regular table was taken. The manager apologized. We never feel rushed, often sitting there long past closing time. One of my favorite things: they know my name! Buffet is closing? They will bring you fresh food from the kitchen. I love this place!"

O5WlH5h7LT03iWz6fqUb9A,BZEcbJvVJUc4rM1CZB1Cog,"I was looking for an old fashioned barber shop, like I used to go to when I was a young man.  I saw the video for Spring Valley Barber Shop on line and this seemed exactly what I was looking for.  I was more than happy to drive across town to get me an old fashioned haircut. 

But, when I arrived I was welcomed by a complete opposite of what I saw on line.  It was on a Wednesday afternoon at 2:00 in the afternoon.  What I was greeted by was not even close to what I was expecting.  Neither barber said hello or acted friendly at all.  There must have been 8 or 10 young Hispanic teenage age guys just laying around, loud music playing and this was not the type of shop that I, as an senior citizen feels comfortable in.
 
So, I will not be returning to Spring Valley Barber Shop.  My neighbor and I both have been looking for a great old fashioned barbershop to go get a great haircut and some guy conversation.  Totally sad.  I guess this isn't a place where seniors are welcome.  

Again, this makes me very sad to see how us seniors unwelcome some places.  So, if your not a young man don't bother going to this shop period.

SAD!!!!!!!!!!!"

raPS4HQiG5CbNgiLVPgdnw,VSCYw_I3bPD8z893KmmYdA,"I see Dr. Caroline Ruppert at Heartland Family Chiropractor. I would recommend her to everyone. I have never seen a chiropractor before and we are always leery of the unknown in life. However, when I went in for my first patient exam and went over everything with Dr. Caroline, I felt comfortable and she has been amazing with the help she has provided me. I fell down a flight of stairs and have a neck and shoulder issues. In the few months that I have seen her, I have felt better than anything else that I have tried. The best thing about seeing Dr. Caroline is that you can tell she cares about you as a patient, you aren't just a number or another person. She will go over anything you have questions on, she wants you to understand what she is doing and if you are not comfortable, she will fix it. Dr. Caroline is very easy going and honest. Her office staff is great as well. They are very welcoming and have great customer service. Keep up the good work!"

I was a mess when I first went to Colleen. Her approach is very holistic yet professional; she takes the time to really get to know you and carefully evaluates your issues. Colleen has given me many helpful tips on body mechanics for posture and how to avoid injury, which has really made a huge impact on the way I exercise. This shows she really cares about her clients. I am lucky she is not very far away and I can use her services again soon! Thank you!

Parking issues due to renovations has cleared up now, thank goodness! And after a therapy session, there are many places close by to eat! This is a great area!"

2PwC6DOrroU2Y42tool7vQ,-JPD-daF29asf-DApoUF2w,"I have been attending Omita's yoga class on Tuesdays at 6pm for several months now. I have increased my flexibility, balance and focus tremendously. It's amazing to see the postures I'm able to do in such a short time! I look forward to Tuesday evenings every week - it's all about subtle, yet strong, movements, breathing and relaxation. I always feel personalized attention when in class and am able to remain focused - even after a stressful day at work! The class is suitable for every level - I have gained advancement in my movements and have noticed that those who attend the class as beginners also feel comfortable (just as I did when I started attending). Omita's soothing voice also helps me to relax and feel at ease :)
I've been to other yoga classes and this one is by far the best! I'm able to advance at my own pace, while still in a group setting to add to my motivation.
If you're looking for a yoga class - no matter what level - this is a wonderful class. And, the first session is only $10! Come try it out!!"

Yesterday I revieved a haircut from Miami fades that was a complete disaster. Upon walking in I was greeted by a clueless skater boy who didn't even know I had an appointment. After searching for more than 5 minutes he finally found my name and took me in. He was extremely rude to me and didn't even bother looking at the picture of the haircut that I wanted. He began buzzing the sides of my head without my consent. I tried to tell him to stop but he argued saying that i can only get a haircut here if I buzz the sides. Like really. He then began gossiping to his friend beside me in a foreign language. The friend was also a complete lunatic as he was taking pictures of his client without them knowing Talk about disrespect. He then went onto cutting the top of my hair which he barely touched and demanded that I pay him 30 dollars. I urge anyone who wants to go to the vaughan or any location for that matter to think again. This place is dirty, unprofessional, and expensive. So please do yourself a favour and don't go to Miami fades even if you've heard from your friends like I did that it is a good place well guys it's not."

Within a matter of days, check engine light was back on and the codes indicated at Auto Zone that the ignition coils were bad.  I looked under the hood and noticed that one of the ignition coils looked new but the other two were clearly the original coils.  When asked if ignition coils were included as part of the tune-up service, I was told they were.  After leaving it with them overnight, I'm told the next day that ignition coils are not part of the tune-up service.  So $600+ got me 3 wires, 6 new spark plugs, and only one of the three ignition coils.  I will never go back or spend another dime here and I suggest everyone else do the same."

xPhez4YuKRkVFDb77hIVvA,ipvTDpAx1NkipLUBBp0-kw,"I recently came in and requested for ombre and baylage with blonde. I was told by the stylist who was perhaps in her early 40's, fringe bangs with shoulder length brown hair that it was not realistic because my hair was too dark. She then proceeded to convince me to do something different, even though I had told her I was willing to take the risk. She then realized that my hair lifted very well with the blonde, however it was quite evident that the reason why she was trying to convince to not do ombre/ baylage was because SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THE HELL SHE WAS DOING. She over charged me 226$ for half a head of highlights. She did not do ombre/ baylage, and for the work she did, I could have gone else where and payed half the price for the mediocre job she did. The place was completely empty, I suppose because this place is over priced and the stylists are inexperienced. The ironic thing about this is that I requested for a ""senior"" stylists, assuming that with seniority comes great knowledge and experience.....DEFINITELY not the case. I do not recommend this location to get your hair done, especially coloured."

I went there at 6 p.m. on a weekday, they close at 8 - out to lunch sign on the door, I literally watched her right outside the MasterCuts door chatting with some friends for an hour. I called MasterCuts and she quickly got up and went and opened the door to answer the phone then I promptly hung up. I walked up to the now open shop and  the girl told us she was booked for the rest of the night ...her appointments must not have shown up because she just continued chatting with her friends outside the door for the rest of the night. Against my better judgement I went back there today, I got a 10-minute haircut, she spent 15 minutes telling me about her nieces birthday party, I asked for a 3 on the side and texturize the top. She was so busy telling me about her birthday party she didn't even bother to texturize the top. I just wanted out of there, when I was leaving she told me how she evened out my sideburns; pretty sure she needs glasses because now they're really uneven. Here are the after photos."

Now, just a month later, she is so excited when she shows up she runs in to start playing.  
The flexible hours work with our schedule. We don't have to commit to days and hours.  They work with us, and understand not every family has a 8-5 job. 
We love getting pictures and video all day of her activity.  She is learning and developing social skills she won't get at home (only child).

EsCSATOT6Nu2lThGbJCc0A,A_u6i0ApVQi33k_wp8froA,"I bought a groupon for a teeth whitening session in November 2016. The clinic was clean and the receptionist (who also did my teeth whitening) was very kind. Prior to my appointment, I read warnings from groupon and yelp that the employee has a habit of trying to sell products. This was true and I declined the home whitening kit. I thought the employee was done trying to sell me products and just making small chat (not trying to be rude but she had a slight accent and I did not understand that well) and kept telling me that the prices on groupon were uncertain and that they might increase. I have no prior experience purchasing from groupon so I did not know that you're billed before hand. The receptionist billed me for $70 (excluding tip) and asked me when I would like to set up my next appointment. I had no intentions on having a second teeth whitening session so I told her ""I will call you when I have the time"". I was very confused why the bill was so high as I had a 20% off coupon and the groupon quoted me ~$45. I called and the employee told me I had purchased a second session. I eventually called back to ask for a refund as there was a misunderstanding and the manager said they did not offer refunds but I would be able to transfer the teeth whitening session to a friend. In the end, I understand that it was my fault for not asking why the bill was $70 before I completed my transaction but this place would've received 4/5 stars if they would just stop trying to push their products onto their clients."

Cons: You (the consumer) must be knowledgeable about what is required... they will not help you with this aspect! As I learned from the 2nd notary I had to find on a Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend), a Commissioner (which was provided by Instant Notary) does not have the same powers as a Notary Public. Depending on the documents you need to get signed, this makes a difference! In their defense (and why this isn't a 1-star review),my (out-of-province) lawyer had mentioned there was a requirement and I tried to pass on the message, but truthfully I didn't really understand the exact situation so I probably didn't articulate it well. Anyway, I assumed the Instant Notary would know when I mentioned it, since this was a pretty routine property sale form. Turns out they didn't know/care and just signed my document as a Commissioner, which was then rejected (later that day on Friday) and hence my frantic rush to find a notary on the weekend.

Tl;dr: This place will take your money and sign your documents very quickly. But you best make sure you know whether you need a commissioner or a notary."

wTbHEY6aQ2MB2zzYPnm9Bw,zsZVg16yjZu5NIiS0ayjrQ,"I cannot even begin to express how pleased we were with the Capitol Event Theatre, where we held our May 2011 wedding.  Everything about our wedding surpassed our expectations.  Our guests were so impressed with the venue and loved the fun atmosphere.  The huge bar and lounge area really set a fun tone and create a social setting unlike a standard wedding/banquet hall.  The grandeur of the main room (with hardwood floors and a huge chandelier and stage) is classy and traditional, but with a modern vibe.  We also loved that we could use the original marquee outside to put our own names and customized posters.

We held both our ceremony and our reception at the Capitol, with a cocktail reception on the Mezzanine level in between.

The meal was delicious, and we received such great feedback on all the various menu options (we started with a broccoli soup with goat cheese ravioli in it, and for the entrГ©e, guests had an choice of chicken or braised short ribs - the nice thing was, they got to order their choice AT the venue, rather than having to make up their mind in advance via the RSVP.  For dessert, we had crГЁme brulГ©e, and my Maid of Honour tells me it was the best dessert she ever had).  We have heard nothing but raving reviews, even from the celiac vegetarians, who must have been a challenge for the chef.   The food was still of top quality - my braised short ribs fell off the bone and practically melted in my mouth - and the presentation was also impressive.  The late night snacks we chose were comfort foods - mini grilled cheese, sliders, and regular and sweet potato fries.  Everyone enjoyed the meal so much that we heard many people say that were too full to enjoy the late night snacks.  A good problem to have!  

But above all else, the service was the most notably impressive aspect of the day.  The staff at the Capitol were so incredibly accommodating to any and every request we made.  Upon our arrival, my Mom asked how difficult it would be for me to get a cup of tea to calm my nerves before the ceremony began.  We were worried that we would be putting the staff out during a very busy time - but the staff were so eager to help, and delivered a hot cup of tea to the ""Green Room"" (bridal suite) faster than we could have imagined.  They also ensured that the Green Room was well stocked with water, wine, and anything else the bridal party might have wanted.  They servers kept asking us if there was *anything* we wanted.  We truly felt like VIPs, all night long.  

During the dinner, the staff kept the napkins folded on the tables.  And one thing that really impressed our guests - at each table, the plates were all laid by the servers at the exact same time.  It felt like such a classy affair!

The bar staff (who even concocted a yellow drink to match with our wedding colours) and serving staff were amazing - so personable, so accommodating, and of great spirits all night long.  All this while maintaining top-notch professionalism and class.  Our guests truly felt welcomed, and I believe that the friendliness of the staff significantly contributed to that.  

Leading up to the event, Carmelinda and Katelyn (a student I believe, who has since moved on) were both very pleasant to deal with, and quite organized.  They really ensured that all our special requests were made.  My only issue, which really had no impact on my day - was with the in-house A/V guys (Evolved Entertainment), who were slow to respond to emails and not overly helpful.  We brought in our own DJ, but had to still pay $750 to use the Capitol's audio system.  

We cannot stop talking about what a perfect day it was.  We recognize what a unique and customized event it was, and don't believe that we could have achieved that same feeling at any other venue.  We have not one single regret about our day.  We will be very quick to recommend the Capitol to anyone looking to throw a big event."

M5A5r0HbMRfTzidqMKYHfw,Og5Uu8lxOTnTT6dQmxFmzg,"As a long-time dweller of one of the best barbeque cities in the world (Memphis, TN.), I regularly frequented the Memphis-in-May festival's BBQ Championship.  Top Notch would be a seriously competitor.

For the past 12 years, dreams of ""barking"" dry ribs and sweet pulled-pork turned into nightmares as, one-by-one, chain BBQ joints sold leather and shoe lace masquerading as ""authentic"" Memphis-style BBQ.  Top Notch does it right understanding that ""dry ribs"" are an art form derived from perfectly blended spices, fruit-wood smoke and, at most, a scant amount of cider vinegar to salve the sweating pig.  The sauce I tried was not showy and complemented pork perfection, rather than attempting to cloak dry, under-cooked meat as is typical of many ""sauce-based"" chains.

Knowing how good the meat was, I would have still given 4 stars had Top Notch tripped on the sides, but they pulled through for 5 with great service and a sweet and crunchy (from a brown sugar, pecan topping) sweet potato casserole, which was practically a souffle, and a creamy potato salad.  I even enjoyed the Texas Toast, which was an adequate shovel for scarfing the last remnants of shredded pork and sauce.

Next time (read: Tomorrow), I will definitely indulge in the Cincinnati Chili - I hope to convince the owners to boil some pasta soon and serve up a 3-way, smothered in shredded cheese.  In any case, Ohio's loss is Las Vegas's gain when it comes to Top Notch Barbeque!"
PowjIhG798ql2FHP7a0Nsg,cA4UK3hJcTMVUHdanNP6xg,"McArthur Lanes is a fun way to kill an evening, if you're willing to splurge a bit just to bowl and enjoy a pitcher. This is probably the most expensive bowling alley I've been to, but that's not saying much since most of my bowling days were back when I lived on PEI and it was $5-$10 a night. 

However, there were features at McArthur Lanes that I was never able to experience before, which almost makes up for the steep price. First, their bowling balls are those huge Fred Flintstone type with the holes for your fingers. They are highly enjoyable to toss down super waxed wooden floors amidst black lights and disco music. The alley also allows you to bring your drinks straight to your lane, which is a nice way to keep the game going at a leisurely pace. 

I would more so recommend this alley to parents looking for a birthday party idea. They have package deals for birthday parties and kids would be more apt to love the black light disco, food and carnival-esque games room."

r9RInq9B_cT1raDM4bNE6Q,JX4S_a2UVi6wEL1tF1G2ng,"Had been longing to try this restaurant.  Went with a friend for dinner and was SO  disappointed.  I did not expect dinner service to be on a polystyrene tray with plastic cutlery.  But I did like the food samples to try.

As another reviewer mentioned, I did not enjoy any of the spices; also the food was not very hot.  Upon eating dessert, I suddenly found myself crunching on a large piece of hard, jagged and sharp plastic.  I brought it to the attention of the server who looked at it and said 'Oh it is just a piece of broken plastic container!'  I looked at her incredulously, because the unspoken part of her sentence was 'so no big deal!'

I asked her if I could have a second dessert to take home.  She told me 'sure' and went away, only to come back with a plastic container of dessert, which she handed to me and walked away.  There was no apology or concern expressed whatsoever.

As I paid my bill, I said to the other server,'were you told that I found plastic in my dessert?'  She responded that she had and then charged me full price for the meal.  At the very least they could have comped my dessert.

Sadly, I won't be going back."

Several times he over billed her and she paid, trusting that he would never take advantage of her.  The final straw was when he performed labs, in his office, and sent the blood work to a Lab that was not in her insurance network.  Obviously, the claim was denied as out of network.  When  I called to question as to why they sent it to the wrong place they said ""our girl screwed up and we fired her'.  I then asked how they were going to remedy the $1000.00 bill my mother received to which they replied ""that's not our problem and when this has happened in the past, Dr. Lagstein chooses to not get involved'. My mother was never even given the option to go to a lab on her own, ensuring that it would be covered.  VERY frustrating.  I immediately told her that she would no longer be seeing this doctor anymore.  She is now with an incredible doctor who really cares about her and not just working her through the system to get as much money as possible out of her.
Do not go to this doctor, if you must, watch his billing closely and question every test and how it will be billed and sent out."

(So she apparently didn't bother to actually read my resume? Nice). I corrected her on her mistake, mentioned my collective admin experience, my Bachelor's degree, and that I was a stay at home mom for 6 years. She then informed me that since I have no sizeable recent admin experience that they couldn't place me in anything admin because most of their clients want someone with recent experience, and then she told me she was cancelling my appointment and sending me a list of agencies that might be better suited to help me (which was just a scanned list of very poor quality with names and phone numbers). Maybe I'm just projecting because I'm frustrated in general but I am FURIOUS! She was so rude and unhelpful and snarky.  I have been unemployed for almost a year - I have found that I am either underqualified or overqualified.  I was hoping that ""interviewing"" with an employment agency would be helpful, but this experience has left me completely stumped.  I am beyond dissatisfied with AppleOne and their treatment of me.

asfWdi7NSn_DQDMzyRQ60Q,E_7OArtPd8zcQQardVVJUA,"Decent place, slowly being renovated. Have to disagree with the other poster. Sauk Creek Apartments has been a great place to live. Decent sized apartments. Are they perfect, no, but for the location the price is about where it should be. If you want amenities like a pool, or fitness center, then pay an extra 2-300 a month and move into another complex.  The staff has always been helpful and prompt, save a few hiccups, but nothing ridiculous. Management is fine and the actual owner cares about his property. They are slowly working on improvements, but to have the most modern apartments would require paying significantly more each month, so check out surrounding properties and see. I did, and Sauk Creek offered the best deal. Maintenance handles the cleaning of the halls which are usually immaculate at all times. Garage is kept clean and clutter free. Noise is rarely a problem, never hear neighbors talking or tvs, never in  the four years I've lived here in 3 different apartments. The fact that they are always at capacity says a lot about the place. Once in awhile, I might here my current upstairs neighbors if they are really banging things around on the floor, but that is part of living on the first floor. I talked to them and they are very considerate about not disturbing us which takes quite a bit of effort to achieve anyway, so problem was solved. I have always lived in places people seem to complain about it , and I never have a major problem that isn't dealt with promptly and am always treated with respect. I presume that is because I am a respectful tenant. You don't use your washer dryer when not home out of respect for the property, ie if the water hose bursts or dryer fire starts. Not that big a deal to use it when home, not that they would know if you did anyway. I wouldn't do it in a personal home, why would I do it here?"

What I appreciate about Dr. Bramley, is that he is objective about animals. He is obviously an animal lover, but he does not judge you if you chose not to provide the medical care for your dog that you would for a child. Regardless of your decision, Dr. Bramley will not judge. Related to this point, they don't try to up-sell you on treatments, dog food, dental work, etc. If you want it, they will provide it, but they won't give you a sales pitch and try to get you to spend more than they quoted you.

How about forcing your child to re-register 2 or 3 times per year.  Why?  So they can charge you $30 pop each time you re-register.  If you don't pay it then they tell you they cannot guarantee your child's time slot!  They demand payment in June for August.  When August rolls around they charge you for September after only 2 lessons.   They change the payment terms also.  Instead of paying on the 1st for the next 30 days.. they charge you on the 1st for the next 45 days. essentially keeping 6 weeks of your money at all times!   Question them on the phone and they won't let you get a word in.   Just as the other reviewer said, their customer service is atrocious and seems offended when you question their policies.

4FV0pTmEMLRlIt3v5dJ8GA,4HktcibKVGtsxSx8gJ56GA,"Condescending service, and, as the previous reviewer mentioned, very little selection for small band sizes. 

They won't sell a bra without sizing you first, and don't welcome walk-ins (while I was in the store, the saleswoman told another woman to leave and book an appointment from home online or by phone, that Saturday fittings needed to be scheduled at least a week in advance -- how's that for service?).  They also refuse to order sizes they don't already carry in the store.  

Despite their promising website and what seemed to be a large selection, I would absolutely not recommend this shop, especially if you already know your bra size and/or are a petite woman.  As much as I want to support local businesses, I can say ordering online feels much better than dealing with these people."

-good in-house maintenance people, prompt response
-keep their distance, not constantly nagging

Problems
-very unprofessional, some downright rude, office people 
-charged $200 for a small dent in a wall from a door stop not working from damage deposit 
-charged $150 for ""carpet depreciation"" AKA lived-on wear and tear (no carpet damage)
-didn't come to look at screen door that was damaged, but on move-out date hired out and charged the repair from damage deposit
-tried to run a payment through too early (told them to thursday and they did wednesday) and charged a penalty for it coming back NSF

SpAhG1_YhcYULPvAGAwWeg,IxgZ6ybQDwxg_QBXsUVB1A,"This review has been long in the making!

I have been going to Dr. Shirley's dental practice for a few years now after many more years of unsatisfactory service with previous dentists. There are three main things I look for in a dentist:

1) Service/Care
2) Affordability
3) Visible Improvement

1. As soon as you walk into their quaint office you are greeted with a smile or two from the reception desk. Whether you are a walk-in or a regular, they know how to take care of you. Dr. Shirley has an excellent small team that you quickly get to know over just a few visits. I don't really like phone calls when I am at work and so they offered email appointment reminders and even automated text messaging to confirm or cancel appointments (which is a huge plus for me!).

Dr. Shirley and her hygienist are good at what they do and they do it well. I thought my first few cleanings with them were painful but that was simply because I had not given oral health a priority in my life. Not only are they good at what they do, but they also educate you on the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of oral hygiene and personal cleaning regiments. I wasn't an avid flosser at all until Dr. Shirley & team encouraged me to floss regularly and I am happy with the results!

2. I have insurance coverage from my company but it doesn't take away the fact that their office administration fully mediates my bills and payments with my insurance company. They give me an update of my coverage and leftover balance upon request and it saves me so much time and needless paperwork. I have paid in cash a few times and their prices are comparable to surrounding practices in the area if not even cheaper due to their location. Plus they give you promotional coupons and gift cards for referring new clients.

3. Once in a while they still show me the x-ray of my teeth/gums from when I first came to them. Visible improvements indeed! I still have work to do over the next little while but Dr. Shirley and her team have been such a great help in the process.

Note: One comment I do have is with schedules and time. If you know that you have a tight schedule on the day of your appointment, let the office know ahead of time. There have been a few times when my appointment was delayed for up to 15 minutes and while this doesn't affect me much, I know how it can be an issue for others. If they are ever running late with appointments (due to other patients arriving late) they are very apologetic about it and honestly I think it says more about their patients than it does about their practice.

Overall, I highly recommend Dr. Shirley's Dentistry especially if you are in the Scarborough area. She is a knowledgeable, experienced, good-humoured dentist supported by an excellent team of skilled, friendly assistants. Plus they give you a bag of goodies on your way out (no not candy, that would be counterintuitive)!

The only thing missing short of 5 stars is a lattГ© machine in their waiting area. A man can only dream...

Radio Shack is always my 'go to place' for these types of needs and I swung into this one because it was close to the dog sitters. The manager could obviously see I was in a hurry, so I told him I needed a car charger for the laptop Within 2 minutes he found the charger, rung me up and out the door I went! And while he had no control over it, it was on sale! I love it when the staff knows the product and can read the situation!"
3gn1tgwQ8PTdjXt0oBAV5w,JHKnoLXwzoQE4iy6sHylkg,"Better quality than than Office Max, Target, or Walmart. Low prices. I was looking for a stapler made out of REAL metal and not a cheap piece of plastic that will break and go to the landfill in a year. Unlike Office Max, they had what I was looking for at a decent price. School supplies were on sale and good quality, so I added those to my basket. I asked if there was a place in Madison where I could donate or recycle used packing peanuts (I hate sending styrofoam to the landfill). They weren't aware of any, but told me to bring them to the store and they would re-use them for something. I was surprised and pleased that they wanted to help me and the environment! Overall, a good experience."

I went into Sergenian's Floor Coverings and was immediately approached by Bob.  I explained what I wanted and what my price range was.  He was so helpful.  He immediately went and found samples for me to bring home.  It was easy and didn't require much time on my part. 

I had went into other stores and was not even asked if I needed help, so I just walked out.  Bob did an amazing job.  He was so willing to work with me and assist me.  Without his assistance, it would have taken me forever to find what I was looking for and the entire ordeal would have been overwhelming.

The installation went smoothly.  We have a lot of very heavy furniture that needed to be moved.  The carpet is beautiful and the price fell right into our price range.

I highly recommend Sergenian's and our salesperson, Bob."
rzcCrNNqpPYhMSOVfpYezw,YN1jj0a0icIoZBUoN-HP5Q,"There are only a few courses accessible to downtown Torontonians who lack a car, and Dentonia is a decent choice. The location is great, from yonge/king it only took about a half hour on the subway to get to the Victoria Park subway stop and the course is literally just outside the station.

With that said, Dentonia is a pretty short course. Each hole is around 100 yards and all are par 3. However, the course isn't boring - the course is quite 'hilly' and over all it's pretty fun to play.

During the day it was only $22 for 18 holes, and $10 for rentals - however, I've got to say these were the saddest rentals I've every played with. Only 5 clubs (including a putter), but to be fair if you are a decent player you could probably play the entire course with only a pitching wedge and a putter!

As mentioned in the other review, the astroturf mats are a pain. If they got rid of those and had the drink cart do a few more rounds (only came around once) I would be a fan."

vIyxu2PK48X8GPJ7B-z9wg,vdnMuP5iuEalosGN_XIUsQ,"My experience here was weird as shit.

I came to the Pickle Barrel with two friends one morning a couple of months ago. We sat down, ordered coffee and drinks, and then waited. Forever. I'm not kidding. My friend's diet coke eventually made its way into the picture at some undefined point in time, but all three of our waters and the coffee just never came. There were maybe 4 other customers and definitely 3 employees working the entire time we were there. We all ordered something off the menu and NOT ONE OF US got what we ordered. And while we ate what we didn't order...we still didn't have drinks after politely reminding the staff twice. How the hell is this place still in business? 

I do have to say that the staff atleast knew what poor service was going on and took several items off of our bill. I think I ended up paying 89 cents or some really weird amount. The experience was almost like being drunk in a completely sober state as I left the place thinking to myself, ""Did that just happen? Is this real life?""

What a ""pickel"" that situation was."

I have experienced over 200 different masseuses and I've had good and not so good but these two are the best. I noticed after we met they  would ask me if there were an areas that I needed to focus on more than another and during the massage they would point out problem areas that I have and how to reduce the pain by ice and stretching at home. Also pointed out that drinking plenty of water after the massage is very helpful for getting rid of the toxins. They were very helpful and I will refer whenever I can. Also my wife got her best massage ever there from another wonderful masseuse. The offered water before and after treatment. I used the Living Social coupon and saved $30 every massage.

9OkrzUD58_yqPtJ2NI_vqg,gKJnqRnw6ktPkPAKU7bTvA,"I was use to going to a neighbor or friend who did mechanic work. After we moved, I didn't know or trust anyone with my car; afraid someone would break something on purpose just so I'd keep coming back or take advantage because I'm a female who doesn't know much about cars. My boyfriend at the time always took his car to the Firestone {next to Monroeville Mall}. Although they were a bit pricey {compared to what I was use to paying}, you always got genuine service; even print outs of the diagnoses of your vehicle, the name of the mechanic that worked on your car, and a breakdown of the prices/labor and any recommended services they feel you need but you don't have to get {or rejected} at the time. The guys at FS were always friendly, greeted you with a smile, professional, knowledgeable and remembered you if you came back. They'd even take you to the back to show you just how BAD the part was they are fixing for you.  Although there were FS' closer to where I lived, I kept going back to this one because I was comfortable with them and trusted that they will get the job done. I also love how they will talk with you first and tell you what's wrong to get your consent before proceeding on repairs. The mall is a two minute walk from them so I would go shop a little or catch a movie to keep me from dying of boredom while someone worked on my car. Depending on what I needed and if I scheduled an appointment or came in last minute {like I normally did}, I was always in and out of there from half hour to no more than 2 hours.

That said, they're friendly in a gruff sort of way, and it has a warm atmosphere.  The odd live band or jam session with some very good musicians too.  Unsurpisingly, the music tends to be hard rock or country.  Giddy up!!

I felt welcomed and present when I got there, and left feeling strong and refreshed in both mind and body.

ZyS_DEmUNRVOzyxqWD0tCg,feSQtsMoXYmgMZH8o1ZlnA,"I have been trying to find a good car wash near me in Parma, and this is just one more failure.  Washes are 9, 13, or 15 dollars, plus tax.  I got the 13 dollar wash (14 after tax) which was supposed to include a rinse of the bottom of my car.  The guy rinsing the car before the machine did not rinse under my car, so maybe the machine does it, but I couldn't tell.  A guy dries the car with towels at the end.  I tipped him, because I'm not a cheap a**hole, but this means that I paid 16 dollars for a car wash where the inside of my car was not touched.

They have ""free vacuums"" that you can use to vacuum the inside of your own car.  Only the first one out of the three had any kind of suction.  I resent paying 16 dollars to vacuum my own car.  I will not be coming here again.  You can run your car through the 6 dollar auto wash at BP and get the same wash for 10 dollars cheaper.  Someone please tell me where I can get a real FULL SERVICE car wash in Cleveland."

They said they couldn't come out until the following Friday between 11am and 2pm.  I agreed to this arrangement.  They required my credit card information and when I asked them why they needed it in advance, they said that if I had to cancel for some reason and didn't give them at least a 24-hour advance notice they would charge my card $85.  Ok.  I didn't have to cancel, but they did...a few hours before they were to arrive because the tech's truck broke down,  and that they did not have another opening until the following week on Thursday.   I asked if they had anything on Monday to which the manager replied, ""No, we have a short staff on Monday"".  I asked if he realized that next Thursday was nearly another week away (while in the meantime my door is nearly completely down).  I then asked if their policy applied to them as well and if they were willing to take $85 off their fee since they didn't call me to cancel 24 hours in advance. They said, ""No"".  The person answering the phone gave me attitude, but when I called back and spoke with the manager, he didn't make me feel any better.  I canceled the service run and told them to destroy my credit card information.  I don't know who actually owns this business, but if the owner is reading this, you should strongly consider finding a new manager and office help immediately or you will lose your business.

Interesting spot for a sandwich shop. Good thing I use my navigation device to find this place. It's kind of hidden away. Not like a stand out eatery like the Jack in the Box or Burger King at the corner. The subway is nestled near other establishments."

1cQUDlHvfOvSo_WmJIS-MA,XSCzjLXpM7yf-RBHfBOaUg,"Dash Design (DD) excels in: 1.) Customer Service, 2.) value for cost; 3.) installation of seat covers, dash cover, sun shade.

Customer Service. Diana responded to my email regarding seatcovers in one day. Made arrangements and scheduled installation resulting in doing everything possible to resolve my issue. Laura (Retail Office) was very professional and definitely on top of my concern and made install quick & easy. Marco, the installer, does excellent work. Note: Experience required for installation of front seatcovers. I didn't get back seat covered. I watched Marco work and am glad that I live where install is possible.
Value: Seatcovers reasonably priced. I suggest getting swatches before ordering as the materials differ considerably.
Dash Cover: Very nice cover. Would have preferred a better selection of fonts for customization. Just a personal preference.
Sun Shade: Marco installed and I recommend having some experience in this install also. The bases for the sun shade have very strong adhesive and would not be easy to re-position in the event of an error. If any one reading this review knows a way to remove this type of adhesive product without affecting the windshield, please email me at Yelp or post a review. Providing this information would have resulted in a 5 star rating.

Bottom Line: Product & service are a good value for the cost. Easily recommended with the above caveats in mind.

Pictures will follow:)"

You will not find a more caring and trustworthy agent. I am still waiting on a quote from another company that Kurt helped me with. This is due to the fact that my quote from SF was high and I fould cheaper elsewhere. He tried to beat it and couldn't. So, we are working together to get me the cheapest life insurance policy we can for my family. Who else does this. NO ONE!!! 

He cares about his clients and will work tirelessly to get you the best policy for your family and future. Caring is the word I would use. What else would you want in an Insurance Agent?"

They are very responsive at all hours of the day via email and have found that when I request a ""skip this week"" cleaning they have no problems;with that request at all.  When a cleaning is not up to my expectations, a simple email is all that is required and they send back the team to make sure you're satisfied.

My pain was relieved within the first few visits and he gave me a lot of at home tricks to help get my body back in line. He is very knowledgeable and is only concerned about his patients. The atmosphere is one on one and very relaxing. He is so easy to talk to that I feel like I am just stopping in to visit a friend and getting healthy at the same time. Go see Dr. Budny!"

Last time I decided to show the staff my pizza with no cheese. They apologized and made a new pizza, which is now undercooked AND still had no cheese. If you enjoy eating dough and pizza sauce I would highly recommend this place. As for me, I'm never going back. Life's too short for less than mediocre pizza."

cNGVnoA2r-sozn6n9jIuvw,c6Mz0dSXzvGtQOZCjCWtKQ,"This particular Shoppers Drug Mart location is unique and I've been told the only one like it in Toronto. I have always loved having a neighbourhood Shoppers and having one close to home is usually on my list of apartment hunting criteria. When I moved into the Upper Avenue neighbourhood I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is the 'organic Shoppers' of Toronto. It's like having a combination of the Big Carrot, Whole Foods and a Shoppers all in one store... 

They carry mainly organic/health food & natural cosmetics, other unique items and including a pharmacy. I can find stuff here, such as non-GMO Morinaga smoothie-grade soft tofu, that is hard to find elsewhere in the area (I only like this brand for making chocolate pudding!) I also found a favourite Burts Bees product here that I haven't been able to find at other Shoppers locations. Plus they have a great essential oils collection that seems to get a little bigger each time I check for new oils.

UPDATE - Sept 2014: This Shoppers is currently completing a major renovation and product offering change. I am still evaluating whether or not it will retain the uniqueness that I loved about it before. So far what I can say is that they are loading their shelves with more food, mostly PC & Blue Menu products, and less independent organic product lines... To be continued."
FVSmE5tyKiYBH93Tv2mhQQ,ZpL6DHxg5dY0oHqghNtvWg,"Segredo has been under new management since about June 2012. All previous reviews no longer apply. Bowling has been gone for years and the barstaff is completely different - actually the entire staff has changed since June 2012. 

With that being said, this is my review.

Segredo is easily the best nightclub in Madison. They bring in music acts of all sorts from larger cities, with a focus on electronic music. Wolfgang Gartner, Run DMT, Foreign Beggars, R.L. Grime, ill.gates, The Cataracs, Griz, and many many more. They also have local acts such as Vinnie Toma, The Dirty Disco Kids, and Mike Carlson. 

The staff and venue are amazing. Awesome lighting, cool fog machines, hot gogo dancers, and a great sound system. 

The crowd varies greatly according to what the event is that night, but generally there is a large amount of diversity. 

I suggest checking it out. It gets busy at about midnight, so try to get there before then if there is a big name performer that night to avoid waiting in line."
cKHPIk8dtTeh66w0a-q3KA,NrgJ-4n6ZtSm4wMLroEayA,"I love Cat, and Cat's Eye Vintage.

Each time I have been here, and at each location I've visited, I've found absolute gems. I love my vintage clothes, so shopping at Cat's Eye is not just a joy for me in that regard, it's a great place to go to meet other vintage lovers and chat with them. 

I've brought both more modern second hand pieces with a vintage flair and older pieces here, including a 1950's pale blue day dress, and my latest find, a 1950's houndstooth dress that makes me look like Joan from Mad Men! 

There's a lot to look through (it's a pretty crammed space) but if you're looking for something specific, Cat really knows her stock and will search for pieces that meet your ideas. 

Some things are in better condition than others (as always with vintage) but the prices are really good, especially in comparison to some other vintage stores, and Cat will give you a discount if she has a piece that you want which will need repairs."

Got into an altercation over a delayed time (6-7 business days) to receive a membership and did not honor the 1 week free pass for a friend that came with the membership when it finally did arrive. Not sure how you can just deny a coupon provided by their corporate location. Her greeting when we walked in was ""Well, what's going on here?"". We had no idea if she was in charge or trying to start up a conversation and even then was very confrontational. Single-handedly she lost the company over $1,300 in memberships that day as the three of us will not be returning and will be ""eating"" our $9 month ""free"" membership. The machine layout appeared awful and way too close to one another. I highly suggest looking elsewhere if you're looking for a gym.

Great value, and the owner and staff are super friendly.

kv61fbQ0z-vppt4G5Dzqgw,WI49L8M_lHmwRQwX71OMIg,"I update my review of Parkland Commons to ZERO stars; I have to click on one star to post this review but believe me, the place is now a big fat zero.  This new management (Apogee, I believe they are) is downright slack and incompetent.  If my episode with the screen patio door wasn't bad enough, now I am walking on wet carpet since Wednesday evening.  I come home to find my carpet soaked near my AC unit.  I ""lucked out;"" I left message on emergency maintenance line (BTW the message on that line still had the ""The complex doesn't have power"" spiel from last month's power outage.  A maintenance person came by and fixed the problem but informed me it would be Friday or Monday before someone could come to dry out wet carpet.   Really? Why should it take two days or more to have someone come dry my carpet?  To add fat to the fire of disorganization, this maintenance rep said she was unable to enter my apartment earlier that day (I had already placed work order about AC that morning) because ""She didn't have a key.""  The maintenance manager had quit (smart guy to get off this incompetent ship) and no one knew where the keys were - he may have kept them in a shed?  Lordy, lord.  Spare keys to residents' apartments are floating out there in the universe.  WTF aren't these keys in the manager's office anyway????  Maintenance should sign out key when doing work order and sign it back in at manager's office when work order completed.   Of course I try to call office while at work Friday but get placed on hold (you never get a live person, it's always a recording that places you on hold) twice.  I left a message with assistant manager inquiring about when carpet would be dried out and of course received no reply.  This is unacceptable.   If I am late with rent, they won't chase me down, call two or three times, etc - they will post eviction letter and soon the sheriff will be there to put me out on the street.  I've lived in apartments in 3 states since the 1980s and have NEVER experienced the unresponsiveness and outright incompetence of management like I have now at Parkland Commons.  The place is turning into a dump fast - literally as furniture and other large items are overflowing near the dumpster.  I asked the office about why no one had picked up this junk and the assistant manager said the company that picks up such refuse only comes twice a month.  Well,  that pile of crap was there last month and the pile has grown and it is now Aug 5 and I will bet money it will be Sept 5 and the pile of crap will still be there.  If you need a place to stay in east Charlotte, I definitely don't recommend PARKLAND COMMONS.  BTW, I came home this evening and of course  no one had come to dry out carpet - nor had anyone bothered to follow up with a phone call or email to say when this problem would be fixed.  I left message on emergency line and - you guessed it - no one bothered to even reply."

It sounds really stupid but I think their employees should take their jobs seriously. 
  I was also a little annoyed because the dressing rooms were all locked and the employees had to unlock them which took a long time. 
  Overall my experience was average though. I loved how all the clothes were all folded and nothing was out of place. The employees were nice for the most part.

And then they started getting a wee bit too 'trendy' and clearly altered who their manufacturer is, probably about 18 months ago. 

They still have some gorgeous things in stock, but NOTHING, and I mean NOTHING, fits properly anymore. 

Waistlines hit at the wrong place, everything is bindingly tight in the arms & thighs, each and every piece of clothing makes you look stumpy and heavy.

Unfriendly service, and although there were 3 empty spa pedicure chairs I had to sit up on this uncomfortable chair with my feet in a portable water bath - so much for a chair massage. The facial was even worse. Harsh lights so it was more like a doctors exam room than a spa experience. When most (good) estheticians would give you a massage and set the room up so you could zone out while any treatment was left to sit on your face, this woman quickly massaged my hands and arms and left. I laid there for what I guess was at least 30 min. I was ready to get up and wash the stuff off my face myself I was so cold and bored. When she finally returned she slapped on some cream quickly and said I was done. To top it off my skin didn't have that nice fresh spa feeling, it felt a bit cakey and chalky.

She has argued with me and been very rude when I attempted to clarify and ask a question. She often asks how much the contents of my parcel is worth even though she doesn't need to know that.  She continuously tries to push me to pay extra for things that I haven't asked for...

If you have a similar experience, please report this to Canada Post."

k7HbaTePrZJ9ZsJBhg0dqQ,3patSVpuFxDKT0PS_4DhRg,I couldn't recommend this company more. I have tried in the past to get a payday loan through online services and was constantly being rerouted to different websites and was asked to put in sensitive information in some less than legit looking ways. Luckily I found Mr. Payday Easy Loans. From the beginning of the process I was so satisfied with the service and the customer support representative was so helpful in allowing me to understand exactly how much I could borrow and how to ensure I could make the payments without getting stuck in the typical payday loan situation. I truly believe these individuals are there to help rather than just take your money and thanks to the expert advice I was able to get the money I needed within hours. The process was so easy and best of all I felt my information was being securely. Thanks Mr. Payday you have earned a return customer.

I took my clarinet there and they immediately looked at it. They update all of my info in their system. They checked it out and said there was a lot of repairs needed to be done. But since I was renting, All of the repairs are free. 

They gave me two options to drop it off now so they could fix it and come back when it was ready or get a new clarinet. I got a new clarinet. It was fast an easy, I only filled out one sheet of paper work and was done. Then I took a look around the store. Some of their merch is expensive, but instrument accessories are reasonable. I ended up get a book with songs from movies, musicals, today's top hits. It has almost 50 songs, and $18 is hard to beat.

Tl0_JsPz8B3I-opvSZXRGg,Ac0wMng3oi8wMLrvHdYNvQ,"This place replaced my favorite Wing's place that was there previously. When they opened, I thought it was the same place but with a different name...but was terribly disappointed to see that it turned into a run of the mill hipster urban coffee place. 

To be fair, I'm neither a coffee fan or a fan of any time of quiet, expensive and classy looking cafes. I would rather chow down on some wings or some carne asada burritos anyday, but I decided to give this place a try.

The menu reminded me of Sack's, a sandwich place by ASU and the price was remotely the same. The staff was very nice, chill and knowledgeable and they looked kind of bored sitting around and waiting for customers (I don't think it's that popular, I went there twice and I was the only person there every time).
The first time I went there I asked for an egg sandwich and they said they only served it up to 11am, and I was the only one there, it was around 12-1pm and I didn't see a problem in them cooking up some eggs for me (it's not like this place was Mccdonalds and had some harsh rule), but whatever. I had some kind of focaccio hot sandwhich, and for the price tag (7-8 dollars) it was...quite a disappointment. It was tasty, but it was definitely not worth the 7-8 dollar price tag. 
The second time I went there, I went around 9-10am to get the egg sandwich that I have been wanting to try the first time. It was originally 3.45 I believe, and by the time I finished ordering it was 6.00. The only substitute I asked for was instead of another meat with the egg, I would like 2 eggs. I don't understand how substituting meat for another egg was worth double the sandwich price when a dozen of eggs is 1.89 at Fry's. Regardless, the sandwich was actually very delicious, it tasted homely and very fresh. 
One of the things I like the most about this place is that all their ingredients seem FRESH. The lettuce is crispy, the eggs are hot, the bread is soft, the peppers are cold and refreshing. Other than that - it tasted like something that I could have made at home. 

Because the food is good, I'll give this place 4 stars. I was going to originally give it 3 stars, but I think it would be unfair seeing that the staff is nice, the food is fresh, and the place is clean and well kept. 
My only real gripe about this place is the price. If it was maybe a dollar less than the menu price, this place would be my #1 place to go for sandwiches and breakfast/lunch. But spending 7-8 dollar for a hot sandwich and 6 dollar for an egg sandwich that I could easily have made at home is something that I can't justify spending. :/"

My PCP had retired so I needed to get in quickly for some routine pre-op lab work.  I had already mentioned to scheduling that I had not seen this doctor but all of my previous records were in the system.  Today my husband scheduled an appointment with one of the doctors.  He took off of work and when he got there he was told that doctor was not even in on Mondays!!  They suggested that he go to the emergency room if he needed care. Apparently it was the 2nd time today that it happened. Sometimes it takes weeks or even months to see your PCP.

JHH5RLKHDb8DxVbAadF6DQ,VXvV2RqspVu-QNKJ963osw,"A Public Fit Theatre Company did a FANTASTIC job in presenting the play entitled, ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane."" The cast of actors and actresses were very believable and told the story with Broadway professionalism. The entire crew made everything look so real. My mother and I really LOVED it! At the end of the play, a moderator conducted ""The Buzz,"" which is like unto a commentary discussed with the audience, along with the cast and director. I believe ""The Buzz"" is given at the end of each play by A Public Fit Theatre Company. It is really a wonderful way for the audience to express what they thought of the play and how it made them feel. 

The Usual Place located in Las Vegas, Nevada is a great place to go to see live theater. The theater is such a rewarding experience because it is live. I like to call it a ""live movie right before my very eyes."" Make sure to visit A Public Fit Theatre Company website: http://apublicfit.org/ to find out all of their upcoming stage productions.

I think back to my high school days when 17th Ave had this tiny but wonderful vintage shop called Harlow that was a visit to eras past. Cat's Eye is like 10 Harlows and chocked full of vintage & costume goodness. It would take oodles of hours to browse through everything! It's literally 1000's of feet of rack upon rack of retro goodness. There's even some collectibles, furniture, jewelry, ties, hats and footwear. I adore the gowns and know the instant I feel like putting together a Sex-in-the-City-Carrie-NYC-eclectic-ensemble, that this would be the place to go.

I inquired about the rear and he said they didn't do the rear and if I wanted the rear done it would cost another $30 and another hour to wait.  Which would also not come with paperwork.

At 9 years old when I bought, the cheap construction grade original paint job had deteriorated considerably, and now at 14 years looked like crap.  I did my due diligence looking for painting contractors, even making a trip to the Phoenix home show to talk with contractors.  As luck would have it, I ran into Don at one of his job sites only a few blocks from home and asked for his card.  After checking his website and comparing notes I had of other contractors I knew that I wanted to request a job quote from Don.  I left a voice mail, had a call back within 2 hours and Don was at my house same day to talk business.  His offer was very competitive.  Some of the big pluses that you get with Don:
1)  I took Don to see several houses with the color scheme I wanted.  He tracked down the paint codes, got samples made and painted a small area on my house so I could verify.
2)  He started the job on the day he had told me he would, and finished in four days as promised.  
3)  Don does 100% of the work himself.  No subcontractors.  No day laborers.
4)  Don did extensive prep work:  high pressure wash and extensive stucco repair that became invisible under the finished job.
5)  Don used high quality acrylic latex paint from Sherman Williams, applied directly from the can to the house without watering it down, and left the unused paint with me.
Thanks for a thorough/professional job Don.  I have no hesitation in giving you a two thumbs up recommendation."

This place is family run, so there are only 3 people that seem to work here.  Even though I booked an appointment, I did have to wait for a little while in their cramped entrance, before I was seated in one of their fancy massage chairs.  It seems as though they won't turn away any walk-in's, the woman who owns the place would just ask if they would wait a bit or come back and they would help them then.  Tina is the woman who I have had work on me.  She has you pick a nail color from their 2 shelves of choices.  You get to operate the massaging chair however you like, which I think is great!  Tina is very friendly and goes a great, but simple, pedicure.  She offered to do a flower design of my choice on my big toes, for free, and did an amazing job at it!  I do wish there was a bit more of a foot massage given, although they do wrap your feet in hot cloths, which with the lotion makes them super soft!   They give you little foam flip flops to walk over to the driers in and you wait there until the polish is dry.  The second time I went, a few days later the polish chipped off in huge chunks, so I recommend going with the name brand polish.  

Overall the place is clean, with good reading material and flat screen TVs to watch.  The owner is always doing nails when I am there, I never see her take a break.  They offer all the usual acrylic and gel nails, as well as waxing and tanning, all at very reasonable prices!

I have had a great experience with Quynh-v and will continue to go here for my pedicures!  If you are looking for an affordable place to get your nails did, this is a great place to go!"

i had my procedure scheduled a week or so ahead of time.  I filled out their rather lengthy history form as soon as I got it.  But, since they insisted on contacting every doctor I currently see, one doctor did not reply in time.  They cancel the procedure without notifying me.  i had to ask someone to pick me up after the procedure.  Since it didn't happen, I have to ask them to do it again.  I found out it was canceled from the doctor who was going to do the injections.  He wanted to know why it was canceled.  So not only did they needlessly cancel my injections, but they cancelled it without asking the doctor who was doing it.   My doctor was livid.  His nurse said that this wasn't the only problem they have had with these people, and that they are considering ceasing to do procedures there.  Four hours after I was supposed to have checked in, this facility called me to tell me my procedure was canceled.  The started out like they were going to apologize, but turned into an explanation of why they were right for cancelling.  I tried telling them that the point was they didn't ever call me to cancel.  She wouldn't listen to that but insisted on telling me that they were in the right and next time they would try to be more efficient.  She just didn't get that there wasn't going to be a next time, and that going on and on wasn't necessary.  I finally had to hang up on her."

They are so accommodating and kind to all the pooches that visit.Bubba is very shy and they totally understand and look after each dog's unique paw-sonality. A great place for puppies to play with other pups their own age. A cozy home style atmosphere with couches that the dogs can go have a nap on it they choose. Or a little cubby hole-doggie den cave if they want some time out or peace and quiet. It is very clean and bright and spacious for all the pint sized pooches.Bubba the Dixie poo says it is wiener full and gives it 4 paws up as he can't give 5 paws but his mom gives it 5 stars.He can't wait to go back for 3 days in April if not before. Kudos  to No Bones About It for your professionalism and kindness. Love this place and am making No Bones About it to spread the word in the Beaches for this paw-some doggy daycare. They also have a wonderful groomer Erin who is paw-tastic with the pooches and gives them a paw-fect spaw day treatment and haircut. Bubba says she is weenerful too!!!!Thanks again to all of you.Keep up the great work."
e_D1vCgtadlK3syTMXVYVA,jxiWra-M9WnXf92xzWlfZw,"My first visit was for a pedicure. It was with a woman who did a good job. 

The second visit, however, was provided by an older gentleman who I can definitely say gave me the WORST manicure I've had in my life! 

But first I have to say: during the pedicure he got the backs of my things all wet and lotiony and left them that way. 

But that wasn't the worst of it.  Once we started on the manicure, he spent more time with his eyes on the TV than on my nails. He asked if I wanted them shorter and I said, ""No, just even.""  

He then proceeded to file my left hand nails down to basically the pink part and then barely file the nails on my right. My nails have never looked so shitty! 

Plus, he didn't even clean under them. He performed the epitome of a half-assed manicure. 

About 30 minutes after I left, the nail polish began to peel off of entire nails at a time. Here, the day after, I have zero polish on my nails.  

Just in time for my birthday too. Way to make a girl feel ugly. Now I'll try damage control of my own at home :(

I'll never go back! 

I've uploaded a photo of the damage for you.

I was so disappointed."

I love the Jacob store for its professional, classy clothing.  They carry some beautiful button up tops, as well as some gorgeous dresses!  I do seem to have trouble finding a good fit with some of their clothes, since I have curves.  So I highly recommend trying on your choices.  The prices for things are high, most tops are $30/40.  They can have some decent sales!

I love love love Jacob Lingerie!  The underwear is the most comfortable, yet sexy, that I buy!  Their bras fit really well and are cheaper than other lingerie stores I have been too.  They can have some very beautiful lingerie sets.  Their pj's are very comfy and the quality is great.  For the general price of things here I have got some of the nicest lingerie I have.  They have great deals on underwear and sales on bras too!  

I highly recommend checking out Jacob Lingerie, you will definitely find something for everyday or for those intimate times!  At great prices too!  Check out Jacob if you are looking for some classy pieces to add to your wardrobe!"

I was told it can't be accepted because it wasn't printed out on a piece of paper. The young girl argued with me, even when I showed her the proof of what was on the website for THEIR store, and continued to tell me the coupon could not be accepted. Pizza Hut ALWAYS honors their coupons, and FIXES THEIR MISTAKES. THIS IS THE WORST PIZZA EXPERIENCE and I will not be coming back to this store. I am going to let everyone on Yelp know how terrible the customer service is, and how rude your employees are. They are better off getting a pizza from Domino's, who always has grumpy employees, and terrible food, than getting a cheap piece of junk from this Little Caesar's.

I would be in the appt. for over two hours!  We did not get anything really accomplished until the third visit.  I ended up spending over $2000 on dr. appointments and tests in a matter of 6 weeks.  After all the tests were done it was now time to sock it to me with supplements.  No - you had to use their supplements to get any benefit so there went another $600 - $800.  I started in with all the crap they gave me, but the only thing EVERYONE in that office focuses on is to stop eating gluten or any kind of wheat and also stop all dairy.  They push a rice blend super food from their own supplement pool.  The thing that really got me was wheat nor gluten showed up as an allergy for me in the $400 blood work I had  had done.  Yet they still continued to push the no wheat thing.  I stated to one of the workers there while she was pestering me about wheat that I did not have a reaction in my blood work.  She stated that the expensive blood work could be a false positive!  What in the world did I just spend my money on!  What a waste!  So disappointed.  Unless you are ready to give up wheat and dairy I would just save your money.  That is what the entire staff will be harping at you about anyway!  Why bother with all the ""false positive"" tests.

4azv5Q-1FPH6grFlWZCiTw,sC27dOgvC3f7NUxJdg5FFw,"My long term hospice care wife was supposed to stay there for 5 days for her respite care.  I dropped her off on Friday morning and spent about an hour an1/2  with the head nurse going over the care she needed.  She has Epilepsy, Stroke, and had extensive brain, breast and liver cancer.  She also has necrosis of the jaw which needed additional care with a waterpik and oral rinse twice daily.  She stated she would pass her needs and my conversation on to the day and night staff.  She assured me she would be taken very good care of.

   I got a call at 9:30 p.m. by a nurse stating  Susan ""slipped"" out of bed an hit her head, but she was OK.  Susan also e-mailed me about the lousy food.  She can't talk due to her brain cancer and stroke.  I decided Sunday morning she could not stay there any longer, so I picked her up at 12:30 p.m.  They had her ready and we left.  During the ride home she told me she hadn't eaten since dinner the night before, nor did they give her, her medications for her epilepsy and necrosis of the jaw.  She also fell asleep on the way home.  I immediately fed her and when we got home.  I checked her hollow socket in her mouth from the nacrodis and it was full of bacteria.  She stated they didn't use the waterpik on her.  I then took her to the bathroom before I was going to give her a shower and put her to bed for a nap.  It was at this time I discovered her urine soaked jeans.  When I pulled her pants down to take them off along with her diaper I discovered her diaper was dripping wet with urine and Susan had stuffed about 10-15 kleenexes down the diaper to soak up the urine.  She said she asked to go to the bathroom and eat breakfast that morning and no one did anything.  As I got her ready for her shower I found bruises on the back of her head, cheek, arm and leg from ""sliding"" out of the bed.  I gave her a shower then put her to bed where she slept for 3 hours.  When she got up she needed to go to the bathroom.  Before I could get her there, she had a sever case of diarrhea.  Without asking if she had been constipated, they gave her stool softeners without telling me.  Needles to say I had a real mess to clean up.

Needless to say I'm glad I didn't leave her there until Wednesday.  I also noticed when I went into her room, there were no styrofoam glasses of water anywhere around her bed, or night stand.  She said they didn't give her any water in her room.  I wouldn't recommend anyone use this facility for long or short term care. I thought Desert Cove was bad, but this place was far worse."

Zdu9iSJhbWUh69aJRlf4Kw,E-xIkXDnkLuwEn_Z4AnDmg,"Horrible Dentist.
I saw Dr. Guice a few years ago and he had to fill a cavity.  I would have been better off having the tooth pulled out.  I, like many other people, have had a few fillings throughout my life without any issues.  After getting one from Dr. Guice, I had to return 3 more times to have it ""adjusted"".  Which means he had to grind it down because basically he didn't do it right the first time.  Following the filling and the adjustments, I began to suffer tooth sensitivity, which I've never had before.  Recently, I had to have the filling removed and my new dentist remarked that it looked as though I did the filling myself in the back of a van!  Luckily, I did not have to go through a root canal, but it was still painful. (This is why I'm posting a review now.)

Despite all the ""adjustments"", the only other contact from Dr. Guice's office was to demand payment for the procedure.  I told them I was happy to pay for the cleaning and the x-rays, which were covered by insurance, but I shouldn't have to pay for a botched filling.  They threatened to turn my account, about $105, over to a collection agency.  Great customer service and understanding.

So, if you're looking for a dentist, keep looking, there's probably a reason there are only 2 positive reviews."

RTXdF3UVzKd3bNcS57stgA,XChCfeJ6Yx2NDJIpIgRhyg,"At Puff  is a charming cafe just south of Yonge and Finch. It had only opened for a week as of this writing. My friend and I were just walking up Yonge St when we stumbled across it. 

The decor is very nice. I can tell the owner pays much attention to details;  from the decor to the dessert presentation. 

Dark maroon walls surround with gleaming white accents, there's a mix of hard and soft furniture. I spotted even a Tiffany table lamp. The furniture inside is much like one would find in a home.. it's conveys a mood that's warm and inviting and makes it nice place to read and enjoy nibble /drink. 

We noticed attached to the ceiling was this draping brown cloth? -- not sure if it for an effect or not but to me it felt like a backstage dressing room in Paris. 

After looking at the menu we decided on a couple of drinks and some puffs.

My pomegranate ice tea was very cool and refreshing. It was perfectly sweetened. The use of holed ice cubes cooled down the tea quickly. 

The puffs,  ice cream filled ones were served in a bowl, and the custard filled ones were served on white apex shaped plates. They were drizzled with chocolate sauce and powdered sugar. 

My take - the fillings were okay (had vanilla and macha),  they had put tiny pieces of butter toffee with the custard filled ones, I just found the choux pastry shell tasted a bit hard and bland."

The second receptionist seemed annoyed with my ""Good morning, how are you"". She reluctantly decided to stop doing 'nothing' and help me. She was unfriendly, couldnt hear anything I said and made me repeat myself several times... I think she would have just preferred I shut up and sit down to wait.

1. Your membership works at any Anytime location. I even went on vacation to the states and I happened to be staying near an Anytime Location, and my keyfob worked! So that was a nice plus.
2. The price has stayed the same for my entire term, never fluctuating up or down. I remember when the tax rate in Ontario increased, they even lowered their rate so that the total I paid (after taxes) would remain the same. MAJOR koodos to Anytime for doing that.
3. Affordable. I pay a fairly low rate, and whenever I am approached by other gym/fitness sales people, they simply cannot beat the price I pay at Anytime.
4. While the gym (obviously) gets busy at certain times of the day (between 4pm-9pm) or the year (January is busier than October), that is the same with all gyms. I go at a specific time during the day regularly (3x a week) and never really find myself waiting for machines. They were once a very tiny space, and have slowly begun purchasing the neighboring restaurants and expanding. The gym will be about 2x the size that it was when I originally joined.

This isn't the biggest gym, and it doesn't have the most machines. But for a small community and a great price, I think this gym works for me. The only thing I wish they had was a pool and maybe a few more bench press / squat racks, but for the price I cannot complain. Staff are friendly as well if you ever have any questions, and I've never once had a billing issue (they automatically take out the same amount from my  credit card every month)."
wFu7J8HyNNR69bEPaR7Lfg,aWmZdb21k6jq7P_qOHxXsw,"We were looking to buy a historic home and found Don through the Historic Phoenix website.  We had a great time looking at homes with him.  He was very honest about most things, and would point out flaws with the homes before we even noticed them.  He did keep pressuring me to use ""his guy"" for financing, even though I already had solid financing lined up elsewhere, so that was a little annoying.  He also fed us a couple pieces of wrong information.  

However, we never felt at any point he was pushing us into buying something.  Quite the opposite -- he actually talked us out of a couple homes.  He was very helpful... until we actually moved into our home and had a major problem with it.

We had a plumbing problem that turned into a nightmare.  Our home warranty plan that Don chose for us (without asking us if it was what we really wanted...) would not cover the repair, and we called Don desperately seeking help.  Right away he seemed hesitant to help us, but he did end up calling the home warranty people and upgraded our plan and got the repair covered.

The nature of the plumbing problem clearly implied that the previous owner of the home knew of this issue and did not disclose it to us.  Don agreed with us, and said he would call his ""broker"" and see what kind of legal action we could take.  Suddenly he stopped returning my calls, and my emails were being ignored.  I finally got him back on the phone and he told me suddenly my emails ended up in his ""spam folder,"" and he never got them, but he told me he ""safelisted"" my address. He again told me he'd contact his ""broker"" and we didn't hear from him again.  Emails continued to be ignored as well.  He clearly did not want to deal with this and was just brushing us off.  He already got his commission, so why bother, right?

We have since emailed Don with guidance on a couple things over the past year, and have had no response.  Guess it's that pesky ""spam folder"" again.

He did help us get the repair covered in the end, so he gets 2 stars instead of 1, but I would not recommend Don to anyone seeking to buy a home in Phoenix."
V6iuHzuMa33tb44z4yH8dQ,UKmTjatojLQWAr4T90T3tg,"Great service!  I needed meeting materials picked up at a kinkos in a suburb of Cleveland and brought to a hotel in an even more remote suburb.  I spoken with a few other companies that did not take credit cards...  Crazy!  Who on earth travels with business checks...

When you call a vendor, you usually know within the first 5 seconds of the conversation whether or not they are relaible / will provide good service / know what they are doing.  I was completely put at ease and really appreciated their tracking sytem which automatically generated a confirmation email upon delivery.  FYI, this was all very last minute and the pickup was for 6:30am (they were early for the pickup).

I would highly recommend them and will certainly use them again if I have folks in the area.  

One note to Bonnie Speed - I had iniatially asked for a courier recomendation from a hotel in Twinsburg and they are the ones who, after researching, directed me to another service that did not accept credit cards and did not exactly instill trust...  I would highly recommend introducing yourself to locals hotels in the 'burbs as I can't imagine I am the only person in need of this type of service on a regular basis!"

They are rude on the phone, though much better in person. They are unhelpful and curt. I am used to practices when you can have a more personal relationship with the doctor. If you have a few simple questions and do not want to book an appointment, or if you just want test results, you can call and ask for the doctor to call you back. The reception staff at this clinic is like a firewall. They don't give you any information on your own file, and they refuse to take messages for the doctor."

I ended up going to a different dental center for another check up. Turns out I didn't have ANY cavities and no work that needed to be done. They let me know my teeth were in great condition. I questioned them on the cavities and they were adament that there weren't any. I'm not 100% sure but I'm fairly certain that cavities don't disappear.

I am suing them to replace my entire driveway and walkway. I had a stain on the concrete and I contacted the owner who recommended that they grind and seal the cement. I inquired whether the concrete would change color and he assured me it would not. My home is very modern and grey and the entire front driveway looked brown - I have pictures. Also, when it rained, circular spots appeared on the entire driveway which I am guessing was water retention under the seal. It was a nightmare. When I asked him to fix this, he was non responsive and when he did meet me or my assistant on this project, his attitude was that was the way it was. I have since received affidavits from 2 commercial concrete companies who indicated he has materially damaged my driveway and walkway. I would not only not recommend this firm, but be prepared for a smooth talking owner who doesn't supervise his people as when I inquired as to whether the repair was done, I said have you seen it, and he indicated he did not. This is not right, and if I have to spend a lot more on legals to serve this con artist a lesson I will because I do not appreciate being taken advantage of, lied to, and conned."

After waiting half an hour and hearing nothing back from Chores, I called again and was told they hadn't been able to reach anyone but were still waiting to hear from one cleaner. Another half an hour later I received another phone call to inform me that there was no one available for my job, and asking me if I'd like to reschedule.

9PBaWtaum_nZk0qShY-89w,KOt3T83Dz4gtdUtxpR57Rw,"My boyfriend and I were really looking forward to the short 1.5hr glass flower workshop. It was fun enough, but the idea of seeing our final product was the part we really were looking forward to... it's also the part that never happened. 

The flowers went into the kiln and we were to pick them up the following week. Neither of the flowers we picked up were ours. Aside from the fact that the colours were all wrong (not even matching the colours available at our workshop) they looked nothing like the flowers in our videos or photos from that day. 

When we addressed this with the owner, Minna, she was reluctant to admit any mistake and wasn't really open to rectifying the situation. She was also rather rude. We expressed that we were more than happy to return the flowers to their rightful owners, and make new ones to replace the ones that were lost. All we wanted was to have our own flowers (it was our first glass making experience).

Failing that, and after some back and forth, we asked for a refund. She has now offered to refund our money (probably just to get rid of us). 

I personally understand that mix-ups happen, especially when she has many students. But how she responded to it, and the fact that we are walking away with nothing, leaves me extremely disappointed and sour about the whole thing. 

There are many glass studios in Toronto. I recommend trying one of those and avoiding playing with fire."

It took at least five minutes for anyone to even come out of the back room to help up and the gentleman had a rude attitude and was rushing us the whole time. He told me the only battery that would fit my Honda Accord was the top of the line battery when I could clearly see other batteries with the same fit. I did not feel like I was getting quality service so I told him I would go someplace else for the battery and ask if he could help me get it started again. He walked to the back of the building and came back 5 mins later with the jump start equipment. After about a minute, he said that it wasn't going to work and he would have to get someone to jump start it with his or her car and then proceeded to help another customer. I had to ask someone in the parking lot to help me push the car to a parking space and jump start the car.

The t-shirt decorating was a good idea to kill time for those who had to wait their turn to make their glass hearts. However, there was no instructions, no introductions and no offers/ideas to help decorate the t-shirt. It was strictly go-do-it-yourself with your own brain, which was very annoying.

Babes in Arms operates with a triple bottom line philosophy (social, environmental, and financial sustainability) and offers top-quality products and advice. Part of their commitment to sustainability is their pledge to pay a living wage, and this shows in their staff. The folks who work there are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable, patient with questions and with no pressure to complete the sale (unlike some of the other high-end baby stores in town).

They offer sales and rentals of many different styles and brands of baby carriers (Ergo, Becco, Babyhawk, Boba, Maya, and Moby to name a few). You can take an extended baby-wearing class that walks you through all the options and the $10 fee (which is mostly to guarantee that folks show up) will be applied to the cost of your carrier. Rentals are also great, as they give you the chance to try options for extended periods, and come with a coupon for 10% off your carrier purchase, which effectively cuts over 1/2 off the cost of the rental.

They also offer one of the best selections of reusable diapers in town, with an eye toward sustainable, locally produced options. They have a great consignment program which lets you experiment with a range of diaper options, without spending a small fortune (which will likely still pale in comparison to the lifetime cost of disposables...but that's another story).

They offer nursing clothes for mom and locally/sustainably produced toys for dad (er, for baby), and most importantly a helpful, non-judgmental, and supportive community for parents."

I needed roman slide on wire shades for our courtyard to make the outdoor space more useable on hot afternoons and to save on cooling bills.  I took multiple bids and selected SquareD who seemed very professional and competitive. They wanted 50% up front and 50% at completion - totaling $3600 including materials. The scheduled time for the work came and went and I called multiple times and left messages about when the work could be rescheduled. Ultimately I got a call back and they showed up to do the installation. I paid once the work was complete and the installed awning looked fine to me. The following day I noticed that one of the shades had unhooked itself from the cables at one end. Not good - If one of the reenforcing tubes fell from 10 feet it could really hurt someone seriously. So I got my ladder and went up. It seems that SquareD had used S-hooks to attach the awnings to the cables - could't a bit of wind send the whole thing flying? They assured me that they had installed them this way many times and it would not be a problem. I learned the ugly truth in a few days when a 5mph wind sent the whole thing flying and metal raining down. I called SquareD and told them that the S-hooks had to be replaced with eye bolts and clip carabiners to prevent the awnings from detaching in the slightest wind.
Initially he blamed his brother who had worked on the install with him but ultimately agreed to the change if I would pay for the parts. A month went by and nothing. I called multiple times over several weeks and left messages at the business number and on the owner's mobile number. No response. Ultimately a large storm motivated me to get my ladder and take down the awnings completely - they are now in a pile in my office waiting for resolution.  I have subsequently learned that the wall anchors and cable system were not installed correctly and that I was just days from the whole thing crashing down on me and my family.  I checked deeper to claim the contractors bond and found that SquareD Awnings was registered to the previous owner and the license (and bond) expired more than a year before.  My simple advice is to stay clear of this unlicensed contractor. If I could give negative stars I would."

The choice is ours as consumers and I will no longer support a store that treats it's clientele with such disrespect and condescension.

Ensuite, ce fut une petite carte-cadeau que j'ai reГ§u pour mon anniversaire. Puis, ce fut le dГ©but d'une histoire d'amour!

Devant tant de choix, on hume les parfums et on s'y perd un peu tellement il y en a. Le personnel, trГЁs sympathique et dГ©vouГ©, viendra vous expliquer combien tout est fait Г  la main et Г  base d'Г©lГ©ments naturels. On aime!

ГЂ ma premiГЁre visite, j'avais craquГ© pour un savon, deux baumes Г  lГЁvres (celui Г  la Lime et celui, hum, au chocolat!) et un pain de massage (dont je me servais aussi comme parfum tellement il sentait bon... mais chut!).

Le temps a passГ© et j'ai un peu oubliГ© cette boutique. Un jour, j'ai rГ©flГ©chi Г  la meilleure faГ§on de ne pas avoir Г  insГ©rer ma valise dans la soute Г  bagages d'un avion et de pouvoir la garder avec moi. Il fallait que j'en rГ©duise le contenu... VoilГ  que je me suis rappelГ© les fabuleux pains de shampooing et de revitalisant de LUSH!

Ces petits pains de shampooing servent, pour certains, autant de shampooing et de savon et sont plus petits qu'une rondelle de hockey. On peut les transporter dans de petites boГ®tes de mГ©tal spГ©cialement conГ§ues Г  cet effet. Si vous ГЄtes comme comme moi, vous prendrez Г©galement une petite boГ®te pour le revitalisant. Et, dГ©trompez-vous, la taille ne veut rien dire. Cela dure aussi longtemps qu'une bouteille normale de shampooing et... c'est surtout naturel!

Quand mes valeurs rejoignent le pratique, j'adore! Les produits LUSH sont naturels et Г©cologiques. La compagnie n'utilise que des contenants rГ©utilisables! Je craque!"

efKt0pS0d83aJ5KXupy16Q,_9bnLTG6Y1YNudafT4bMgw,"Dealing with Elite Music Academy has been a disappointment to put it mildly.  I took my son for a trial lesson as I had read glowing reviews of this school over the internet.  The administration is completely unprofessional as I was booked in the wrong time slot multiple times over email and finally when we showed for the lesson, I had to email to query on the whereabouts of the teacher- who had no idea that my son was scheduled for a lesson. I had to wait an additional hour with my son for a free time slot.  If you value your time, I suggest that you look elsewhere.

If you are sent to their woodbine location, N.B that there is no 'front desk' to welcome you or to provide you additional information.  You are greeted to an open space with a few chairs on the left of the room.  I was not even sure if I was at the right place.  

Also, our 1/2 hour trial lesson was only twenty minutes.  Since this experience, I will inform prospective lesson seekers that there are other schools that offer FREE trial lessons.  This was definitely not worth the $20.

I will add that I was offered three free lessons to make up for this experience. This may sound generous; however I do value my time and I would have considered the offer if there was an alternative teacher so that both teacher and student could get off on the right start.  They did not have any alternative teacher. 

It is also my understanding that my experience is not unique but one that is characteristic of this organization- while waiting, I had the opportunity to speak with other parents who told me that the administration is disorganized, but they return because they are happy with the teachers."

Went here in December to buy a new F-150.  The sales person was nice, but really didn't know his product.  I had (and still have) several unanswered questions about the truck since I've never owned one before.

After my test ride and several hours of haggling, I was driving the new truck home.  The manager was a total stereotype looking (slick back hair, cheap suit) car pusher.  Beyond the cheesy exterior, he was nice.  However, he told me that his sales staff would gladly explain my trucks features at time of delivery.

Here's where I'm not happy.  The delivery.  I was corralled to the business office to sign the papers.  Brian, the finance manager, was nice and polite.  I paid mostly cash for the truck, so I'm sure he didn't make any money on the deal.  After leaving the business office my salesman takes me over to my new ride.  Windows dirty, stain on the seat, floor unvacuumed, he says,  ""what do you think.?""  ""I think you hired Stevie Wonder as your detailer.""  So I wait an hour for the truck to be cleaned properly.  When it finally comes around the building my salesman tells me to climb in.  He takes an hour to show me how to work the integrated phone.  Who gives a rat's a-- about the phone?!  It's a freakin' truck.  I want to know how to operate the towing package.  I bought it to pull my hot rod, not use a a phone booth.  I want to take the 4X4 and go mudding.  I don't want to take a call from God knows who!!! Needless to say after dinking with the phone for an hour, the salesman handed me the owner's manual and said, ""This will answer any other questions you might have.  I wasn't happy with the 3/4 full gas tank or the lack of follow up.  I never got a call from them to see how I liked my new truck.

I guess you get what you pay for.  Good price.  Lousy service once they have your money."

She rushed through everything.  The worst part is yet to come.  She was taking off my callouses with the callous remover (with the blade) and going as fast as she can all the while looking around not paying attention.  All the sudden I felt the slice of the razor.  She sliced my heel open and there was blood everywhere.  Blood all over the foot bath, foot pillow and towel.  She used the nippers to remove the hanging skin.  Then threw the instrument back onto the cart with the clean instruments!!  She took A bottle of ""antiseptic"", put the tip of the bottle directly on my cut and squeezed the bottle.  When she let go of the bottle the tip of it was still lodged in my cut!  ARE YOU FREAKIN' KIDDING ME?!  CAN YOU SAY HEPATITUS or STAFF INFECTION!!  GUESS WHAT??  THE IDIOT'S MADE ME PAY FOR THE SERVICE!  I knew better than to go to a ""Chop Shop""!!

Glen and his co-stylists are true artists. Whether you want something conservative or really different, you can trust their skills to make you look good. 

The salon has a welcoming, relaxing vibe. The products they use have been chosen to be as ""green"" as possible (e.g., no-ammonia hair colours).  You can tell that the neighbourhood is also very important to those at Distinct - the salon supports charitable and community events.

Prices are very reasonable too - especially for downtown. All in all, great people, great location and great value."
X7xBmi1DLl1B_JvA3dwrAw,uuGoQcIF6rOGDt4R4ohPCw,"Edited - after speaking with the owner/manager of the salon Tania, she invited me in for a full set on the house and a tube of lash growth serum. I had met with a new lash artist. She was amazing. Did a full volume set and they look great. I'm very happy I went back and gave this salon a second chance. 


So I've been seeing the same woman for awhile ( doesn't work here) who is simply amazing, and very booked up. Unfortunately our schedules didn't mesh this time. So I tried Lashious. I called and said I do 5-6d Russian volume in 15/16mm, the Lady on the phone said ""oh you know what you like and yes we can do that for you"". Normally it's $140 for a fill which is INSANE, but first time you get 50% off, naturally I was stoked on that. So I'm filling out the form, and the lady informed me their longest length was 14mm. Which wasn't what I was told on the phone, so then as I'm on the table taped up with eyes shut, I'm told they only do 3d lashes. So if you're a lash buff like me. 3d in 14mm is so much less full and dramatic than 5-6d in 15-16mm. I was so upset. They do look nice from what I can tell the technician did a good job, however they look like I already need a fill. Not as full, thick or long and dramatic as I would like. So maybe it's personal preference. But I am beyond upset that I was lied to on the phone. Nothing worse than wasting Time and money to be lied to and unhappy with your service."

X7xBmi1DLl1B_JvA3dwrAw,eoiL_d6CH84T2rnYAM0_uA,"Debating on whether or not to get eyelash extensions for an upcoming event, my girlfriend recently had her lashes done at Lashious and raved about her experience so I figured I'd give it a try.

Nestled in a converted house (the spa is the lower level of the complex), I made my way down the stairs and was warmly greeted by Tania. She went over the waiver and amenties that the spa also offered (accuncture, cupping, etc). For an additional $20, I had the option to have a leg massage during a portion of my lash application - sure, why not! 

Tania went over the different options of lashes they had to offer and after answering all the questions I had, I went with her suggestion of the silk lashes. I made myself comfortable on the spa table (cuddled up in a fluffy blanket that was offered) and Tania started the process. I really appreciated her talking me through everything she was doing - taping my lower lashes, cleaning my lashes and esp when Debbie came in for the massage. Could you imagine not being able to open your eyes and all of a sudden someone starts touching your legs/feet?! That would have scared the bejezuz outta me!

Not gonna lie, I fell asleep almost as soon as the massage started - it was so relaxing! 

The lash application did take the full 2 hours and it was totally worth it! Besides a few lashes that I've lost (due to natural shedding of my lashes), they still look as good as the day I got them done.

They currently have a promotion on where you get 50% off your first service, in addition you get 10% off your next service if you re-book right away and a referral program (10% off for each person you refer to the spa - which is stackable - 10 friends would mean 100% off!)

No question that they'll be seeing me in a few weeks time for my lash fill!"

RBEFjztls6xArCPUwX3EWA,BAlbsPtwUhfy9z5CWwRapw,"We love this product! Our customers are thrilled when they learn there is an affordable, low maintenance alternative to tile and cultured marble. 

We have noticed, homeowners are being much more selective than in years past...when it comes to choosing the right products for their Bathroom remodels. Return on investment is more important than ever. If they are going to spend the money, it is likely they will select products that hold their value. In the past, they were left with tile and cultured marble as their most affordable options. Both products look great when they are first installed...what they will look like five-years down the road is another story. ForzaStone is not only beautiful...knowing that it is designed to last a lifetime gives peace of mind to both us and our customers.

Of course practicality is important...but it should never come at the expense of the overall look of the finished product. Regardless of our customers budget and design requirements...ForzaStone has something to offer everyone. We have incorporated this product into both Traditional as well as more Contemporary designs. People are always blown away by the beauty and versatility ForzaStone offers. What impresses people most however, is that each Shower, Vanity Top or Floor, is unique...no two Bathrooms will ever look the same. 

Anyone considering an update in their Bathroom should check this product out. Not only can you create a stunningly beautiful Bathroom...you will be making a great investment in your home. 

ForzaStone's staff is also a pleasure to work with. They consistently go out of their way to offer exceptional customer service. It is obvious in dealing with them...that they believe in this product...and having used it...so do we."

The staff here were super helpful in figuring out the issue, finding the right fix and even did as much assembly of the replacement piece as they could for me. Given my slight incoherence at explaining the problem due to sleep deprivation (from being up late cleaning up the horrifying mess under my sink), they could not have been more understanding and helpful. Their prices may be a bit higher than a big box store, but I think that for anything that will require a bit of advice or instructions, they are worth the extra price.

They helped me stay still by just talking to me and when my hand was cramping up Jake (the one that did my tattoo) let me have a moment to get it out. Best tattoo parlor ever! Everyone has samples of their work hanging up in their stations which I felt gave piece of mind that no matter who gets you to do your tattoo is proud of their work and will work on it like they would want someone to work on their own.

The studio offers a range of dance styles at all skill levels and the instructors are very flexible about accommodating their students' interests.  In addition to being the best dance studio in Pittsburgh, Los Sabrosos gave me great friendships and the opportunity to explore Pittsburgh's Latin social dancing scene while having fun... highly recommended!"

They also redid the stairway to my deck ( you should see it..AMAZING!), planted shrubs and plants, and the back small deck and railings. What I really appreciated is that they only did my job. I was their client.They began and finished the job. MIchael, the owner is great to work with and want to make sure you are satisfied. I even went shopping with them to look at plants, shrubs, and materials. I definitively recommend this company."

My fiancГ© now visits on a regular schedule to get her neck adjusted. Dr. Matt has opened his doors early to help keep my back normal. Once he stayed during his lunch break to make sure I was adjusted. Dr. Matt offers traction which is pretty cool, it gets your back ready for the adjustment. I asked if I can order one for Christmas until I saw the cost. They cost like $6000.00 bucks. That's cool they offer it as part of the adjustment.

Thanks

XfxD1quRd8DhNwL1ZHwjMw,5xo6xk8e-FUV4Qs1TV4O4Q,"When it was located on Sloane it was fine.  The new location is designed to discourage foot traffic.  Only about 10 parking spots, and those are as far away as geographically possible from the doors.  If you do make it inside they actually seem to go out of their way to be inhospitable.  Our next door neighbor's teenager works there and confirmed that they were very clear to the employees that they do not want to encourage foot traffic at this new location. Their response to any complaint or expression of regret over the loss of the way things were done at the old location are to be met with a robotic smile and a ""Have a nice day.  Thank you for stopping by"".  Repeat as necessary. It was made clear to my mother's post-YMCA-exercise group breakfast club that their business was not wanted in the new location and they now go to Burger King.  

I regret the loss of the old location and won't reward the new, inhospitable way of doing things with any business, walk-in or drive-in.  It's not that much farther to go to W. 117."

They need to trim the trees so less leaves are in the pool,  somehow prevent frogs from infesting the swimming pool, and move the basketball hoop closer to the shallow so smaller kids can enjoy it without drowning.  The grounds are scary-  the tennis courts and volleyball court are almost unusable, and the changing area/showers are just gross.   The snack bar is decent though and reasonably priced."

They have all sorts of toppings for their burgers and footlong hot dogs, and they also make a big deal about their fries, which can be loaded with chili, bacon, cheese, or onions. It's standard greasy spoon kinda stuff, but pretty cheap and in a friendly (though not air conditioned) environment.

My yard is not that big, nor is it a lot to take care of, but it got out of control and I needed a fresh start without having to do the work if I must be honest. He stated it would be complete by the time I came home for lunch the next day, and when I arrived home as planned, he was correct. He even surprised me and had blown all the leaves and build up away from the entrance way. I would give it 5 stars, but there was still leaves left behind that could have been blown out.

Gj7QZ0kV-32MAVhJQsWlmg,juTsxfynZCsetwfLbgjBgQ,"Not many other Pita places out there but Pita Pit is definitely awesome when I'm looking to eat something cleaner and still on the run with my busy schedule. I wanted to put up this review specifically for this location because it's mainly where I go. First of all I do want to comment on the food. I've never had any issues with the freshness of the vegetables. They are consistently fresh regardless of what time I step foot in the place. Second, there is quite the variety of sauces you can try which I really do appreciate. Now, the main reason for this review is because I wanted to commend the gentleman who works there. I have no idea what his name is... average height Caucasian man with long-ish hair and wears glasses. He's always there (no offense) and no one else that works there looks like him.  He's worked there for a while and I don't go on a regular basis but I can always count on him greeting me with his friendly smile each and every time I walk in there. He engages in conversation and he's quick at making my pita or salad.  He's super knowledable about the menu which is also awesome. I know, I know...what's the big deal right? But now a days, with the service I've encountered at fast food restaurants. I can't appreciate them too much. So it's really comforting to know this guy seems genuine and is consistent in how he treats his customers. I don't think it's customary to tip at fast food restaurants but the tip option is on their debit/credit machine, and I am that much more apt to tip a little something with his great attitude. Dude, if you're reading this... keep up your hard work! ! and THANK YOU!"

Now what sucks it's the roaches so many roaches no matter how much poison the exterminator or yourself put down even after they smoke bomb it it doesn't do much alot of people complain about it as well these building are pretty old so it's expected to have some type of nuisance. A/C HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE. They finally worked on mine after a year or so. I complained all they did was ""clean"" the equipment and fix it. The a/c worked for the dry heat ok but as it got humud the unit just sucked. They don't keep their word on apt you will get. My first contract they told me id get an upstairs apt on a different building. Also that my apt had new tile floor already. The day comes to move in i get a piece of garbage apt with no title floor in was on the bottom floor with the look alike wood plastic floor. The previous tenant was a smoker so the apt reeked of cigarette smoke it took a while for it to kind of disappeared but it still smells. Now be prepared for water shut offs not really cascada del sol apts fault the city works once in awhile the water pipes are replaced or repairing  them. So water goes off sometimes we got the notice but not always. I wouldn't go to the pool that is all about that. A person died in one of the apts there was a shooting at one point. However in their defense i would say this area is not particularly that nice it's a little ghetto so there's homeless people that go by at night. Most people here are nice which makes this place liveable but i wouldn't recommend it unless you have to or for the sake of been close to area of work. That's my opinion about this place. One last thing the company that they use to fix the a/c left my apt completely open doors weren't locked and the person that should have stayed to lock my apartment left before the repairman even finished the work. Save yourself the hassle the BBB rating is B+ i feel they should drop it lower avoid this place. you will regret wasting your time and money."
z0tS6vm5UUricsBHyZy93g,ebM7adATj0KBbsfKl_Q3FQ,"I absolutely LOVE the staff at Cactus Dental Care.  I am 32 years old and absolutely terrified of the dentist (ranks right up there with my fear of snakes).   I avoided the dentist for 6 years but I had eventually had to go after chipping a tooth.  I will admit that when I first got there I was nervous as can be.  We started with X-rays taken by Brandy, who is one of the dental assistants, she was very professional and understanding to the fear that I had.  A few minuets later the dentist Dr. Eskanos came in.  Now in my world this man was the most horrifying man because of his profession.  As soon as I met him I knew that I was in good hands and didn't have anything to be afraid of after all how could I fear someone dressed in cartoon dolphin scrubs.  Long story short I had needed to have some work done and it was the most gentle injection of Novocain I ever had and a very pleasant drill experience.  Cactus dental and I saw each other for four weeks in a row and each time I was happy to be there.  I have my 6 month check up in January and plan on being there with bells on.  I highly recommend that if you need a dentist to try out Cactus Dental Care, you will not be disappointed.  I can say I am no longer afraid of the dentist....well at least the ones there."

juMGlVODD52yam7hCE5P7Q,iSD-cPCUFNfXkCNgTKCz5w,"Came in this afternoon for a little pick me up after beginning some Christmas shopping with the wife today. Starbucks are all pretty consistent from one shop to another.  In my experience the only time I am unsatisfied is when I get a rookie preparing my Cup 'O Joe and they make it way too weak or way too strong. Starbucks puts out a good flavored product that I can't deny. This evening I ordered a grande Veranda for myself and tall gingerbread latte for my wife. 

Staff:  
Friendly and helpful.  I needed to reload my Starbucks app and being a newbie to the Android platform on my Galaxy Note 4, I was fumbling around trying to access my account info. Thame gal behind the counter was more than patient with me and explained what I needed to do. She was quick at preparing my order for my wife and I. I noticed that she also greeted other customers and acknowledged their presence when they entered the store. 

Cleanliness. 
Floors, chairs, tables, and counters are all kept clean. I displays are neatly organized with like products rounded together. Bathrooms are clean and stocked well. All the stainless steel behind the counter was polished and sparkling. 

Outside seating:
Tables and chairs looked to be clean and in organized manner as I walked by them coming in. 

Ambience:
Today their was no music. I was kinda bummed as I look forward to listening to the indie music that is a staple to this chain of modern day urban coffee shops.  It helps to kinda wind down after a long and busy day while reflecting back. It kinda feels weird sitting here with only one other patron in the store who is working on her laptop and not having something to listen to."

nCdaVPPQ3UxpKWqM2qYnGg,9d52DhEbJQ1w5LXaZw4nzQ,"I feel bad about giving this place two stars... really.

Last sunday, my mom and I were out on a power shopping spree at the pavillions when she said she wanted to go to Souper Salad, not wanting to i begruggingly agreed. We even dug through our back seat looking for their coupon in the sunday paper for a discount! We walked up and sat down and saw their DIRTY patio furniture... wtf?! Don't these people own a hose?! That was so dirty, I couldn't imagine trying to have a nice al fresco dining experience there! Luckily for me, it was the dirtiest part of the resturant.

We approached the door when a very loud man came and opened the door and exchanged pleasantries over and over again and was very happy to see us. Ummm... thanks? but can we atleast order our drinks first? He was a little happy. I unno - I was in a good mood, but I sorta just wanted to be left alone to eat. We got our salads and the greens were semi wilted and the cesar salad needed to be refilled but didn't :( and so I was left with some odd franken salad I threw together on my own. It wasn't that great - but that's my own doing. 

Their pasta salads and cole slaw and some of their fixin's looked very old and unappetizing! I couldn't even imagine eating them! I wished they had potato salad or carrot slaw (is that the word?) and macaroni salad... it wasn't good. But things did lighten up when I came across the soups.

I loooove soups!! They are my salvation after a hard day. I cozied up to a lil bowl of tomato based soup with mini shell pasta and veggies, it was delish! So was the Veggie Beef soup. I wish it didn't have so much onion,but I'm not a big fan of onions. and their tacos were GOOOOOD... not write home and tell everyone about it good... but very good. They remind me of the kind of tacos you make at home, out of a box but not all craptastic like how they come out when I do it. I honestly liked it. 

The cornbread was dry and my mom said her baked potato was too. The pizza looked too old to touch, so I unno about that one. 

The service was another thing... the same man, who I'm assuming is the owner always kept talking. Even when my mom said something along the lines of just wanting to enjoy our meals and we thanked him for his hospitatlity. But damn... SHUT UP! I felt like he wanted to sit down and talk shop with us... but we weren't there to meet with him... we were there to talk with one another. But he always refilled our drinks and cleared our plates away quickly. So he got to keeep a star. 

To my fellow yelpers: if you're in the area and want fresh salads, this might not be the place for you... especially if you want to eat outside cafe style on nice clean patio furniture... but if you want a nice cozy bowl (or several like me) of soup and decent bread sticks then this place will hit the spot. You might need to shoo away the owner though in order to get some privacy and enjoy the people you arrive there with."

iDTIUgQy59uCcdMVEtKgEQ,cWrKYLp_pSiWA-gJ21GeBg,"Want to kick it old school cafeteria style? Then you've found your place. Located on the third floor of West Canadian Place, this cafeteria is everything you'd expect from a cafeteria, hairnets and all.  Their main ""hot food"" area offers things like daily special of a macaroni casserole or Salisbury steak. They also have a deli area for a selection of sandwiches, a soup area and a small salad bar. There are also a couple of refrigerated case - one with pre-made salads and sandwiches and the other with sushi.

The cafe itself is pretty crowded and in a U shape. I went for a late lunch (after 12:30) and it was still quite busy. I can only imagine it is pretty packed earlier. They have a few tills though so paying moves fairly fast. The forks and cutlery are out in the ""lobby"" area where there is ample soft seating and tables of varying height, some overlooking the building lobby below. It is a bit noisy so this would not be a place to escape with a book at lunch.

The Terrace Court Cafe does a decent job of everyday, simple, comfort food lunches and there is likely something for everyone. Their prices are reasonable compared to other downtown lunch options. It's not fancy but lunch doesn't need to be fancy every day, does it?"

It was clean, it was NOT overstocked, they had everything you would ever need to take care of your feather friend. They also weren't pushy or over bearing. I was greeted by the friendly staff, and left to browse their beautiful birds. When I was ready to pick my little sweetheart, they got her out and put her in a carrier(which I did not think to bring), they helped me get the her current chow, and they told me about her age and temperament. The cherry on top was that they clipped her little nails and flying feathers for me at no extra charge. I strongly recommend you come to the Bird Nest for any and all your bird needs!

After a long hard day of jean shopping. I was about to give up on life itself.  I was about to go home with nothing after spending 4 hours looking in three different stores on Queen St.  I was walking to my car and the window display caught my eye.  It was Deluxe.  I totally forgot it was the store I came across in the winter-- but to my delight, this time I had some money to spend and I AM SO HAPPY.  

The pieces in this store and classic and pieces you can wear forever.  I love the owner, she's real and has incredible style and is very beautiful.  Rather than rummaging through a bunch of crap at the mall, i found my one stop shop. I love it here :) Will be coming again!"

Atmosphere:
The interior of Manzen looks pretty awesome, very nice decor, although kinda small. Manzen I'm told gets a lot of take out orders. Felt nice and warm inside, people are nice and friendly. 

Food: 
High quality, very nicely presented dishes. They mainly serve rolls/sushi/sashimi and there is a lot of variety to those. Mazen's food tastes as good as it looks, very flavorful. Fish tastes fresh, bright vibrant colours to dishes. We got the white fish roll (forgot the name) but man, it was good!  

Service:
They actually have a japanese waitress!, A lot of japanese joints are overrun by chinese people, which is okay but sometimes... doesn't feel authentic just copied over. Friendly service, and two chefs there are also very friendly.

They designed the whole system from complete electric throughout the house, full lighting placement, and finally a very complicated control 4 system with complex audio, video, security and full house automation.  They were/are always on time, very responsive(available all hours of the day) and stand behind their products.  Because of the size of the project, we have had to come back to them to help fix or tweak things that were faulty(from the manufacturer) and they continue to back their products.  This continues to be our favorite part of the new build and I would highly recommend them.  Extremely honest company and people to do work with."

They do not do returns only exchanges within 7 days and instead of being told that simply is company policy I was told it was because they are bathing suits and it was due to hygiene. I am not sure how it differs if I return a bathing suit vs. exchange a bathing suit they are still getting a RETURNED bathing suit???? I asked the clerk after I exchanged it what will she now do with the bathing suit I just exchanged, she answered she doesn't know. It was the most frustrating experience ever, so now I have a mediocre overpriced bathing suit for the season I cannot wait!

Two nights in a row, 15 minutes before this specific shop closed, this location didn't want to serve anyone in any way involving effort.

The night before, on my way to work, I stopped by with the intent of getting a Frapp to go. I was told, ""I'm sorry. We turned our blenders off for the night. Can I offer you a tea or some coffee or something?"" I politely declined and left.

The next night, I came by about the same time. Staff were inside. I could see them. I tried the door and it was locked. There was NO SIGNAGE WHATSOEVER explaining why they had closed up early. The staff ignored me.

Why should I find out if a third time's the charm? I asked Starbucks staff at a DIFFERENT location WITHOUT implicating anyone. ""If you need to close your shop early for some reason and lock the doors, do you put signs up explaining this?"" They said of COURSE they do so people understand they're not simply lazy and wanting to quit work early. I then recounted being told that the blenders had been shut off so they couldn't make a Frapp for me. The staffer smirked and whispered, ""They bullshitted you. They just didn't want to have to do any work at the end of the day. Sounds like these guys don't want to work very hard.""

This was said to me by staff from a DIFFERENT Starbucks. ACTUAL STARBUCKS STAFF, not just my friends I'm passing off as staff or an outright lie all together.

Since you don't want my money, you won't be getting it, and I'm a DAMNED LOYAL Starbucks customer. You won't be getting my friends' money, either.

That's ok. That would've required you to WORK. Now you can goof off like you want at the end of the day without worrying some rando will come bother you. Good luck with that."

Warning: if you go here be sure to write down all your instructions. 

I brought in two garments to be tailored. We discussed what to do for them both, for one he offered his opinion on what to do. I listened to his input but was clear that I'd rather my original request be honoured.

When I went to pick it up my heart sank as I saw that he didn't do what I had asked. I thought there must have been a misunderstanding... that is until I heard him say, ""See I didn't do what you wanted, and it looks good, no?"" I matter-of-factly responded with, ""Well it's not what I asked for, but I can't do anything about it now.""

Then, when I got home I saw the other garment wasn't completed. I took it back that day and explained what was missing. I was set in absolute shock as I heard him say, ""You never asked me to do that."" He then made it as if he was doing me a favour and begrudgingly finished the garment.

------

By this time I, unfortunately already had other items with him. 

When I went to pick those up I made sure to try them on in-store. Again, I found that he had not tailored them to my specifications. I brought this to his attention and he said, verbatim, ""Well this is your fault because you told me to do it that way."" I was absolutely appalled at his response - not only was it immature and unprofessional, it was wrong.

Thankfully he corrected the garments, but not without giving me an attitude about it.

-----

The last straw was when I went to pay. Upon drop-off I had asked him for a quote so I'd know what to expect the expense to be. Upon pickup he charged me 35% more!

-----

I gave him the stars I did because the actual work, once finally competed was fine. However, to me, it wasn't worth the frustration of getting it there. 

I certainly won't be going back as I don't take my business to people who treat me like crap. I don't advise you to either unless you'd like the same treatment."

Called again today, and was told they were very busy and it might be a few weeks yet before they could call to book an appointment again....what? Seriously...a two second phone call to book an appointment for an estimate...where's the focus on customer service.    Guess they don't want my business.

If a companies front end experience is this bad, imagine what the follow through would be like in delivering what they promise when they take your money.  This lack of commitment to customer service at first point of contact is a serious red flag in any business. 

Perhaps they should consider saving the cost of the pricey mail drop ads they deliver to my house every month, and redirect those funds into a customer service position.  Why bother paying for such frequent advertising when you aren't set up or interested in handling the business when it responds to your ad????"

On May 10th which is 2 weeks after the agreed date of delivery I sent them an email asking if the bees were ready for pick up, they answered back saying that due to inclement weather they had problems with their queens and that it was going to take about two more weeks on top of the already existing delay, and that they would contact me when the Nuc is ready within about two weeks.
On June 4th (4 weeks later) I sent them another email asking for the Nuc and if it was available, they answered on june 7th saying that they had problems with their queens but that they would have some Nucs ready for pick up on June the 11th, if I could be there at 7pm.
On June the 11th I called honeyhive farms and spoke with Tim Moore I believe the owner of the farm, I asked him if the 2month delay would take a toll on the overall health and wellbeing of the hive as I'm new to the Midwest and I was originally expecting to get an extra frame or couple of frames of bees to compensate for the delay, but a simple ""we are sorry for the delay I Insure you that the bees will make it"" would have been enough. 
Instead he said in a quite rude way ""I can also refund your money, I have hundreds of people interested in bees and I'm not going to be sweating for one hive"" which I found to be disrespectful and told him so, and that I don't think that is the way to treat a costumer you've failed to satisfy. I am from Bolivia and I have a heavy accent, which lead Mr. Moore to say that he also has a set of rules which are:
First: He does not do business with people from Texas.
Second: He does not do business with people who are not from the United States.

After that I asked him directly: so its not just a lack of seriousness doing business, but  you are also discriminating me out of my accent?, and he said yeah sorry I have to stick to my rules.

So Texans, Immigrants and serious adults interested in doing business, stay away from Honey Hive farms"

He said ok and my truck would be done at 2pm.
So I get no call from him and arrive to pick up my truck at about 2:45pm.
So I walk in and ask him how everything went and he tells me that he couldn't do the front end alignment. That I needed a ballpoint and a tie rod end. So I'm like why didn't you call me and tell me this.
He says that he didn't have time to do all that work. And that I needed a break hose too and it wasn't even safe to drive home.

Since moving in to my apartment there have been non-stop work orders needing to be processed with repair issues arising. This started the day I moved in and has been on going with the most recent, a major flood that happened from the upstairs unit into my unit with significant water damages throughout. As I am writing this all they have done so far is placed fans to air the place out and I do believe they will just paint over it which is not the proper way to handle a major flood in the ceilings and walls and also flooring. The flood happened a couple of weeks ago and I am occupying my place. The time frame for correcting issues via work order processing is longer and overall, this place was a very bad experience to say the least. Additionally, when moving in, my place had been occupied by a smoker and I am not a smoker so I had to deal with fans being set up in my apartment to try to air out everything in which it really never did as my place still smells like cigarette smoke, and they used my electricity that spiked on my invoices to do this and never reimbursed me either. Lastly, the noise is bad. My upstairs neighbors fight day and night and you can hear them throwing things including things off of their balcony. You can hear music and yelling. They are actually the cause of the flood that transpired. There is also some crime going on frequently in this community. I would highly recommend to NOT moving in to River Birch Apartment Homes, unless you enjoy living with work order issues non-stop and having your life disrupted often....."

I can't speak highly enough of Megan's Zumba classes and Cate's Group Personal Training classes. The yoga that precedes the Zumba is the perfect low-intensity warm-up too. I've been coming here for about two months (with a 2 1/12 week break in between because of travel), and i don't see myself stopping any time soon - I've lost 10 pounds already (combined with diet, of course). I feel more energetic, and I actually look forward to the classes (something I've NEVER done - I've always hated going to the gym and having a personal trainer). The fact that classes are a group of women (and a few men), all of whom are just trying to better themselves rather than compete with and judge each other, is fantastic. The classes all have 'levels' so workouts are about pushing yourself, but not about feeling like shit because your body just can't do certain things. In fact, I enjoy the way my body feels so much in these classes that I've started to work out at the gym in my condo on my own time - something I never thought I'd do! I highly, highly, highly recommend this place. It really has given me a new appreciation for my body and the things it can do :) Thanks Suzanne, and everyone at Fitzone Plus!

tis5ph0vBF78jypC1eVZow,K2d4GwR0WaPn1d6mSJ34Vg,"Ages ago, this Pizza Hut takeout location used to be a dine-in restaurant across the parking lot (which is now a Japanese restaurant). I don't think it was ever really busy enough to require so much seating, so they moved into a smaller place for just takeout and delivery. We've tried all the pizza chains, and for some reason we prefer this one. Personally, I think they're all pretty similar, but Pizza Hut does offer some good variety and some good deals and customization possibilities if you use their website. One of the best pizzas I ever had from a chain was when I ordered something through their website. That was a 4-star pizza. 
Tonight I ordered the Health Check Margherita Pizza and the Health Check Chicken Arrabiata. (Note to self: ""arrabiata"" must mean ""spicy"" because it was covered in crushed chili peppers. Should have gone with the chicken rustico instead.) The Margherita pizza was on a thin multigrain crust, and it's supposed to have less mozzarella cheese, but it seemed to have a ton, which made for a greasy and soggy, but great tasting pizza. The best part of the pizza was the tomatoes covered in garlic pesto. Which is why I went with the arrabiata, I thought the pesto would be great too, but it was drowned out by the chili peppers. 
The service is quick, the lineups are short, the food is often good, and it's close by. We haven't tried the  WingStreet wings, but there was a $15 pizza and wings special that we might try next time."

I base that off of my personal experience over the last 8yrs of having my family of 6 seen at this office. the sheer number of people sitting in the waiting room at once is alarming. We have been coming here for 8 yrs and it's gotten worse every year.  We loved it in the beginning. We have finally decided to switch for good after seeing the decline of patient care over the years. 

You never actually see a Dr, just a PA who will get on their cell phone and Google medications and diagnosis's. They spend very minimal time with you and you feel them rushing you. They double and triple book constantly. For example:  We wait in the waiting room for over an hour every time.  meanwhile we find out the people sitting next to us were booked with the same PA for the exact same time.... which reveals why we all wait so long. They are trying to see as many people as they can as quickly as they can to make more money.  

My son has an ongoing prescription for a controlled substance that you have withdraws from and they don't work properly if not taken everyday as prescribed.  I have to pick up his script every month because it is a controlled substance and the front staff fails to put in the request to the ""PA"" each time... and when I say each time, I mean EACH TIME! My son has gone weeks without his Meds because the PA/nurse or front office staff fails to either get the request to the Dr or they are ""too busy"" to look at their files. I can't tell you how many hours I have wasted calling their office asking if the prescription was ready! It's unacceptable! My son truly has suffered because of it.  I've gone in before when they said it would be ready at a certain time and it wasn't.   I would have to LEAVE  and drive back hours or days later because they are so unorganized and so busy from the sheer number of people they see daily to actually care for the patients all the way through.  They don't make sure they are getting adequate care and follow through even when I have complained m, it never improved.  It's like herding cattle in the office. It's not about the patients, it's about the money! 

For parents that don't vaccinate they will give you a hard time, and push the issue. He is absolutely not supportive of people who want to do their own vac schedule for their kids. They don't  think twice about offering meds (especially the meds that they get a bunch of free samples from, from the pharmaceutical companies) before alternative natural methods, because again ""money"". 

I didn't see Dr. Diaz often in the last few years, but when I did he was very flirtatious and touchy feely.  Definitely didn't get a ""professional"" feel and made me feel very uncomfortable when alone with him. 

Suddenly they went from doing Family medicine to now they do a bunch of beauty treatments and injectables. It's just bizarre how all over the map they have become and all the new products they push. To me it tell me they are just trying to make money in every area they can  instead of being really good and dedicated to just one thing. When we started years ago, it was about Family medicine and you can feel the difference.  

As you can see, I'm not someone who writes reviews, but this has been so unacceptable and disheartening and after talking to them SEVERAL times (including Dr Diaz) with no change, I had to write a review.   it's expensive to start up with a new Dr and if you're a parent like me, you will need to be informed so you can make the right decision for your families needs. I want to minimize the headache for people looking for a Dr who actually sees their patients and has complete follow through with an outstanding back office staff.  This isn't it. I sincerely hope it changes and they turn things turn around for the patients sake.  We all deserve good, professional Dr's."

Mills and Mills responded to our daughter's call within minutes!  They calmed her down and gave excellent advise on how to handle it with the school's assigned police officers and school officials.  When my daughter called me at work to say ""I called my lawyer today"" I was first scared of the why and then felt at ease because I knew LegalShield was there for my daughter when she needed them.

I explained to the lady here where I planned to put the plant and how much light etc it would get. I told her the plants I liked but instead of lying to me and saying these expensive plants would work she pointed me to less expensive plants and explained that they would thrive in the described situation. Sure it was a bit disappointing to not be able to get the specific plants I had in mind but it would be awful to buy plants and have them die quickly. 

I will be back to this place because they obviously care about customer satisfaction and they are knowledgeable about their products."

I did take out so I can't speak to the service. I tried a combo plate of 8 nigiri sushi and a green dragon roll, as well as some seaweed salad. Everything was good, and while I was picking up my meal I saw the chefs preparing some sushi pizza which also looked amazing. It's a bit strange that two sushi places just opened up right next to each other (Manzen and Sushi on Gerrard), but regardless Manzen is a great addition to the hood. Last thing, the miso soup was nice, I don't like miso, but this one had some nice fresh ingredients in it, maybe bamboo shoots?"

GOOD STUFF:  The Ritz Carlton used to have great sushi...if the other reviewer (Cheeky T.) is right that its the same sushi chef that's a definite plus.  I've been twice....both times really good sushi at fairly cheap prices.  Nice place too with good location in Ohio City.  Most importantly they let me BYOB which I absolutely love.

BAD STUFF:  I recently called there and they were closing early so turned me down for a take out order...worried that this place may not make it and you can't close down early when you're a restaurant....

PRICE:  fairly cheap especially if you go BYOB

OVERALL:  The best sushi place I have found so far in downtown or the west side of Cleveland.  BYOB if you ask nicely and really solid sushi.  Worried about the closing early thing...I hope they make it."

I ordered a calzone, and it was mostly rock hard dense crust- maybe 5 square inches of filling- which was a glop of cheap runny ricotta right out of the container, without even a bit of egg or grated cheese to bind it- a tiny amount of cheese and no onions as ordered. I guess the steak strips were so tough because it was overcooked.

   I ordered zucchini fries- pencil thin, burnt batter and I had difficulty finding anything resembling zucchini inside them. I threw them away.
 The marinara was canned Hunt's spagetti sauce- which I swear someone threw a bunch of dried oregano and garlic salt in raw- inedible. Into the garbage it went too.

   I also ordered what passes for a gyro from a fast food place in Pittsburgh- frozen identical slabs, exactly as expected. (There ARE real off the spit gyro places in Pittsburgh-not a slam on my town.) 

   The tzaziki sauce was the generic garlic powder/""yogurt"" (and fillers) from a tub kind.
    Also, they forgot my ranch on the side- but didn't forget to charge me for onions and sauce.
  
   Just a careless half-assed and disappointing experience and I will never be ordering from them again, even though they're 1/4 mile away."

Someone with a band size of 32 is not plus size, something she, a bra fitter, should know. This didn't exactly give me overflowing confidence in her abilities to help me find a properly fitting bra.

Skip this office as the staff there are totally incompetent.  They can not tell the truth, they don't listen, they evidently don't keep proper records, and you can not rely on anyone to call you back. You have to rely on no response because most times they don't answer the phone.  The wife has just got off a call with them trying to get a medication refilled that they already told her had been taken care of a month ago.  Not! Every one you speak to has a different version of what went wrong and no one cares.  She started out over a month ago in preparation for a continuing series of shots (only twice a year) that she has been taking for the last three years or so.  They actually told her last week that the prescription she was asking about was not even on her medical records.  Really!  Why does it take over a month and still no prescription?  Still waiting for a phone call back from them.  The person on the phone today actually said they were ""confused"", well that makes you feel good about your healthcare doesn't it.

Once she gets this medication out of the way we are changing doctors again and leaving this nice doctor with his totally incompetent staff."

Besides the fact that my body has more muscle then this girl did, only difference I got into an accident and couldn't work out.  

Other then that, their equipment is standard, and I was told someone would show me how to properly use the equipment so I don't you know, hurt myself and then they basically forgot that they promoted that as a free service and yet again tried to get me to shell out more money for a trainer.  I came in and tried to cancel my contract, and they put me through the ringer and then this asshole who was unbelievably rude, and beyond civilized told me there's no way they will cancel my membership, that I had 11 days to end the contract and it was day 12, just so you know, as I've now learned you can get out of any contract within 11 days.  

So I felt screwed..  but sorry, not going down like that... So I asked the guy who signed me up why he didn't tell me that I had 11 days to cancel and he said ""why would I, I'm not going to tell you how to quit your membership""... after that bullshit I knew this place was a scam, so I made a friendly Sunday night phone call to the CEO or something like that on his private number and explained all this.. he immediately told me he would refund my money and look into this situation (because even the contract I signed didn't say that I had 11 days to cancel which is apparently what all their contracts have to say) I doubt he did, but my check was waiting there for me, I was so happy to get the hell out of there.  So many people told me there is no way... they don't know who they are talking to.  Do not waste your time with this establishment, or if you do, remember those 11 days.

I came in to see a friend of a friend's stand up routine the other night.  This spot gets a variety of local and traveling talent.  The room is small but not cramped, and clean enough.  

The crowds here are the issue I have.  Mostly seniors (seniors seniors!), they didn't really buy into the acts on stage.  The host was pretty brutal, but the two headliners were funny enough.  

I felt bad for the comedians because if you took most of the crowd out of the room, put them in a nursing home in front of a TV w/ some Matlock and jello, they'd be right at home.  They were not laughing or interested in the acts on stage, I think they were there for seats, literally the seats, just to sit and fight the urge to nap.

Once dried, the bubbles were more pronounced than initially. I came back the next day to have them redone, and the same thing happened again.  I asked them to remove the polish and I left. Fast forward to a few days ago, I was in need of a pedicure, drove to a few different nail places but they weren't open yet so I gave Romantic Nails a try yet again ONLY because they were open and I was impatient. I told the owner, who was doing my pedi that I wanted my toenails to remain square-shaped.  Well, she end up using the cuticle cutters to shape my nails and totally cut the edges/sides down so they were very rounded.  When I noticed, I became upset and told her I didn't want them rounded. she basically told me they had to be rounded so I didn't get ingrown nails.  I haven't had an ingrown nail in 40+ years and they'd been square the whole time.

And I thought if it's going to cost me $80 or more it's got to be worth it! Well... Not so much. So very disappointing, my fault I should have said something while I was there. Not sure why I didn't. My major issue was the fact that there were limited products for the application... There was no foundation that matched my skin tone and thus a mix of two extreme color were blended and applied... It was probably two shades lighter than my complexion. I could barley see the colors applied to my eyes. Usually my makeup session lasts about 45 mins to an hour...

Even though it is up and down with service, I am always greeted with a smile and they acknowledge me by first name. The ladies are very sweet and friendly. 

I have taken my little sister for a pedicure date, and as she has tiny clean feet they usually do a nail design or something for free. 

Overall, it was decent enough for me to keep returning (as well it was mostly out of convenience since I never made appointments and would just walk in as it was close to where I lived) but now I definitely on the look out for a new place."
Tl0_JsPz8B3I-opvSZXRGg,ymnrRLQ4TO-lyJfqCdwRMA,"I LOVE this cool little cafe!  It is pretty new (only been open a few months) and not well known yet, which may explain the previous reviewer's experience of being the only one in the store.  I spoke to the friendly staff...it is a family owned shop, and yes, everything is super fresh.  In fact, Jennifer grows some of the herbs that go into the tabouli herself!  

I believe the prices are incredibly fair.  I've gone a couple times and ordered the Cure, and my husband got a hot steak sandwich.  Both were very delicious and the special jams and cheeses are definitely not on hand at my home (The Cure = ham, honey almond brie, butter lettuce, red onion jam on a croissant for $6.50)!  We have also ordered coffees and teas, which are cheaper than Starbucks!  Their variety is great!  So many flavors, extra shots are only 50c, and Jennifer helped me choose my perfect drink each time.  Today it is a refreshing green tea with peach, and was delivered straight to my table.  

I give this place 5 stars for excellent service, freshness, and cleanliness.  Oh, and as I'm writing this here, the free internet is noticeably FAST (also faster than at Starbucks or other cafГ©s I've been).  I would recommend this mom and pops cafe to anyone, especially if you're looking for a peaceful and friendly place away from the hustle and bustle of other busy coffee shops where tables with outlets and a quiet corner without loud music are hard to find :)"
iBG3YSJ_rdDInBD4d3CZrA,9DAH67LbbbvymJwzlHFl8w,Horrible. Not sure why they only have two tellers. Maybe it's because there is no customers??? Neither one will answer drive thru and your wait can be ten plus mins. With no one letting you know anything. And if you complain and call the customer service number they will tell you everything under the sun and make all these promises. But nothing changes. Been to this location many times. All different hours of the day all on different days of the week. Just horrible!
wTX2CUll6hVnvXNPpwqQSw,dgrLY96AY68Go1uOA-guiA,"UNSAFE TRUCK - DO NOT EVER RENT FROM BUDGET on 67th AVE and BELL ROAD in Glendale, AZ. The truck they rented me had SAFETY ISSUES and they did NOT care. I called and made them aware that the passenger mirror that would not stay in place for longer than a few miles and they blew it off. Well, the problem persisted on my 300 mile trip and I had to stop several times to get out and adjust it again only to have it not stay after a few miles. (Yes, I tried duct tape) Ok, so, anyone can rent a moving truck - what if it was someone who had never driven large vehicles (or on an interstate), towed trailers, etc??? Someone would have been hurt or died!!! Not to mention the other issues such as the alignment problem I had to overcompensate for the whole trip. 
Compared to the afore mentioned, the other inconveniences such as disgusting filth, smell, non working interior light, non working usb charger, no radio if you did try to charge.. is small stuff. Seriously, DO NOT rent here. I'm pursuing every avenue I can to file a complaint and make people aware of their nonchalant attitude regarding safety - they put at least one UNSAFE truck on the road - not acceptable - one too many. 
Oh, and the $10 off the bill? Really? That's it? They could have refunded the entire bill and I would still post this because it is UNSAFE!!! I would love to see maintenance records, an inspection report, what an independent mechanic would say today about this truck. Totally unacceptable and their lack of concern over safety is very disturbing. 
Stick with UHAUL and Penske even if the rates are higher. Go with SAFETY first for yourself, your loved ones and everyone else on the road."

pI2UxM0VnWbrFauLEXXXcg,HiczeW-O7iVydswtVmUhSw,"I have mixed opinions on this place. I don't know what to make of it honestly.  It is sometimes packed where you can't move or get a drink and other times its dead and they close off half the bar with a curtain.  The drink service has been either good or non-existent. The only consistency would be that the co-ed bathrooms suck and are just a good place for people to do drugs, the bouncers are very rude and unhelpful, and the prices are expensive. On the plus side I quite enjoy the music and the decor and its one of the few place in Calgary you can get dressed up for. So like I said, a mixed bag.  TIP: If you're booking a table be warned that they purposely tell everyone to arrive at 10:30pm to create a long line up to make the place look cool.  This results in a long wait and lots of confusion about why the people paying max dollar for tables have to wait in a long line. I think every bar in Calgary does this now though. Such a scam. And don't expect the bouncers or staff to be nice about it."

I stayed at the same office, always thinking about finding her new location. I finally did and I wish I had chosen to look her up sooner. I believe this is how a visit at the dentist is supposed to be - for the initial visit she takes an hour of her time to walk you through everything. She's very knowledgeable, friendly and gets straight to the point.The staff is very considerate and friendly. I highly recommend to ditch your current dentist if you're not 100% happy with them and to find Dr Lee. You'll be glad you did!"
1E_eW5CEreL45KjNbRGjtA,LZSQapv22bg0uxK11hoQcQ,I bought a machine from Dupray and they assured me it would be great in a detail shop to clean the exterior. Once I received the machine it did not hold pressure long enough to clean the exterior as Dupray said it would. I returned the machine and had to pay $170 to ship it back with insurance and $458 for return fees. Dupray claims then guarantee satisfaction and have hassle free returns. This was not the experience I had. Dupray did nothing to try and make me happy and did not want to fix the problem. . I then went to their youtube videos to share my situation  because the videos do not show the whole car being cleaned only sections.  I was blocked from their youtube and my comments were deleted and now ratings on youtube have been disable for their videos. This company sold me a machine deceptively and continue to do so by removing negative comment from the public.

We also used their photo booth services and it provided a great entertainment for our guests. The set up for the photo booth was very impressive and the props were fun. Also, the staff manning the photo booth did not hesitate to print out extra photos upon request, were super friendly and polite.

Clean, modern , and prompt service. Keurig in the lobby , men's and women's restrooms, and a soda vending machine . There is also a flat screen TV in the waiting area,  which is large and roomy, with good air conditioning and a nice view out front.

The workers wear uniforms and were neat , clean and properly groomed , unlike some places I have seen.

Oh they politely agreed to check a problem I have with a power window although they were booked solid today. 

Although my service was very basic, I give them 5 stars for very professional service because I overheard them handle a very difficult emotional customer. She was making unreasonable demands on them about her fried clutch on a three-week-old transmission she got here. The manager explain that the car was test-driven fine before she left with it that day but they saw the husband smoking rubber with this car on State Route 14. Since the clutch is already fried and they saw him misuse it, they could not honor their labor warranty for it. The same customer had told me her story and her husband is in his seventies with some difficulty in judgment so no longer fixes his own cars.

The manager and crew handled this volatile situation calmly and professionally , which is what I expect from a small business."

She has always put us at ease with her warm personality as well as her knowledge of how to make a photo shoot feel natural from the start. 

Emily has done a wonderful job taking our photos in different environments. When we receive the photos, we cannot wait to see her artistic point of view.  We are always thrilled with the end result!  Emily has provided us with photos that truly encompass the feeling of the moment.

hm_9fXPdQgPffJP5btjVbg,C97XNBgGjiSUChUSPloYlQ,"I am a man that lives alone, so having to clean the house on my own would be a nightmare. I love the convenience of not doing anything (except paying :)) and getting my home cleaned professionally. 
Major positives: extremely convenient and overall great service. Love the feeling of coming home to a nicely cleaned house. I also enjoy the fact that they change the bedsheets with fresh ones - I hate doing it myself so this is another weight off my shoulders. I like the fact that they report anything damaged and have been able to discuss it with the managers and have it reimbursed within reason. This keeps my mind at ease especially having strangers in my house. The fact that the workers are fully bonded and insured is a big plus. 
Some recommendations: Because of the speed required to go through a home cleaning, a lot of my personal items are not placed back in the same spot after being moved. It takes me 15-20 minutes when I get home to get my stuff back where it should be (I need my things in order). While I understand that doing this will take time away from a more thorough cleaning, I do prefer that my personal items will be approximately in the same spot (give or take - I don't have OCD). Occasionally some spots remain untouched, again because of the speed, but that is more rare and hasn't really bothered me too much. 
Recommendation: Generally I have been very open to recommending merry maids. The main pushback I get from my friends/family is that they are still set on the old school private lady that comes in and cleans the house. Their argument is that they are cheaper (cash pay) and they take their time to go really thoroughly through the entire house. Individual private ladies have their own drawbacks, including slow service (most of them take much much longer, effectively bugging you with their presence), are not bonded and insured, and have generally not cared much if they broke anything (""was already broken""). I recommend Merry Maids to anyone because I am very pleased with the service."

There response was, we should have left a message Sunday night, when nobody is even there. They would have received the message the next day anyway. What is the difference Sunday night or before start of business?  Either way they would have to fill the appointment at the last minute.

7mPa7HVCfOkaE3GIFiTWgw,iKY3V8ieSeOG1nUcGZ4WXA,"WFM Restoration was recommended by my highly-trusted plumber, but I was initially hesitant as they are a fairly new company and I could not locate reviews on them. As my insurance company was not happy with the quality of work done by my previous restoration company, I met with Raul and allowed him to explain the process and how his company was different from other companies. It turned out to be the best decision that I could make! The crew leaders (both with over 20 years experience) quickly arrived and took time to resolve my fears, ensure my comfort, and get to work. The water damage was substancial (about two-thirds of my home) and had reached farther into my home than I realized. They took time to show me the damage, explain what/why they were doing what they did, and quickly work to dry out my home and prevent any further damage. I appreciated the updates and the fact that they did what they needed to do, but did not remove excess drywall or shelves and only opened up one side of a wall whenever possible. The crew went above and beyond, addressing poorly-done clean ups left behind by another company, and even cleaning a mess left on my patio by the landscapers. Their own work was impeccable, and I was amazed by how neatly they left everything. I cannot praise the work crew enough! Every single crew member made me feel as if they cared about the well-being of family and home. I did have a misunderstanding over a small portion of the bill that was caused by miscommunication between myself, my insurance agent, Raul, and the employee responsible for accounting. In honesty, the accounting employee and I were on completely different wavelengths, and we were both extremely frustrated with one another until I realized that his claim (the point of our dispute) was valid. I was wrong, yet we both ended up taking responsibility for it. Raul knew the dispute was settled, but he still took time to reach out to me, assure me that he understand why I thought as I had, and offer me support to ensure that the next phase (reconstruction) was successful. In fact, he offered a type of support due to my specific circumstances that I doubt any other company would. Raul's handling of my dispute speaks volumes about the standards and integrity that he is putting into his business. One other point: they are an emergency water/fire etc. mediation company. They do outstanding work (insurance-company approved!) in that field, but they do not have a contractor's license. I mistakenly (based on my previous experiences) thought I had to wait and use venders selected by them etc. for the reconstruction process. They provide assistance (thank you Maria!) finding suitable venders, setting up appointments, contacting insurance companies, etc. as a courtesy to help their clients, but this is part of their above and beyond (my words) service. They strongly encourage you to ask questions, and I recommend it especially if relying on previous experiences. I truly believe WFM is in a class of their own."

Recently, there is a pipe leak in our wall and we are sleeping in the living room everyday. They left us a hole in the wall, and chemical smell bedroom.

The place is similar to a Cafe Rio or Chipotle model of ordering. You first pick your dish then follow it down the line to customize it as you wish.  There's three things that stood out to me the couple times I've been here.  The first was the very energetic and quick footed staff. They are all smiling and seem to be happy to see the customers lining up and making them run up and down the line.  The second is the time factor, I like most people that will visit this place on a weekday for lunch work or spend a lot of time downtown.  So I need to be in and out pretty fast to be able to enjoy my meal and get back to work or finish any other errand before my lunch hour is up.  Since they hustle and  move and also have a menu that for the most part is pretty standard it allows me to get in and out in under 6 or 7 minutes even when the line has been 3 or 4 customers deep.  The 3rd and final is of coarse THE FOOD.  I've been here 4 times and haven't tried the entire menu but so far the chicken and steak have been satisfying and left me wanting more!  Give it a try!"

This was a month ago still waiting. She is condescending and tries to make you look and feel stupid when she doesn't agree with you. Always took forever for maintenance to go do a shitty job at fixing things 
Our heater unit didn't even have a regulation door and they didn't even bother to change it just said to leave it a little open!!! 
Our apartment flooded 4 times and it took them forever to act on that too!! 
Then they wonder why we wanted out be out of there ASAP 
More likely than not there's mold everywhere they didn't even bother testing when we asked 
Where the heating unit is it was always damp or wet!

iq9f_d3hcb_1ddIECHaXeQ,1_120oX-hqzvYbZWj3CSXA,"I would give this clinic and my doctor ZERO stars if I could. I will say that the staff up front are relatively polite. I was never treated rudely by anyone up front. However, After waiting 40 minutes past my appointment time I decided to ask one of the girls how long until I saw the doctor. She proceeded to tell me that ""the doctor is running just a little behind"" which I then responded back ""40 minutes is not a little behind and want to know how long till I see the doc"". She looked at me as if I was an alien and how dare I ask that question. It seems that waiting an unacceptable long amount of time is now the norm hence her flippant attitude about my wait time.

I had the typical battery of tests at my second visit. The ultrasound girl, her name escapes me now, was not rude but certainly did not put me at ease. She was very cold and just ""did her job"" Not a horrible experience but certainly would have preferred someone with a personality.

Long story short, had scheduled a time to come back for my results and would't you know it, they called to tell me that I would have to come back in to have the ultrasound redone because they could not find my records!

The second round for the tests I took and were done by a gentleman who was polite, attentive and had a great attitude. By the way the guy that handled the test for the large machine they put me in was also very nice and made me feel very comfortable. Thumbs up to both of them. The doctors in this office could learn a few things from these guys with regard to human interaction with others.

My doctor is a pathetic excuse for someone with a Phd. Dr Shehane has the personality of a rock. At my second appointment he came in to let me know what my test results were. His bedside manner was rushed, not informative and he had quite a sarcastic attitude when i started to ask questions about my results. It appeared that he was more concerned with getting to the next patient, and there were plenty, than deal with my concerns. After walking me to one of the nurses stations to proceed to get discharged, he just tells me to have a seat and then walks off. No handshake, no, ""hey thanks for coming in, not even a ""have a good day"". None of the niceties that any human being would give to another human.

i decided to fire this doctor and reschedule with a different doctor from a different cardiology group. I asked to have my records faxed over so that the new doctor would have the test results. 

Guess what happened?

If you guessed that they were not sent over then you would be correct. It has been a full week and they have been asked 2 more times to deal with my request and get it done. As of today I had to call the new office and they said that they would call them directly themselves, for the second time, and have them sent over.

dr. Shehane, (when you start treating patients with the respect and care we deserve and acting like a doctor who cares, I'll use a capital ""D"") there are plenty of other physicians out there to choose from. I will tell as many of my friends, family and co-workers to stay far away from you and your practice as possible.

Anybody reading this should do the same thing when you receive sub-standard service from your doctor or anyone who provides a service for that matter.

Don't just stand idly by and perpetuate this kind of treatment. Be proactive and maybe we can change the way doctors do business."

 While the overall results of the procedure were disappointing, the worst part of the experience was the huge turnover in staff. Each visit I interacted with new staff members that were ""in training"".  The training of the technicians seemed to be lacking and I was burned and electrically shocked.

While on the green, a lady tracked him down and immediately started accusing him of stealing the cart and said that this cart has been sitting for 4 hours. Mind you, we had THIS same cart for the last four hours and how would we have the keys if we STOLE this cart???? This lady had blonde hair was supposedly part owner. I have never experienced such horrible customer service. We were trying to calmly explain that we were simply looking for our coat. There was no explaining anything to this woman.

yIJJ2DUHc4B0W_lkuQee_w,1JxVvMkDcFLQfupnsqWKKA,"Between Bellechasse and Beaubien is my favourite part of the Plaza. Over the years some really nice spots have opened in this block and DГ©pot 74 fills a need which is affordable, filling food done well.

From the outside the spot looks a little timid but the inside is warm, filled with industrial dГ©cor with vintage accents. Playing is a classic/oldies station which I think is fitting and enjoyable.

Depending on the time of day it can be quiet, but it fills up around lunch time. This makes sense considering you can get a pretty hefty meal for around $10.

The majority of the items on the menu are $5 with a few more elaborate items going for a few dollars more. There are a couple of beef burgers, sausage burgers, pizzas, pastas, poutine, sandwiches going for $5 and all the salads are $5. On most of the mains you can add a side of fries for $2 or a poutine for $3. 

Today they happened to be shooting photos for their website so I got to snap some photos of the food. For myself I ordered a bbq burger (with bacon and real melted cheese) - $5, plus a side of poutine - $3, and a dijon salad - $5. Grand total was $13 and I ate a hell of a lot. 

The costs might be low but the presentation is still nice, the buns and garnishes are not afterthoughts. If you're looking for a quick bite on the Plaza or around Beaubien metro, I think Depot 74 is worth a visit.

There are some veggie options and the owner tells me they will be opening for brunch soon."

*this review is purely based on the business management, not on the food (we left after over 30 mins of waiting)*

Very very very poorly organized for grand opening. There are only a few seats available and they had not even set up the tables for customer use. We were lucky enough to get a table but we were not told to line up to order the food. The promotion started at noon and people suddenly filled the place. People were not lining up and everyone was crowding around the counter. All the employees looked very confused and not prepared for opening. They don't even know how to use the machines!! Some employees at the back were discussing and arguing about what to do. They clearly don't know how to run a business. 

Some people ordered like six free noodles even though they only had two people, and the cashier allowed them to do so.

There's a storage/electric switch cabinet above the table at the back. While we were waiting for our food, they had to come open the doors to turn on some switches. They have done this four times. All the dust was flying out of the cabinet onto our table.

The group seated at the table that came in last managed to get their food first... we waited for 30 mins and still no food. There were at least three orders ahead of us. We asked for a refund and left. Their machines were already failing and they had to keep switching the electric switches. Their kitchen is very tiny, not meant to be a restaurant and it cannot support this amount of orders (keep in mind this used to be a ShareTea).

If you don't know how to run a business please spend more time practicing before opening up to the public. Clearly these people just opened up without any planning or business experience. Just because you know how to cook doesn't mean you can open up a restaurant. This location is not meant to be a restaurant given its size and design. 

0/5 - No matter how good the food is, if you cannot serve it in a timely manner, no one will be able to try the food."

5LPc3wonGJHZtK-HjASNAA,p8DJVgXPU_Y52wqSNtlJgA,"We have worked with Blue Brushes for two major jobs around our house - full exterior and interior painting.  We had some issues during the interior job (slight paint oversprays onto mouldings, paint on blinds, scratches on an expensive dining room table), but they were resolved after having to argue with the company that the scratch was actually caused by their crew.

The larger issues came later: we began experiencing surfactant leaching, accumulation of oily soap-like discharge on the walls, in both bathrooms of the house.  Steve came out, and insisted that the issue was that there was insufficient ventilation in the rooms, and that it was a soap residue that had been accumulating on the walls.  He then recommended that we install ventilation fans in the bathrooms (not inherently a bad idea), and repaint the bathrooms, which we were going to pay for at full price (Steve offered no discount, despite that we were returning customers, and this was a problem that he could have mitigated).  Over the period of a month, Steve became difficult to get ahold of, and we were unable to get ahold of subcontractors to get quotes for electrical and roofing surfaces, because we were asked to work with ""friends"" of his, and never given numbers for them.  Moreover, we were nevrer given exact prices for the installantion of the ventilation systems, only estimates.  When we decided to only get paint, and not the fans, as it was leaching, not soap residue (we had other professionals agree with us on this), Steve decided to pass on the job, and then ignored our calls to discuss options.

According to several paint sites, the leaching is caused by the paint not fully setting before humidity is allowed to accumulate on it, a potential issue that we had never been warned about.  Had the ventillation been such a major priority that not getting a fan is stopping him from taking the job, this is something we should have been informed of when he painted the entire house.  The response has been very unprofessional, and we will be looking for another painter to take care of fixing his mess."

We saw families coming with pillows to really get comfortable during the film.  My kid wasn't ready to sit through a whole movie, but he absolutely loved playing on the 'boat' in the nature center.  My toddlers could easily burn a couple hours here.

We came again this past weekend for a child's birthday party, and they really did a fantastic job.  One of the naturalists brought in a cart full of critters and told the kids all about them and even let them pet a few (toad, frog, salamander, turtle, snake, etc.).  

Some other awesome things at the Canalway Center:  step stools in the restrooms and at the water fountain for small people, coffee and rockers in an all-windows room - perfect for bird watching or reading the paper, smooth, wide trails for wagons and strollers, a movie theater room with a long list of films to choose, and a beaver lodge too!

They also didn't rush right into yanking the floor and baseboards out without a strategic game plan first. They safely boxed and packed our three bed house up and moved everything into Several Pods in the street and driveway. 

After the constructions repairs were over, weeks later they came back and unpacked us. I would definitely recommend them and will call them again if I'm ever in that situation again. 

Thanks again ServPro Henderson!  These guys are the best in Vegas in my opinion"

gAW6vG9Sin4kWmAkdi_Zcw,ayzlG6ZAWVGZUu-12XjsiA,"The worst experience ever. DO NOT MOVE HERE. The complex is managed extremely poor. And that is putting it nicely. The property manager is beyond rude and has no customer services skills, she is condasending and passive aggressive. I lived here for 2 and a half years and during this time I was never late on my rent but I did have many, many, many issues. My apartment has electrical problems that they NEVER looked into. Light bulbs would blow every week and in the master bedroom the light socket shorted causing my lamp to catch on fire! (thank God I was home!) The property manager told me I was using the wrong light bulbs. My apartment also flooded 3 times! Twice it came up through the kitchen sink and the third it came down from the ceiling in the guest bathroom. Guess what management did about this? You got it, NOTHING! I am 100% sure there is mold in the apartment and my carpets were ruined and I asked for a simple carpet cleaning and couldn't even get that. I resigned a 4 month lease, because I was moving out of state and didn't want to move somewhere for 4 months then have to pack up and move again. When I resigned the lease we were promised a carpet cleaning and when we went to ask when they could come the property manager denied it. Your lucky if the pools are open and when they are they are either extremely dirty or filled with so many chemicals you don't want to step foot in it. My refrigerator wouldn't even open! The worst of it all is my apartment was trashed because all of the issues I had there I figured I wouldn't get my 350 deposit back, but she got me again! I got a bill for over $1800! So if the horrible neighborhood doesn't scare you away from this place I hope this review does. I wouldn't wish these apartments and the property manager on my worst enemy!"
yVtcmvd_4KnePt7A0cv63g,APFbeq31A2gE5vlO2kdl9Q,"I researched a TON of doctors and chose Dr. Wooten and Beleza Plastic Surgery and I am SO glad I made that choice. From the first interaction with Andrea over the phone I knew I was coming to the right place. All of the staff that I have interacted with have been amazing. They really make you feel at ease and comfortable. You can contact any of them and know that you will be taken care of, no matter the need. 

There is no one I would trust more for any cosmetic procedure than Dr. Wooten. She is BEYOND wonderful. When you go in for a consultation she really sees you as a person and listens to what you have to say. You will never leave the office feeling like you were rushed or didn't have your questions answered. She is an amazing person and does amazing work. 

I cannot recommend Beleza enough. In fact I've been working on a much longer review that will be shared at a later time."

They do NOT have cart rentals available, which is shocking - considering at how slopy this course was. The slopes are also what makes this par 3 course difficult. Your short game will really mess you up, or maybe it's just me. 

I went in early October, and there were so many leaves on the green, putting was almost impossible. I brushed the leaves away from my putting line, and WHOOSH the wind will blow more over. (repeat for all 18 holes) 

There is a vendor selling drinks on a golf cart that comes around once in awhile, I think they should hire someone to maintain the greens instead. 

There were a few holes that we needed to tee off on this beaten up mat. I agree with everyone else - they need to have those replaced. 

I don't think it's worth it to pay $27.00 per person to play on a poorly maintained course. I'm guessing that's the price they can charge for being 'in the city' and right beside Victoria Park TTC Station. 

There are much better/well maintained golf courses outside the GTA that charge at a cheaper price. So, for those who own a vehicle, you're better off elsewhere!"
tRQd3xNI7FwkqgGcNIyGtg,WvRVTn9G5XFl5ckMj6dl9w,"Let me start by saying I go to Extreme Pita in Deerfoot Meadows all the time and I love it. With my positive experiences at the Deerfoot location I decided to try the one in Market Mall. What a mistake! First, the guy working was sitting on a chair near the register on his phone. I had to say hi three times before he looked up and reluctantly got up to help me. I ordered a buffalo chicken pita which is my favourite at the Deerfoot Meadows location and as soon as he started making it I should have run. He only put one small scoop of chicken on the grill for a regular sized pita and maybe a tablespoon of onion and a little cheese on top. No mushrooms, then in the bowl he dumped a tonne of lettuce and a tiny bit of tomato and the sauce. The chicken was barely cooked, in fact the cheese wasn't even melted and he was putting it in the bowl. Then the best part, he didn't mix it like I have always seen at he other location. He tossed it for a few seconds in a bag and then put the whole thing in the pita. I don't know why I paid after seeing , I guess it's just my politeness. What I ended up getting was a dry lettuce pita with a few token pieces of chicken and barely any sauce. It was bland and I threw most of it away. I will definitely be back to the Deerfoot location but never again at his one. What a waste"

Plus, they have a bunch of wine and wine-related accessories. A group of us wandered in here during the Taste of Tremont, and it was bustling with customers (and not just because it was delightfully air-conditoned). We got my wino sister-in-law this really unique-looking wine bottle chiller with two glass holders attached, and we didn't spend too much.

I recall there also being a comfy chair that I sat in for a few minutes. That was nice. Many times, these boutique shops give you the stink eye for sitting down on their furniture."

I have internet with them and it is very fast so i have no complaints. I recently (6 months ago ) got a box that allows me more channels. I did not really want this, however in a moment of weakness i was talked into it over the phone while i was trying to down grade me service. Anyway they sent me the box along with a remote.  It just looked far too complicated for my busy life so i just put it aside and never touched it again for 6moths. I am being serious.                               So one day i decided i really should hook it up since i am paying for it.           I tried and again complication set in.       Then i read the directions and  called the  number provided for help. They are very helpful over the phone. They said they were open 24 hours a day for tech support.   The thing i don't like is that it is an outsourced company that comes to do the work.  At least it is not India and they live and work here. But, i just do not understand why everyone has to outsource.      The company i work for also outsources so what can you do.??? The 4 stars are for that reason. Other than that the customer service is very good.

I ended up in the second bay, where one of the windows between the second and third bay was missing, so I ended up getting sprayed in the face by the guy in the third bay. Also, the parts where the hose connects above the car seemed to be leaking, so while I intended to only wash my mats, soap dripped on the roof of my car and I ended up having to wash my entire car. When I put money in the machine, it started showing something incomprehensible on the timer, where only the first of the 4 digits kept changing, so it was impossible to tell how much time was left. I kept adding money when the time started flashing, but at one point it started flashing and when I added another looney, it lasted another 5-10 seconds and then it shut off.

There's just nothing redeeming about this wrap whatsoever.

Take your same $7.00 over to My Big Fat Greek Gyro closeby in Market Square, and get a serious lunch.  I was trying to be healthy, but it's pretty hard if we're going to call this a meal.

I dropped off the car that morning and was told to return at the end of the day.  I picked up my car, paid the man and went home.  It was dark so the car looked fine to me.  But it rained that week and when the sun came out I noticed all these scratches on the hood of my car!  The whole hood...like he used sandpaper to polish it!  The following weekend when I went back to complain to the guy who did the detailing he said he didn't remember me or my car and accused me of lying!  My husband was with me and he got into a shouting match with him. Then we asked to speak with the manager and the manager started yelling at us and also called us liars!  Unreal!!  I was in shock!

I've been going to Dr Chan for a year now and have never been treated nicely by the women at the front desk. Not only are they rude and ignorant when you call for any appointments or try to ask them a question but they are down right nasty when you go in for appointments too. I am taking my family of 7 else where. I spoke to Dr Chan about this before and he kind of shrugged it off, well I will be lodging a formal complaint as well. Charging people $50 for missed appointments, when appointments were never given is absurd. Especially when you meet with the doctor for 5 minutes and hes pushing you out the door to get to the next.

They are located right next to another vapor shop called Euphoria Vapor. What I always tell people: ALWAYS come here before going next door to Euphoria because this place is almost always less expensive and the people are less stuck up. Example: An IPV box mod at Cheap Tobacco was about 25% less expensive than what Euphoria was selling it for. Replacement atomizers for my tank were four bucks; they'll cost you five bucks at Euphoria. These costs add up.

Don't get me wrong, Euphoria is a good shop, too, and I've spent over $500 there in the last month alone replenishing/upgrading my stuff. Just always check Cheap Tobacco first... You might save yourself A LOT of money."

The hotel provides a variety of amenities. You can find a pool, gym, banquet area, and variety of conference rooms just to name a few. During my stay, someone had a dog with them in their hotel room so I think the place is pet-friendly but I'd double check if you do need that option since I don't know the circumstances of that situation.  

I can't remember anything special that stood out about Edward Hotel. Since we were constantly on the go during the tour, we pretty much just stopped at hotels for the night and left first thing in the morning after breakfast. Not a bad option if you're looking to stay around a quieter area!"
JOCYjQMna9vlprOj1-9L2Q,P5oxDq4BKLsHOjFiAYuLgQ,I am very pleased with the job Anthony did on my old galvanized pipes.  He was efficient and very pleasant.  I like the fact that it's a small company.  I hear that the staff are very happy there.
kRQWUBGIEeJEDFpGlWDawg,HPU--xMKVhRa5pxSz9VWAw,This is the worst place. Bought a stack able from them and like the rest of the reviews the delivery guy was late and was not careful. Woman said we had 48hrs to check it out and low and behold it did not work properly. The cold water did not work. They would not come fix it I had to take it back to them to fix. Or they could come and pick it up for $35. Then another delivery charge to bring it back $35. I should have read the receipt but needed something fast and cheap... you get what you pay for!

HBC1Vcv8U-HHPjHeEIynTw,X56sbM-pGyuxRlZmku9vDw,"WORST - DO NOT MOVE IN 

PROS: 
Location - sleepy/boring Summerlin. Close to Red Rock Casino, Downtown Summerlin, Wholefoods, Raising Caine's Chicken, In & out Burgers, and easy access to the 215.

CONS: 
Management - Wants you in - that's it! Once you are a resident you are on your own. 
Security - Joke; multiple units broken into recently (Jan-Jun 2018).  
Maintenance - Delayed maintenance work orders - smoke alarms: you better have your own battery and know how to replace it; they'll show up 2 days after - Maintenance personnel is absolutely polite and dedicated to their job; but overshadowed by management.
Old appliances - My 2nd dryer replacement was used as well, and now shrinks everything on any setting. 
Jacuzzi and pool - Out of service for months at a time, announced with printed out signage. 
Gym - Door to the gym doesn't work (March - Jun 2018); to top it off there's a resident that thinks it's ok to train his outside clients at the property's gym. Annoying: he's always there, residents can't come in since outsiders come in and out at all times of the day due to this trainer/resident. Talked to Management about it, they're cool with it!  
- I'M BREAKING THE LEASE

The pub is part of the historical Caledon inn and there are different options for seating.  There is a main dining room, fine dining area upstairs, and a nice patio as well.
The inn is also a venue for weddings and functions and the James McCarty pub is priced accordingly (a bit high).  The menu is not huge, but most people will find something that they like.

The fish and chips ($15) is a great choice!
The portion was huge and the fish was fresh.
You can upgrade to sweet potato fries for (+$3).

We ordered the chicken fingers ($14)...the portion was not so large.
5 chicken strips which were moist and crispy.
And we never got our sweet potato fries... but the regular fries were still good.
It just wasn't a lot of food for $14.

And, my draft beer was $6.50.

Overall, I like this pub.  
The service is friendly and the atmosphere is welcoming. 
However, I find the prices a bit steep."

This ""company"" has zero integrity. Trevor Barrett is a thief and a liar. I was in the process of purchasing a home with Trevor. He took all our personal info and sent us a pre-qualification letter. We found a home and put in an offer, following his guidelines. We thought all was good.

We were wrong. This guy disappeared. Then the whole company shut down.  The buyers (me), the sellers, our agent, their agent, the title company and the inspection company were all on hold. We talked to the receptionist at Barrett, who could not be ruder, and she would give us no answer on Trevor's whereabouts and would under no circumstances allow us to talk to another lender. Next, all the voice mails were full, Trevor's and the front line. This went on for days until we lost the house. 

I asked Trevor to pay us back for the wire transfer costs to the title company of $35.00. He refused and still refuses to this day. If you want to get screwed around with, go to Trevor. He might respect somebody with lots of money but he definitely believes he is better and above the average human. He's a sicko. I am disabled and he knows it from all the paperwork. Taking advantage of the disabled is despicable. Not communicating with your clients is just his way of letting you know, you don't matter to him."
3gn1tgwQ8PTdjXt0oBAV5w,G5BqF32PyIQ5IvplDvpKnA,"Another office supplies store... What to say because frankly, they are all the same. I hate to say that but they pretty much are. Similar layout, similar products, similar prices. As a matter of fact some products are identical to the others but with different branding but I think the same Chinese factory makes the same product for all the companies. I digress... This particular location is seated well between West Towne Wall but closer the West Gate Mall. They have the standard thingamabobs and doodads for all your office needs at, in my opinion, probably the cheapest in the city. They actually have a little bigger selection than their competitors but I think that is based on sheer age of the company. Office Depot has been around since I can remember and was ALWAYS the first stop for school supplies.

So, the company has been around forever and they have the cheapest prices in town you say? So Colin, why only 3 stars then?! WELL ILL TELL YA... (dramatic effect) I give a three star rating for essentially one reason. Lack Of Change. This Office Depot hasn't changed since I was a wee-little-lad back in first grade. I just don't understand how a company expects to move forward if they are not willing to Market themselves. I have not seen any advertisements or bilboards for Office Depot in a very long time and can't imagine they're doing very well. I know that it might seem that that would reflect more on the company as a whole than a particular store but why isn't that store pushing harder to market themselves?

As most of my friends and readers on Yelp will realize about me that I enjoy the future very much and where we are going. Not particularly where we have been. In some situation its good to remain where you are and that's the spirit and charm of some places. Not however, for a company that sells technology products and business related items.

The store itself? Clean, organized, staff is excellent, but a little crowded entry way."
XUIku9MyNgh3bmRqypSuMw,leJEG7VNrgaU1Ck0zAO-DQ,"I ordered their chicken roti for takeout, but after a couple minutes the lady at the counter apologized and said the chicken wasn't available did I want something else. I ended up getting the jerk chicken dinner instead and she didn't charge me extra even though it was more expensive.

I'm really glad I ended up with the jerk chicken. It is absolutely delicious! The seasoning on the chicken is so flavourful. There's a mellow heat so it won't be a problem for any spice wimps. The dinner was served with rice and carrot and cabbage slaw. Both side dishes were so good. The slaw had a pleasing sweetness to it. And the rice was seasoned well, fluffy, and studded with beans. They also give you an incredibly huge amount of food. This is easily enough for two or three meals. 

This is probably more of a takeout place than a sit-down restaurant. They do have a few tables, but it's not a traditional sit-down setup. 

I am definitely coming back here again!"

Well, this was the best a barber has ever done on his hair, so I suppose that means they did a good job. But I do better, and I have absolutely no training in cutting hair. I guess I'm an expert on my husband's hair?!?"

Sat down with a surprisingly large crowd watching the Cubs open a can of whoop ass on the Cardinals to win the NLDS. Brittany was our bartender and she was fantastic. Attentive, quick to pour a drink, and got our food out of the kitchen in about 10 minutes. 

My buddy ordered wings. Asked what flavor a they had?  Said anything you want so he got hot buffalo ranch. They were outstanding!  If that's all we got, this would be a 5 star review. 

But no, I had to order the bacon cheeseburger. Had an option to upgrade fries to onion rings at no extra cost.  I took it and the rings were as good as the wings. The burger, on the other hand, was kinda blah. Apparently frozen, then fried, topped with a couple of slices of bacon and a slice of cheese that looked like a small blanket covering a giant in a doll house, it was just so so. The bun was cold (could have been buttered and toasted on the grill for a much better sandwich.) 

So at the end of the day: great service, cold beer, nice people and fair to excellent food. Don't miss this place if your in the neighborhood!"

They were consider very good communicators until recently.   (June 22, 2016) I needed a Headlight replaced and I prepaid to have Firestone order the part from Day Ford as I didn't trust Ford with this repair because of a very bad situation with them.  I have been using Firestone for the past 3 years  Specifically 500 Chauvet Drive Pgh, PA 15275.  Firestone Monroeville Mall called me when the part came in and I stopped in after work to see when the light could be installed.  Once I arrived another customer (Lady came in the same time as me so I allowed the lady to be seen first).  While waiting for my turn to be waited on; another man [ who was white] (I am black) came in:  the Service Mgr. stopped almost immediately and waited on him and left me standing there as if I wasn't even in the Services Center!  After the While man left The Service Mgr. continued on with the lady that he was talking with.   This situation made very upset because you'd think I'd be treated better than that.  I have spend Thousands of dollars at Firestone during the past 3 years keeping my Ford Edge AWD Limited in great condition....  Keep in mind I worked a 12 hour shift and I was very tired that day, so I simply walked out and sent an online complaint to Firestone headquarters.  I am still waiting for my headlight to be installed.   I really like Firestone and hope  that this was simply a misunderstanding and if so, I will come back and update this review...

Their prices are the usual high end of the scale but they are standard for a B&M.
What gives this place 4 stars is it's fantastic wall shelved with jars of many different pipe tobacco's, there mainly blends but they also have a good selection of brand name tins of pipe tobacco aswell.
As usual it's just the price's that stops this place getting 5*

So last year I went in search of a local tax preparer, preferably a financial professional with reasonable rates, and preferably not a franchise operation like H&R or a larger accounting firm that would charge a much higher rate. I found Muller Financial Services, made an appointment, and had my taxes done in under an hour for almost half of what I was paying to bang my head against the computer trying to do them myself. Not only that, but James also showed me I had been doing my taxes totally wrong and saved me money on my return. I used him again this year and spent a grand total of one hour having to deal with taxes. Now I'm done and filed and I'll probably have my refund in hand by March.

David was great because he did NOT feel like a dishonest salesman only looking to make a sale. He was very honest and accurate about pricing, issues with homes, repair cost, timelines, etc. He closely listened to exactly what I was looking for which I did not expect to find anything within my parameters, but he found many homes I liked.


 Surprisingly, I found the house I wanted the next day and he put the offer in the following day. He also got me set up with a loan officer very quickly named Spencer Dunsmoor. Spencer got me pre-qualified in no time and he was very  helpful making sure I understood everything. Although Spencer was great the company he works for called Southern Fidelity Mortgage was not so good, but I believe Spencer left and started his own business.


Although David was my original Realtor, I also worked with Eric and and Brad. All 3 were very helpful, friendly, and honest, but most importantly, I was impressed at how quickly they would answer emails, texts, calls, and voicemails. 


Eric was a powerful ally against the mortgage company and the seller (HUD). I often told him to ""work your magic"" and he always delivered. I don't think anyone else would have gotten me the house because HUD and the mortgage company made is so hard."

Sherlock's is a regular haunt for me when I visit whitby, (especially after I received really rude service once in Marie Antoinette's) victorian ephemera, getting all a little ""tea shop of curiosities"" themed with the mystery man himself, drawing in goths and happy families alike. 
It's cute, with tables and little cubbies, my favourite at the end of the corridor-like room downstairs, that feels a little like you're sat in a train compartment, with your traditional cakes, scones, fruit meringues and Dracula themed treats- it is whitby, after all.

The coffee smells excellent, and although I don;t drink it, everyone who I've sat and ate with has enjoyed it. I tend to stick to tea, but their hot chocolate is pretty fantastic, and they do have a good range of hot and cold drinks, and of course hot and cold food too, which I've heard is wonderful, but I've normally eaten fish and chips, or pie already by this point.

I must also note, that they're the only place I've been to serve a lemon meringue pie that comes close to the standard of my Nanna's, and she's the best."

It's a $1,500 hit...up front...plus the cost of food and assorted vitamins that they insist you buy. $400-$500 per month. Their commercials never mention the cost so consider yourself warned. Will not argue that the program works, but once you leave and try to ""rejoin,"" you're suddenly a brand new customer and must pony up another $1,500 new member fee."

The cole slaw used to be a favorite and suddenly they started adding way too much pepper.  The Texas sheet cake is also very good.

YN58Coh1nvnsNS0FXIeAKg,FzojxZ0mmCuiJs4fecpimQ,"Awful experience! Beware! We worked with Erin for approximately 8 months before firing her. Over the course of working with her, we were consistently disappointed. Erin is very passive and really tries to push the work onto the client. She also isn't detail oriented! There were several mistakes each time she sent a vendor or contract to us - they had the wrong times, dates, and venues. Each time I spoke with Erin on the phone I had to repeat something I had said earlier. She did not prepare for our meetings and always had to be reminded of previous decisions or discussions. 

The topping on the cake was when after communicating with her for over 8 months, she casually informed us that she would not actually be in attendance at our wedding. She would have 'an assistant' there. Erin never informed us that she wouldn't be there and we never had the opportunity to meet this 'assistant'. We were completely blindsided and shocked that this is how she does business. For the sake of your sanity, use another wedding coordinator - Erin is not a professional."

So yes on the two lips don't ever buy your family poinsettias from there!!! They died in less than two weeks and I basically threw them away because I didn't want my other plants to get sick from that and I know poinsettias could last a long time because I've got poinsettias that I got three years ago that are still alive.

You cannot go on with your life stealing lying being greedy committing adultery being angry pride etc. As the church fathers say by the grace of God we need to purify our souls of the passions which is a lifetime struggle. The church says to be Christ like. We quote the gospel a lot and the head of our church is Jesus Christ. Repentance and confession are mysteries of orthodoxy. At 1st I was why do they stand all the time. Why do they do the cross. What are the icons. Who are the saints. What does theotokos mean. Why are they saying lord Jesus Christ have mercy on me. Now I know why Jesus Christ was crucified and resurrected for the salvation of our souls!  Luke 23:34 that is how much the lord loves us. glory to God he came into my life!

It is so not worth 17000 if you absolutely need to find a good program. Go to Kaplan or northwestern this school is price higher for no reason theirs no support or motivation to help students. If they like they will not give you a hard time but if you questions abilities and put pieces together its quit sad. Once again the idea is not to see you thrive but fail. Yes you might work some place temporary but through my constant ability to adapt I found a job not with the skills I was given through this school. Only through my ability to ask questions and my work hiatory. Praise god I got through but now I'm going to another school to do the same thing I paid 17,000 to do not by choice but because I actually want they ability to become and do something with my life so of you want to be treated like a inmate prisoner not the place to go to to better yourself"

This place smells like incense, and the menu is a tiny white board hidden in the corner and barely legible. To be straight, this is more of a bar for locals than a dine in spot so I highly recommend calling in your order and picking it up. I would describe the roti here as similar to a chicken curry burrito. I ordered the boneless chicken roti spicy and loved every messy bite of it. My boyfriend order the same and his was a bit on the saltier side. Overall I enjoyed my roti and if I'm ever back around that part of town I might order out again."

$356.00 to hang a small chandelier over my front door and to put a fan over my dining room table.   What a disgrace.    Took over 2 1/2 hours today to finish up a job he started 2 weeks ago.   Two weeks prior was another 2 hours.... again the same constantly on the phone.   If Tom spent more time working than answering text messages and talking on the phone.. he would have had the job done in 1/2 the time.   I never seen a electrician walk in and out of someone's home to make phone calls and answer texts.   Even on the ladder he was playing with his phone.   Minimum 50 texts and calls during the 2.5 hours.   What a episode.   No supplies on his pick up truck.    I had to go back to the store to pick up a small amount of chain.   Also likes to rip people off....telling them one price and coming up with another at the end of the job....saying he had to install a whole new fan.... if he would have listen to me and just remove the base (motor).... and leave the rod and ceiling part alone,  he would have gotten done sooner... but no, he wanted to jack the price up telling me he can't splice the wires together like that.... He needed to remove the whole thing... that was before I caught him in a lie when he found out I was a mechanic.     It was ok he spliced my chandelier wiring to extend it,  but not the fan wire.

GageIAoziHorlYijf8kz8A,5yHcwY0NW0aj_gs3rqmFcQ,"Dr. Graves is a miracle worker. I was able to walk the same day of the outpatient surgery although another surgeon had told me I'd be on crutches for 8 weeks with his approach. I had severe club toes on my left foot for many years that had progressively gotten worse and worse until I had constant pain when walking, especially downhill. Hiking, my favorite pastime, was a thing of the past. The only pair of shoes I could wear was a size 14 light-weight breathable pair of running shoes, fitted with special orthotics,  that I had to keep stretching further every few days to make them tolerable. A decade ago, at 66, I'd had a bad experience with toe surgery on my right foot, which took four months before I could walk without crutches or drive a car. Now, at 76 years old, I feared the healing time would be even longer and more disruptive of my life, and my wife and I had recently started a business which required a lot of walking on hard surfaces. However, the pain finally got so bad I had to act.  I found Dr. Stanley Graves, referred by an excellent foot surgeon I knew at the Steadman Orthopedic Clinic in Vail, Colorado. Dr. Graves was very personable and explained clearly how he would take out three knuckles to shorten the toes, and then straighten the last sections. He not only showed me on an X-ray, but drew me a picture of how he would do it. I was amazed when he told me that I could walk the same day of surgery if wanted to, though he suggested using support for a few days while the swelling and pain subsided. I was thunderstruck, but sure enough, on the drive home from the surgery I walked in and out of a Costco with my wife and then drove around in a cart with my foot up on the basket to help keep the swelling down, walked unsupported into our house. The pain was surprisingly mild, and I only needed two pain pills after surgery. Still, I used crutches at home for 3 days for partial support to minimize the pain and swelling. I wore a special, quite comfortable, sandal-like shoe. After 3 days I put aside the crutches for good and walked freely everywhere on the sandals. I used a strong anti-inflammatory for a month or so to keep the swelling down and virtually eliminate any pain. His work has given me my life back after many years of limitations- amazing! I can't recommend Dr. Graves highly enough!"

I initially called the 800 number to set the appointment. They refused to give me any information about what they do. I asked if this is a surgery center, they refused to answer. I told them I wanted my double chin reduced or removed and ""do you do surgery?"".  They said I would have to come in for a consultation. Then they transferred me to the local office since it was same day.  They gave me the same run-around, but I thought, maybe that's how these things work. 

I arrived, and they asked me to fill out 3 pages of information prior to my consultation. I said, ""first, can you tell me if this is a surgery center?"" and they wouldn't answer. So I asked ""Is this some kind of miracle cream pitch?"" and they finally said ""No"", ""we do surgery"". I said I'd rather not have to fill out all the info as I was going to go to three separate consultations before making my decision on where to have my surgery, but she insisted. Ok, but really, 3 pages of my info before even talking to me?  Ok, maybe that's how these things work.

I filled it out, and while doing so, the office lady said ""Let me turn up the volume on the TV as this is the initial part of your consultation"".  Seriously?  It's nothing but testimonials and I already got that on your website.  What a disappointment this was turning into.  

Then, despite having arrived 10 minutes early, the lady tells me that since I arrived so late, my appointment wouldn't take place for at least 40 minutes (or 2:10pm).  What?!?!  Is that how you do business?  Why not just tell me your first appointment is at 2:10?   I spent an hour of my day and a gallon of my gas to try and pay you thousands of dollars for elective surgery and this is how you treat your customers?!?  

So I asked the lady if I could have my information back as I was leaving, and she said ""Well, since your hopping from doctor to doctor we should keep it"".  What?!?!  

If I were an investor in this company, I would cringe at the money walking out the door for lack of patient customer service."

K9Ycc5lO5CCqH2KMZInZag,Jb13QyXGi0zD4ZtSTBQwpQ,"Treasure Hunt is impressive, alright. Impressively bad.

It's been a long time since I felt actively angry at how much a store was being squandered. I actually had a review written up for this months ago, but ended up deleting it because it came off like the rantings of an unhinged lunatic. After another (mercifully-short) visit recently, I'm confident that my feelings weren't misplaced.

When I heard that the Sears Outlet Store that formerly occupied this location was closing months ago, I was glad. That store had become trashy and dumpy, filled with all kinds of knockoff brands and haphazard selection. I thought a new discount store was going to allay those problems, if not eliminate them completely. After all, Dixie is already filled with designer stores that pride themselves on selling end-of-season products, so why shouldn't this be any different? The website also seemed very interesting, and it sounded like this chain would be a far different beast that sourced high-quality brands.

How wrong I was.

This is functionally the same Sears outlet without the branding, with the added negatives of somehow having worse selection and only operating three days out of the week. I'm mystified as to how they're still running. Who's visiting this place? Both times I went, the store was practically empty (both in terms of patrons and merchandise), filled with all kinds of knockoff brands I'd never heard of, cheap-quality clothing and a lot of empty space on the floor. Not to mention merchandise that still feels way too expensive even with the discounts.

The only value I can find to this place is if you wanted to buy a cheap mattress or party supplies. The men's clothing I browsed felt incredibly cheap and still priced way too high for their quality, several of the sections looked like they'd been hit by a hurricane, and the whole atmosphere was incredibly off-putting.

There are much better options in Mississauga if you're looking for cheap goods or clothing. Avoid like the plague."

All negative comments about living in this property are true.
When you face a problem, you will also face numerous ""protocols"" against you. When you look through the endless lease terms they make you sign, you will notice that it's mostly designed to protect the property, and transfer responsibility to tenants. When the management does something wrong, there will be very little to nothing you can do against them (e.g. 21 days to issue deposit; what if they don't? Can you charge them fees like they always do?). It's essentially close to a slavery agreement (is there such thing? if you are curious, take time to read through the lease and reflect), not a place to live. Previous management used to be nice, but that's a history long gone. It is now a potential jail, which you may choose to withhold yourself.

If you are fascinated by the below list, it's a perfect place for you. 

-Black mold (chronic).
-Rats and raccoons in home and storage.
-Random charges.
-Being blamed (bird-feeding noise was theatrical; read other reviews). 
-Leeks (storage, furnace) and damages to your property due to it.   
-Illegal behaviors done without shame (sudden notice and charges, not returning deposit), blackmailing. 
-Pretentious, irresponsible and forceful management, but with a good smile.
-Rent raising every year. Management will ""re-adjust"" if you complain as if they are doing you a favor. 

The key is, there is no chance of resolution. Is this the type of living space you seek? If so, below may be the reasons.

-Good neighbors
-Good location"
8Gee3ZEsuPcAf24V40c5gw,5ClP4O44_kVWBC7deuE3jw,"This is my local library branch, so I felt the need to give it some love on Yelp. The place is everything a good library should be. Friendly librarians. Well stocked. Fast service when picking up books/movies. Decent community computers to use. Plenty of spaces to plug in a laptop and free wifi. They even have a scanner which was super helpful to me when I needed to send some documents and no longer had access to one at my job. Printing is 5cents a page and is pretty much on the honor system. 

The walls are decorated with kids artwork from the local schools. There is a meeting room in the back that groups can use for get togethers. 

My only critique is that because it's so busy, the parking lot can get pretty full. Not really an issue in the summer when people are walking/biking here, but in the winter when more cars are being used and giant snow drifts are taking up spaces, it can be tight."

The customer service is atrocious I don't know if it's some people sitting it a shack drinking figuring out how to screw you or what but they are arrogant. They stick to oh no that could never happen you are wrong our software doesn't make mistakes although I've pointed out that I've been through this with them already and I got my money back because INDEED it did make a mistake.

I brought in my brand new RV for a wash on 10/15/17 and told the manager who greeted me and the worker to please be careful to not pressure wash my refrigerator vent. They both told me they all know this. Low and behold when I'm paying I see out the window some third guy who comes up and directly blasts my refrigerator vent 17 times. I said something to the cashier Bernice, who was completely clueless and worthless and just sat there so then I went out to the manager (who had greeted me by saying he was my guy if I need anything) and he went and told the worker (who looks like a meth head) that he's not supposed to do that. His response? he LAUGHED out loud. He thought it was hilarious that he just directly blasted the back of my fridge on my $80K RV. And the manager did nothing. Except to tell me I guess he didn't know. That's it. And I'm expected to pay full price for that. Including the tire dressing which THEY DIDN'T EVEN DO."

It ended up being $25 and $10 to fix my boots and my heels, respectively. He had it finished within a few hours, which worked out well because I just swung by after my errands - it was easy! The shoes look great. It's like having two new pairs! I wish I had taken before and after pictures so that you can see the difference. Perhaps, next time!

Uwzt1ruhSYIqko7XIDmD6g,ItlvdwKRkiEwJymSPg93lw,"I was introduced to this long-established family-run business by a friend who's bought some 8 cars from them over the course of many years.  What a RELIEF to deal with these no-pressure folks who have a casual, helpful approach to working with you. 

I considered several vehicles, and checking values from consumer information, 9th Ave's prices were at or below fair market estimates on all of them. The car I settled on was immaculate with low mileage (""Kilometre-age""?) at a very fair price. The deal itself was straight forward, with none of the haggling, none of the ""stealership"" sales tactics (e.g., ""Write your offer on this slip of paper, and wait here 20 minutes while I advocate for you with my sales manager..."")

As to my trade-in? They advised me not to! Told me my old car would be an easy private sale in this market (Suby WRX), and I could probably get $4k more for it with little time or trouble. 

I'll be going back to 9th Ave for future cars, have recommended them to friends already, and I recommend you consider them when buying a used vehicle."

SqxYhx0znOqCfaVIc7c-FA,qmjoMFMZdLH69_6eGTGDZw,"Went here on Sunday and ordered the special which was baked chicken, choice of potato and soup or salad.  I choose the salad and a baked potato.  First of all the salad is merely bag lettuce put in a bowl. Nothing more.  And it was room temperature. Yuck!  But the ranch dressing was good. 

 I loved the sweet tea!!

My Mom ordered the baked chicken too and when our plates arrived my Mom's was all dark meat while mine was all white meat.  How they choose that I do not know but my Mom was displeased with her chicken a lot.  The corn was down right awful.  It had some funky flavor that I could not figure out.  Obviously it had the canned taste but there was something else there.........

My chicken was good.  It came with a light gravy over it which made it all that better.  The baked potato....well how can you mess up a baked potato?  I'll tell you how. Only offer Country Crock margarine in those little tubs.  Do they know what that is made of???  Ugh!  It can kill you!! That stuff is gross.

I had to ask for extra napkins.  Another warning: Their napkins are thin and feeble and they only give you one. It disintegrates on contact.  

A few improvements would be: Stronger napkins. COLD lettuce for salad and try adding some cheese and tomatoes to spice it up a bit.  Ask if the customer prefers white or dark meat.  Get some real butter.  And get a different vendor for your corn because it is really bad.  Did it come over on a boat from China??

Both of her computers would not recognize my hard drive with my file, so she told me to use their internet terminal.  She didn't walk me over to the terminal or explain how it worked and she didn't offer to let me use it for free, despite the problem being on their end.

It took me five minutes to access and email my resume to the store because the browsers were out of date and the Internet was slow to load.

When I finally had my resumes in hand, the other worker was going to ring me up.  He informed me the total would be $0.54 (two sheets at $0.27 each).  I said, ""Well since I just paid $1.87 for your internet because your computers would not read my drive, let's call it even.""  He looked at me and then, sarcastically, agreed.

They rebuilt our flood damaged home and performed many remodeling upgrades at the same time. They offered sensible solutions and worked around our busy schedules. Calls were returned promptly and questions answered always. 
All of their subcontractors were people they had worked with for many years and were clean-cut, articulate craftsmen. They cleaned up after every days work and kept us up to date on progress. When we made changes along the way, they took it in stride and offered options to best achieve our goals. 
Our home was built in 1959 and had unique lath and plaster drywall. The materials are no longer available, but in order to retain the original quality of the home, they found a method that was similar enough to look the same and have the same sound when I did the ""knock test"". 
They did many extras, like painting the front sidewalk-""it just didn't look right all chipped up"" and made a new side gate as well- at no added charge- because it was the right thing to do. They understood what we were trying to do- bring the house back to original quality and remodel it for sale. 
To give you an idea of what kind of guys thy are, on the weekends, they volunteer at Habitat for Humanity and use their skills to built homes for the disadvantaged in the Valley. Good souls.
Jeff navigated us through a maze of options to get our electric upgraded without kicking us into a higher permit level that would have resulted in us having to lower windows for egress- at an estimated $26k. Instead, they offered legal, ethical alternatives that got the goals achieved within our budget. They know the ins and outs of the business and use it to YOUR advantage. True professionals.

It was $6.95, and the portion was a bit smaller than those in the full-service restaurant, but I'm happy to pay a bit extra for the convenience of being able to grab some Thai food while I'm on the go.  They also sell a lot of drinks and some imported snacks like Pocky.  

I'm not sure of their hours, but check them out if you're at the Waterfront around lunchtime.  They provide a nice halfway point between the convenience of fast food and the quality of a sit-down restaurant."
atmCY-gS-dM4zw3yfW1tvA,keuL1k2WVrR4oNKZbO0Hzw,"Meadows is a very welcoming foursquare church in Las Vegas.  My husband found Meadows on yelp and it's the only church we've been to since we moved here.  It's come as you are with Sunday School (CE) for all ages.  They just started J12 for tweens that my son enjoys.

They say it's a ""safe place to hear a dangerous message"" and I couldn't agree more.  Services begin and end with worship with the message the message in the middle given by Pastor Ron (father) or Pastor Ronnie (son).  I appreciate the no-nonsense, faith-based approach to hearing the Word.

Meadows has a lot to offer from its several ministries.  I personally serve in the Meals Ministry and in the Nursery.  I have also enjoyed the Women's Bible Study, which is part of the Women's Ministry.

If you're looking for family, community, and love, Meadows would be a good home church for you!"

First off, we were greeted with a smile. Then asked if we were in to purchase or for an exam.  They directed us to the exam area. 

The gal at the exam desk was just as friendly.  Since I called ahead she put us to the front of the line and took us to be seen almost immediately.   She was courteous and professional the entire time. 

Then the Dr. Walks in.  Very calm, friendly, and welcoming.  Completed our exam with care and knowledge. 

I want to make it a point to tell you that Dr. Kent Helmick was extremely patient with my son.  You don't always see medical professionals take the time to give that special attention to kids; unless they are pediatricians.  He was just great.

Lastly, we were pointed to the sales associate who told us in detail what our insurance was paying for and what our out of pocket expenses would be.   She too was patient and knowledgeable.  

Great office as a whole!"

YieMmug-g6Mv4EvLMFV-rA,HmYj8wXXzzmc80DIenufuw,"It was okay.

I took a quiche and a croissant (my staples to try in a bakery) and I found the quiche all right, but a bit soggy and a bit dry. Maybe it was a bit stale too, but who can blame them, it was a weekday when I went in.

The croissant was also overbaked, and a little too bready for me. It wasn't close to the ones I've had in Paris. I found the top of it a little too hard and dry, I feel like they might have brushed something like a glaze on top, and the flavour of it was veering on the side of sweet, which is very unusual in a plain croissant.

If I wanted a sugary croissant, I'd buy one. I buy plain butter croissants and I don't expect them to be sweet, which this one was...

I'll go back and give it another chance, maybe on a Friday, but as it stands, it still can't beat Le Gourmet Belge in Complexe Desjardins."

We called them to have a bmw towed in last week and when it got to the shop the lower part of the bumper was broken. We didnt really think anything of it because we have never had an issue with them. The customer was very upset when they came to pick up the vehicle and it was obviously not broken before the tow truck got. We found scratches on the under side where it had been dragged during the loading process. We then arranged for the customers car to be repaired. No biggie i just needed to call customer one and get it taken care of. Everyone has accidents right? NO! Not them! All i got was every excuse as to how there was no possible way they could ever do that not even on their worst day. I was surprised they even admit to ever towing it! We called to get a  new bumper and the first thing the parts guy said was ""what happened a tow truck rip it off?"". They have been a great company for many years but watch out when something goes wrong! Guess i get to foot the $800 bill for repairs in the name of customer service!!!"

8oOUIbIrscMlf4UOTRn20Q,eSXs2YBBw9yNMq1C_lcV0Q,"The OMC sign out front boasts a pretty bold claim of best burgers in town.  Now, as a person that crafts his own burgers (to perfection I might add) I like to think that I have a pretty decent handle on what it takes to build a proper burger.

Unfortunately my first impression of the burger menu wasn't great.  For 'The best burgers in town' their burger menu is really lacking.  Now, having said that the online menu actually has about 8 beef and 8 chicken burgers, not bad.  When I was there however I only found 2 beef burgers.  Not sure if this is an update to the menu or if it was a different lunch menu, but it seems they've added a few options now.

I ordered the banquet burger with spicy fries.  The burger itself was a little dry.  Certainly nothing about it would make me think it was the best in town (and certainly didn't compare to my own)  But, all in all and for the price, it wasn't too bad.  The actual cafe itself had kind of a cool atmosphere and prices were really reasonable, so I may give it another chance some time

Edit:  Well now I""m really confused the website actually shows a different address, and that explains the different menu.  Have they moved?"

1SLcUxH9wQr5VN_UCn6Blw,Iu5mS8o02-RGpjJdxI0v7w,"My very first time trying Afghan food today. This place has their original location on L'Acadie and which I've read good reviews about but as usual, laziness sometimes gets the best part of me in life so hello postponement. 

Fortunately, they just recently opened up their doors here in Laval and right on my daily commute path. I gotta say they did a good job attracting people from the outside of the restaurant with their chic decor and enough lighting to grab your attention. Specially with that big ""Halal"" neon sign in your face. I dunno, mixing religion with anything else is really not my thing plus stating the obvious like a peacock? I personally don't like that no matter what religion it is. Each to his own, keep your faith in your heart and to yourself please. Does the general public need these things shown off, flaunted and make the rest of us the none halal people feel alienated or welcomed in your establishment? Specially on businesses which their sole purpose is making money! My reaction: shaking my head..... then sticking with the main subject: Whatever, take my money. Where's the food? 

Back to the main topic. One word: Very good! I was hesitant between the Herath kebab and Mantou. Went with the first one only to test the quality/taste of the beef and chicken since both come on the same plate. Very nice choice. Good marinade, good taste and cotton soft meat all with a reasonable price and ample portion. 

I am definitely coming back here and trying their other awesome looking dishes. I have a feeling they're as good if not better than what I just had. The place is very clean, simple yet trendy, flavours of the east and west mixed well all over the place and then topped with good background Afghani music that matches the food cooked on charcoal you're consuming. 

Good job and wish them success at this difficult corner of this street. Lots of other businesses before them had come, tried and failed, many times that I've lost count. I'm bored seeing that kind of unpleasantness. Hope they'll stay here for a long time, prosper and become a permanent fixture. Good luck!"

If you are celebrating, and looking for a great meal or great service, this won't be the place for you. The chicken parmigiana was just okay as well. Your Mom's home cooked is probably better, but it wasn't the worst thing in the world. The hoagies are a bit over cooked in the oven, but they taste okay. Sauces cost extra here, which is okay with me. Their ranch wasn't the best, which is disappointing as most Italian restaurants have amazing homemade ranch. The provolone sticks were the worst, and had no flavor. I would stay away from those. However, I saw Pizza on the table next to me that looked very good.

I didn't realize that is what happed last year (we made the appointement in July also).  Thankfully my truck has ac.

And it didn't take long to get the results either.  On top of that every member of the staff was kind, helpful, and very compassionate.  I've always been leery of these urgent care type places because you wait forever and often get treated like cattle.  This place couldn't be more different.

Pourtant ayant vГ©cu en Afrique,  j'avais une assez bonne idГ©e de ce qu'on y vendait parce qu'on me parlait de plusieurs articles et mets vendus sur place Г  saveurs Exotiques qui m'Г©taient assez familier.

D'abord, sans surprise , on y trouve tous les articles habituels d'un super marchГ© : Fruits et lГ©gumes, Viandes, CГ©rГ©ales, pains, boissons et autres articles divers. Mais le choix de ces articles est beaucoup plus diversifiГ© , au delГ  des marques qu'on a l'habitude de voir aux MГ©tro, IGA et autres. Ensuite il y a , bien distinctivement , une poissonnerie, une boulangerie, une boucherie et le petit ( GRAND) truc de plus qui le place immГ©diatement au delГ  de la plupart des super marchГ©s ( mГЄme le Costco) est un comptoir-restaurant des plus attrayants . Dans ce comptoir-resto on y retrouve plusieurs mets et plats faits sur place...des plats de riz, pГўtes, de viandes, des amuses gueules Г  saveurs exotiques ( notamment des Mets Arabes/MaghrГ©bins et ArmГ©niens ) : pГўtГ© de viandes, rouleaux croustillant au fromage, feuilletГ© aux Г©pinards et au poulet et j'en passe. J'y ai mГЄme aperГ§u du Pesto , Hummus  et l'ahmajoun ( pizza armГ©nienne ) , trois mets que j'adore , fait maison que je serais certaine d'essayer une prochaine fois ! Г‰galement, il y avait dans ce comptoir-restaurant une crГЄperie avec un choix divers de smoothie et autres desserts. Il y a TELLEMENT PLUS Г  dГ©couvrir, un endroit qui en vaut le dГ©tour peu importe ou vous habitГ© !!! Personnellement, je pourrais y passer des heures et facilement  laisser ma gourmandise l'emporter pour  y dГ©penser quelques centaines de dollars. 

En bref Chez Adonis, on peut y faire nos emplettes bouffes de la semaine, ce procurer le diner du soir, acheter un lunch si on a la chance de travailler Г  proximitГ© ou simplement s'acheter quelques gГўteries exotiques. 

Adonis, qui dans la mythologie grecque reprГ©sente un homme d'une beautГ© Г©blouissante , est la mГ©taphore parfaite pour dГ©crire cet endroit, qui est beaucoup plus qu'un marchГ©, c'est un endroit unique en son genre et je crois qu'on a bien de la chance d'en avoir quelques un dans la rГ©gion! D'ailleurs, il y a un plus petit Adonis qui ouvre bientГґt prГЁs du MГ©tro Atwater Г  MontrГ©al, sur la rue St-Catherine !"

That's it.   We are in the final stages of that, and are actually considering legal action against TET. If you read the initial contract when you sign with them, it is a win-win (all in their favor) and ultimately won't refund your money, like they claim.  When I asked TET about the Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure, they said, ""If that is the exit strategy you want to pursue, we can help you with that""  yet they NEVER offered that verbally or in writing as an option for us to choose during the 16-17 month period.  Just form letters, and after paying $4000 initially, then at the end having to pay the dues and late fees anyway (that they told us NOT to pay), PLUS an ADDITIONAL fee for an ADDITIONAL servicing company(?!)

It just seems that every time I visit here, nothing changes.

This store represents Swarovski as a brand in Toronto. It is in the Eaton Centre, it has no choice. I know Toronto isn't what is widely considered an 'International City"", but I've been to bigger and smarter looking locations in cities no one else has ever heard of.
Red is the colour of anger, and that how I feel with each visit because I've never actually been able to get the attention of anyone working here. I tried, I gave this store many chances, because I--like everyone else need cheap, shabby gifts for people who are fooled by this stuff. I only bought one necklace here. It took twenty minutes for the transaction to take place because the dreadful salesgirl keeps skipping me despite being next in queue for service. I was tempted to just snatch one of those unimpressive Christmas tree decorations if it were actually made from crystals. Not that I put any value in a Swarovski crystal. Talk about useless things to do with a natural resource. Where are the plates, goblets, decanters, chandeliers? Take a lesson from Baccarat and stop depleting this planet's precious minerals for....horsefish figurines. Or at least craft them well so that they may serve artistic value. 

The visual merchandising is awkward. It's as if the merchandiser didn't know whether she wanted to display the products for people standing from inside the store or looking in from the corridors. I almost snapped my neck trying to get a proper view of the necklaces. I don't dare coming here more than once a year fearing that I might succumb to RSI (Repetitive Stress Injury). Well, at least the place is brightly lit. Holy crap is this store shiny. That's the only rabbit in the hat for them I guess.

However, after getting my car back and driving it around for a few days, I noticed that my fuel efficiency had dramatically decreased indicating that the thermostat was not performing correctly. I brought my car back to Pep Boys to check out the problem and a representative informed me that the thermostat had NOT actually been replaced and it would cost me the full price to replace the part plus the cost of labor.

She said that we had a time constraint and if she were to go to the front door it would take her an hour to circle back and that she was unable to turn the car around if she dropped us off in the front (all while a similar limo was passing us by on the other side of the road).  She tried to make us feel better by telling us that she dropped all her clients about 1/2 mile away from the door.  After begging her to drive up as far as she could because we were a party of 12 women in high heels, she moved up but still refused to go to the door, so instead of wasting more time,  we walked 1/4 mile to the door.  When it was time to leave, we again had to walk the 1/4 mile back to the vehicle only to find that the car had broken down.  The driver did not call us to let us know as we could have waited inside, not in the cold.  The good news was that the backup vehicle was only 10 minutes away, we got into backup car and drove past the front door, the new driver made the turn the first driver was refusing to make and were on the way home. We were then told we had to stop at a bank because they would not accept anything but cash as final payment. The driver requested the cash as soon as we got back into the vehicle, we asked to close the door because it was cold, he said I'm not closing the door until I count the money.  After counting the money he so unprofessionally said to us, ""the tip is not included in the fee.""  (Aren't tips usually earned and given at the end of a transaction?) After we told him why we were not tipping at the moment, he said, ""Oh well, I guess nothing I can do if you don't want to tip me nothing I can do.""  Thinking it's finally over, upon exiting the bank parking lot, we stop at a light, then see some cars coming at us, he tells us he has to back up now and go the other way because the light was not changing.  What really happened, THE DRIVER DROVE INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD!  When we wanted to talk to him about it, he put up the partition so we couldn't.  We finally reached home and the driver would not drive up the driveway to drop us off.  The experience ended with 12 women in heels walking up a graveled driveway.  In conclusion, if you're looking for a reliable service and someone who will pickup and drop off at your requested location, THIS IS NOT COMPANY TO HIRE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY."
PyCIUFtJd_nvR5lSxrWX3A,3ecz4PRzXXpqkZB6i5UHUw,"Terrible service in the men's section today. When a clerk assumes you are buying something for yourself and then proceeds to mumble through the transaction, it doesn't make you want to give them your business. 

Here's what went down. I was purchasing gifts for Christmas, as one does in a mall in December. Took two items to the till and the clerk looks at them and says ""These are too big for you. You need smaller!"" In the rudest tone. I informed the clerk that they are gifts and get a disgusted grunt. 

After being told I didn't have the Simons points card, the clerk mumbled something unintelligible under his breath and scanned my items in. After completing the transaction (in which the clerk barely made eye contact or conversation) I had to ask about both a gift receipt (no dice on that) and a gift box. The gift box he did give me isn't what I needed. Even though he insisted it would fit. I think I'll order my stuff from Simons online from here on out. What little Christmas spirit I had is definitely gone now."

HHwoMfAReRiuSxQhVjIELw,BfnYXZEfWNdmW9VbWVeg7Q,"This shopping center is an outdoor type where as none of the stores are accessible unless you exit one. 

When they first built South Trail, they had one more entry/exit on the south side. It was located just after the Wendy's, and in between the BP. They never should've barricaded this exit. On weekends if you're at the Co-op for example, you have to exit counter-clockwise out of the shopping area only to end up at two very frustrating four way stops.

They really need to open up that entry/ exit again. At least open the exit to help alleviate the congestion on weekends and evenings. 

Other then that, they have a few good stops for families, ie; Walmart, London Drugs, Safeway. etc."

pwJ02k23oZcu3JFMx43uMA,dfB-XW_RwAcIKmFrZK7U1A,"The Costco of alcohol.  The more you buy, the cheaper it becomes!  They give rebates based on how many bottles you buy (3/6/12), and it doesn't all have to be the same thing.  Not only wine either, spirits as well.  Expensive, cheap, and everything in between!  Whenever I go, I never end up seeing the whole store, as I always end up filling my quota before I've visited the whole store.

Something I like is that its a very different atmosphere than a traditional SAQ store.  While it isn't luxurious in the least, sometimes a change of scenery is good while shopping, as I've discovered wines I wouldn't have otherwise.  I tend to know my local SAQ pretty well, and can walk in and go right to the various sections of wines I know and like.  At the SAQ depot, since I go there much less often, I don't have that familiarity, and that's a good thing (because I'm not running in to pick up something on my way out the door, I'm going SHOPPING!).

I made the mistake of going one of the weekends leading up to Christmas.  Yikes!  That was pretty crazy!  But it was still a good experience, just much more hectic than usual."

They have imports too (like coffee, candy, chocolate ... even Persil washing soap).

As an added bonus for local hunters, Paolini's does wild game butchering as well.

meehYhsuxZ8XD-pO2uyxzA,9Ian9ttW3sz5wYfCysIEmg,"Atmosphere B&B was absolutely perfect! Patryck was an amazing host. It was lovely meeting him! The B&B was beautifully decorated and SO CLEAN! When we arrived Patryck explained shoes must be removed when going into your room. I don't have a problem with that since I take my shoes off when I walk in the front door of my home. I was amazed how CLEAN my feet stayed while I was there. (I wish I could say the same for my own home lol). 

I stayed in the Inspiration room which is the smallest room. I originally planned to travel solo but ended up traveling with a friend. The room was still big enough for both of us. I was a bit concerned about not having a private bathroom, but never had a problem...well once...but I didn't have to wait long :) otherwise the bathroom was always available. This was my first experience sharing a bathroom...but it was all good.

Everyone raves about the breakfast and I understand why. THREE COURSES! Who can eat that much food? The breakfast was amazing and I felt bad because I could never finish everything! Patryk asks you what time you would like to have breakfast and BAM it's done. He cook everything himself with some help from a young man.

The location was phenomenal. You're walking distance from Beaudry station (approx. 10 minutes of walking) so it's super convenient. We were so close to The Village - I liked they have the street blocked off for pedestrians only in the summer time. It was always crowded with different types of people. The Latin Quarter is an easy walk as well. 

There's also a bike rack/rental right in front of the B&B if you're so inclined. I didn't try the bikes but would love to next time I visit. It's a very bike friendly city.

I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in Montreal!!! Thank you Patryck for a wonderful stay in Montreal!!!"

While I was about to give up, a friend brought me to World Dance Center where Rodrigo and Wendy were the instructors.  I felt something different and I gave myself a last chance.
It's not just the teaching technique and skill, it's about their devotion. (I have been teaching at school and college, I know what I am talking about). It's the teacher.
Rodrigo and Wendy are not just professional, they have done more than any teachers I've come across.  Even I've never learnt dancing before, I fall in love with this arts.
I cannot tell you everything, but one needs to come to their class to feel it.
I don't expect to be a performance artist but I feel confidence to dance on any dancing floor with friends.
If anyone who really want to dance and learn the skill, I strongly encourage you to take the first step.
If anyone who wants be become a professional, they are more than qualified to teach.
Thanks to my best friend Alfredo, he's not in the country now, who stopped me leaving the class.  Otherwise, I would never know how to dance.
Dancing like anything, need practice too, there's social time that we practice with anyone.
Lastly, it's is extremely affordable.  $12 for a class but we can pay $50 for 10 classes with a punch card that we can use for any classes.
Not only it's an arts, it's also excellent exercise for any age to stay young and energetic.  Whenever I'm in town and I can make it, I will go.
Hope to see you there."

ACE were the movers the government contracted to do our overseas move. They came the day before our move and started packing us up. I am very happy with how they packed the boxes, never sparing on materials to pad the items. They wrapped everything including the furniture before they put it in the crates. Today when they came, there were seven people working on our house!!! They even came to our storage unit to pack it up as well. It's 104 degrees and they never stopped, just kept going until the job was done. I appreciate them so much for all their hard work!!!"

She and her sister have many umbrella companies in order to avoid fraud.  She is not a CPA either, nor are most tax prep persons.  Minimal certification required in the tax business.  She scammed me out of $500 cash to re-file an improperly done 2012 tax return where she added too many education credits, while I was in graduate school.  I asked her to meet me at the downtown IRS office because it was a bit odd,  and I did not assume anything further because we were in a federal building.  She is a drug addict and is divorced from her former business partner/husband Chris.  Google Sophia and her last name and it will show her sister did time in jail for similar drug, con, and white collar related crimes.  I ended up paying the IRS over $3k with interest."

The staff could not have been more pleasant or helpful. When asked if I needed help and answering that I was looking for a white duvet cover, Barb showed me all of the white duvet covers in the store.  There was no pressure to buy, but rather I was left to my own devices to browse and think.  I ended up buying a lovely cover and my check-out experience was handled efficiently and again was very pleasant. I also checked out the outlet store a few doors down and again the staff member was pleasant and helpful. I cannot wait to go back!"

After spending a lot of time on the phone, I was finally told that both reservations were in my ""account"" and I qualified for one night free if booked by 4/22/15.  On 4/22/15, I called to make another reservation and was told that only one night had been credited, that there was no way to verify my stay (although I kept telling them that I had the receipt in my hand), and that there was no supervisor available to help me with this problem.  I was on the phone for close to 30 minutes before finally giving up.  Whenever possible, I will not stay at a Choice Hotel due to this terrible customer service."
6spBxiPv7cq3Zy0gSeQsEQ,MEi50txl4EpJXEEcwx6-tg,"Lived at this place for about a year; couldn't wait to leave. The place is starting to show its age and they have put no money back into it. The first week I moved in I had an infestation of yellow jackets. Upon contacting the front office they acted as if; one, it was no big deal and I was just making a fuss and two, complete shock that there would even be any yellow jackets in there. Upon chatting with the neighbor and telling him about my ordeal he mentions ""oh the last people who lived there had yellow jackets too!"" I once again contacted the front office and informed them that this unit has been struggling with this problem for a while now. I was told they couldn't get orkin for about a week so I would have to stay in the unit or find other accommodations on my dime. (Thinking back I should have accessed legal council at that time) Being that I am not from the area and have no friends or family around. I had to suck it up and sleep in the smaller bedroom in an air mattress while being 5 months pregnant. So orkin came and yellow jackets went away, but the whole thing took about a week and a half. 

The community has ""rules"" that are meant to keep the place clean and comfortable for all who live there. The ""rules"" however are not enforced by management staff. Example people leave garbage on their porch so they don't have to drive it to the compactor every day and garbage smells and it looks awful. (btw they charge you $15 a month for the pleasure of driving your own garbage to the compactor and on weekends it get so full that people just leave it on the floor around the compactor) another rule is parking on the street. A lot of people have made the street their permanent parking space. It looks tacky but most of all it sucks to have to go around these cars when driving home specially in the winter while its snowing. The most dangerous one is that they allow all size dogs to move into the place, but don't make people keep them in there homes. so at times you will be approached by a very large dog and no owner in sight. 

The gym at village at Avon is as old as the property. The machines are definitely worn and should be replaced. The ""business center"" has an ancient printer that is broken half the time or out of ink the other half. I was told by one of the young ladies who works there to take out the cartridge and shake it. 

The water bill is not your own personal usage is a large amount used by the whole community and the divided by the amount of people that live in the units (very complicated, I actually after a year of living there am still not very sure how it works) bottom line is you have no control over your water usage and your bill could be $15 dollar one month and $50 the next. when I asked why my water bill sky rocketed to $56 dollars (The highest we ever paid for a home with 2 people) the office staff said ""well its summer time and people do things like wash there cars"" well that's great !

Village at avon has also seen a recent increase in crime. The office staff blamed it on the economy. The crime made the news, here is a link http://avon-oh.patch.com/articles/police-officer-s-badge-handcuffs-taser-and-rounds-taken-from-village-at-avon

We had a dryer that was broken it was shaking and making airplane like noises ( we even made video and showed it to the front office staff ) it took 3 visits from maintenance and 2 months to get a new dryer put in. 

At the end of our lease they increased our rent by $155 (13% increase) a month. An increase that big should be justified by upgrades to the property/unit and things of that nature. So we decided to move to another place not to save money ( we moved to a place with higher rent) but because we felt that place was not worth the money we were paying and it definitely not worth the increase. The place is ran like a circus. In the year I lived there it had 3 different property managers. The kicker of the whole story is that upon moving out we got a bill for carper replacement of $400. The carpet should have been replaced many years ago and now they will finally do it, but I will be paying for it instead of them. When I asked when the last time that carpet was replaced the manager told me that ""it doesn't matter if it 6 months ago or 6 years ago"".They told me there was ""gooey dots"" on the carpets that couldn't be removed so the whole carpet would have to be replaced. The problem is that they don't hire professional carpet cleaners to come in and clean the carpet (like most companies do) they have the maintenance staff do a best they can job and when they can't they just charge you for a new carpet. Upon move out I was also charge $15 for ""drip pans"" (those things in the stove that things ""drip"" into) They apparently expect your drip pans to look new when you move out and if they don't they will charge a marked up rate for them."

M5A5r0HbMRfTzidqMKYHfw,9tyUFs6YEfzJ0MIG3ClkRQ,"After trying their ribs once as take-out, I was impressed enough to return for a meal in the restaurant. The reviews that I read here complained about their service mostly but I must say that Liz was covering the tables like a blanket. Her helper served us our drinks as soon as we sat down. Liz came to give us the menu and left us alone for a few minutes. Then she was there to take the order. The food came within 10-15 min and the owner came to make sure everything was OK. During our meal, Liz was there at least 3 times to see if we needed anything. I do not know what else one can expect in terms of service in any restaurant. As for their ribs, they were SUPERB, by far better than the famous chains and definitely up there with Rollins, if not better. The sides were very good as well. If you are worry about your weight, do not order the best side dish they have. That would be the sweet potato casserole. The cole slaw and french fries were a little better than average. There is no attampt to create any atmosphere here. The emphasis is food and it is very good. Their recent nomination as the best ribs in town is well deserved. They also deserve more clients to make sure that they stay open in Henderson for me :)."

The staff is friendly, the dentist is great and personable, and they do great work.

I first wandered through the aisles and not too long after meandering around with an undoubtedly confused look on my face, Marshall asked if there was anything he could help me with.  I initially declined his help (because who likes to admit they're lost?) I eventually found what I was looking for and short after had a question regarding it.  I approached Marshall again and instead of being irritated or bothered that I turned him away earlier only to turn around minutes later to ask a question, he graciously helped me.

I then explored the aisles some more to find other things I needed.  When I was unsuccessful, I came across Nathan who cheerfully escorted me to the aisle I needed (of course I had been in the aisle already and the very thing I was looking for was right in front of my face! - He tried to help me by saying they re-organized the store recently so the aisle signs weren't necessarily accurate.  I really appreciated that.... Even though I hadn't actually read the signs originally.  Haha.)

I finally made my way to the cash register where I was helped by Michael who was patient with the return/exchange of my online order.  

The only pitfall is that the air conditioner doesn't work very well; so, if  you're looking for relief from the summer heat, you won't find it here.

But you know what?  I had such positive service, I can't even dock them a star for lousy A/C.

If I need any supplies last minute, this will definitely be my stop!"

They need to be more upfront and honest about what they can and can't offer so that people who are considering this school can decide if it's the best place for them.

Dialna is a wonderful and friendly receptionist that is always accommodating to your schedule. Dr. Hall is extremely friendly and personable. He has really helped me a lot with my back pain. He not only gives you adjustments but also shows you exercises to keep your back in good shape. He has also helped me with knee pain and even wrist pain from carpal tunnel. He taped up my wrist just the other day and provided me with immediate relief, which also saved me an additional trip to the doctor's office. He fitted me for orthotics which have really helped my foot and back pain. He's really several doctors in one. Overall, they treat you based on your individual needs and not how much your insurance can be drained for. If you're improving then they don't make you continually come back if it's not needed, which is something that I've experienced at other practices. And last but not least, there's a little shitzu dog named Yoshi who wonders the office some days and he's always looking for a handout from the treat bowl.

Here's the drill, you choose a meat (jerk chicken, jerk pork, curry pork, oxtail, goat, stew, etc.) and it is served with a side of rice and peas. You can also go the roti route for a little extra money. (Check out their website for pictures of the food and a full menu).

I still haven't gotten around to trying their porridge...but I really need to. It's suppose to be pretty great!

This take-out restaurant is small (just a counter), authentic and independently owned so worth checking for that reason. You should definitely stop by if you're in the area (*ahem* Centennial students)."

Ceci dit, pour ceux qui cherchent une bonne pizza et/ou une bonne poutine, je suggГЁre d'Г©viter ce resto grec. De plus, je dois avouer que leurs souvlakis sont plus qu'ordinaire, merci ! 

Je vais chez Corvette Express pour mes petits dГ©jeuners, car les prix sont trГЁs abordables et c'est Г  2 coins de rue de chez moi ! Ils sont efficient (montrons qu'on a du vocabulaire.... Je suis allГ© dans les meilleurs Г©coles quand mГЄme) et sympathique. Quand je suis trop poquГ©, comme ce matin, je n'ai qu'Г  m'assoir et me laisser servir sans que j'aie Г  passer ma commande.

Question tolГ©rance, je dois souligner  leur patience Г  mon Г©gard. J'y ai fait tout ce qu'il ne faut pas faire dans un resto sans aucune consГ©quence. Ils m'aiment quand mГЄme (du moins, j'en ai l'impression..... non, ne brisez pas mes illusions.)

On y mange quoi ?
1- des dГ©jeuner classiques ;
2- des hamburgers sans frites (faite comme moi, achetez une fritte ailleurs et amener les pour emporter) ;
3- le hamburger steak avec salade et riz.... remarquez que j'Г©vite encore les frites
4- les hotdogs "" steamГ©s "" toujours sans frittes.

Pour le reste, c'est Г  vos risques et pГ©rils, mais se sera toujours pas cher, pas cher :)
 
Je rГ©serve les 1 Г©toile pour des endroits snobs comme le Lawrence sur St.-Laurent ou, oui, c'est bon, mais c'est trop cher pour ce que c'est, et qu'ils nous servent avec une trГЁs mauvaise attitude ! Au moins, chez Corvette Expresse, ils sont sympathiques..."

I checked the sales flyers of various pet stores in the area prior to stopping.  I was in search of cat litter and food specifically.  The prices were competitive, and due to the location, I decided to stop.  The place was very clean and well organized.  I found exactly what I was looking for quickly.  The store wasn't overly crowded.  Therefore, I was able to walk around and browse freely.  Getting through the checkout was quick and easy.  The person working the checkout was very friendly, and the bagger actually walked my cart out for me, and helped load my litter and food into my car.  Took my cart back, too.  BIG PLUS+++!  I will definitely check here first for my pet needs."

Well,let me tell you, it worked! My student masseuse  Linda was FABULOUS! She had a firm, but not painful touch, and she asked me throughout if the pressure was right for me. She honored my wishes of not massaging my legs; but to pay more attention to back and shoulders.
It was well worth the drive over there from the strip, and I would visit again the next time I'm in town.
They are Very professional and created an enjoyable experience."
YSNOIcgfMlsRVTWwoSGuuQ,NaW6r6e2dwXSv5qLrL7ZkQ,"Rooney is a pricey yet, stylish boutique offering cool fashion for both genders. I love their selection of Barbour jackets, Gitman shirts and Alden footwear. Somethings are a little ridiculous like $160 for a pair of shorts. There are cheaper ones however, but still...

Service is only okay, I would expect a store with this price point to offer perhaps a little more friendly service. At least paying at the till was fast.

Take advantage of their sales that happen once in awhile to offset the high pricetags here!"
-QuusedOBuIdCOKHR161HQ,3yasGDcSNAtlW2zmDFDlLA,"I literally fell in love with this small cute coffee place It perfectly fits the Old Montreal neighbourhood. After a long walk when you need a short brake this place will be a great opportunity to recharge your energy with a cup of delicious coffee and a dessert. 
The interior is very stylish with many elements of French heritage. Small pictures with historical figures are decorating the walls inside, which is nice to descry seeping your beverage. 
The cafe has a store inside with hundreds of different sweets and types of chocolates. 
I think that my trip to Montreal wouldn't be complete without visiting this coffee place."
__MDkJssJAipFrJ36Kg1Hw,y4ZPnZXIc2tccmyR_CMNfQ,"Worst store ever.  From the store manager to Luke the print and copy guy these people are awful.  Take hours to print things, when it actually happens.  Most of the time they conveniently don't check their store email.  This last time I asked for copies for my classroom.  The free printables clearly stated for classroom use.  However another clause also said not to be overproduced and altered.  Apparently printing copies for a second grade wasn't something Luke decided to do."

Secretly I was happy about it because I strongly disliked my Iphone 5. Sometimes they have used phones for sale and I needed a spare for my business calls as well. But they were out of stock. Which was completely understandable. They were so personable over the phone. 

I bought a nice iPhone 6. Then my husband's phone started giving him trouble and I knew it had to be from the lint in his pocket. Sure enough that was the issue and they fixed it for free. And we were totally prepared to pay to have this fix. So happy they treat you like family there. While no one wants their phone to fail on them I can't wait to do business with them again. Thank you so much."

They told me I have to wait for  minimum 20 minuets ! And my little boy was crying and tired. But the cashier didn't really care , it couldn't take her MORE than 5 second to inflate his ballon.
I like party city but I don't recommend this location at all specially if you going with children."

The so called agent was soooo rude and to good for any of us ""little ""people. All she talked about was how awesome her ulgy daughter was. Yes, she said her daughter was ulgy. Really? I asked them what the percentage of kids they put to work in a month and year. She looked at me like i was crazy and said, mama we don't work like that. I just cannot give you that info. You need to buy comp cards and then we might call you for an audition. Ok, so the comp cards are $800 for 40 and for kids you need to get them two times per year. Really?

They don't have as big a selection, but what they do have is very good.  Well made, creamy ice cream with the extra bits mixed in right in front of you.  And the people here are quick too.  The girl who made my rocky road must hold a record of some kind, because wow."
mxZQQwT8VkoPGH0-1pbXZQ,3zXAcfXeSOrxV2MUffe7kw,"Was very disappointed in my order this evening. I have ordered from Pasquale Pizza many times Over the years, but tonight they completely blew it. I ordered at 5:27 PM and was told the order would be delivered within an hour. Call back after an hour and a half they told me that the delivery was in the car on the way to the house. Called back again after two hours and was told again that the delivery was in the car and on the way to my house. Called a third time after three hours waiting and was told that I had never placed the delivery order and that there was nothing in their computer system saying that I have ever ordered from them before. Needless to say They lost a long time customer tonight. 

UPDATED REVIEW - I decided to give Pasquale Pizza another chance, as I was craving a spinach feta pizza. This time they took the order correctly, and delivered the food in a timely fashion. Everything was good and the pizza was great"

Supercuts does the same for $10.  Wife color was $160, overpriced and they did not even style her hair after!  11 yo son also got a cut, no extras, still $19.  Low value here folks, stay away and go elsewhere.  Watched them take better care of their Asian clientele only."

I also feel that he has the customer's best interest at heart because he actively tries to find and price out the best deals or will give hints on when things go on sale. Initially I wanted to avoid this store because of the ""chain"" stigma and instead I used to visit some smaller local businesses however Zach's customer service oriented approach and their competitive pricing have changed my mind. This will now be my ""go-to"" pool store. Thanks Zach!"

jlayFOu6c6vEiQ2aQPwE8w,XUwYlVRuyoImgtaw8Cjztg,"I haven't experienced any Bootcamp this clean, organized and high energy as this place. The management and staff are AMAZING and very welcoming not to mention the participants in the Bootcamp they were all welcoming and motivational. 
I was introduced to Burn at the Charlotte Heath and Fitness Expo at the Park Expo center in January while involved in a challenge with another organization that had Bootcamp style workouts. I came dressed and ready to exercise as I knew there would be several sample workout sessions available and Thank God I ran into the Burn Camp just in the nic of time. After that experience I was yearning for me and low and behold I ran across a Groupon deal to try bootcamp unlimited for a month at the Pineville camp and I hurried to purchase as I wanted to see if it could LIVE up to the hype I experienced at the expo and so far so GOOD.
I've only attended two classes in the past two days with the class today being one of the childcare provided sessions which is a super PLUS. 
Patrick is the owner/manager of this location and he is Amazing. He takes the time to learn everyone name and address you by name immediately after learning your name. He is also very motivational going around giving High Fives and pushing you to do AMAZING.
As you may know I am not a 5star giver so this means a LOT and as a Elite I hold my stars serious and TRUE. After my 30day trial via Groupon I will see my results and potentially pursue a membership if at a reasonable price. 
I'll update my review after the month trial as I plan to workout at least 25 times in the month and should reap some great results as I am a person who MealPreps and know how to eat often and in portion."

This place is conveniently located next to where my hotel sits. So I found the place to fill up when I drive out of Scottsdale. They have a convenience store and other amenities. But I already know where to get my coffee for the long drive, and I will wait until LA to get a car wash.

We were greeted when we walked in and seated are selves, the bar tender who was the only one working up front came and got are drink orders and gave us menus.  Drinks came out quick just soda and water since we had to go back to work, we ordered are food. I got an order of fries pickles and the steak philly, mu coworkers ordered wing and the other ordered the cheese ball burger and homemade pizza rolls.  This is where thing started going south, we ordered are food at 2:30ish and did not get it till 3:05 which usually an hr lunch gives us plenty of time for a sit down lunch.  I got my fried pickles first which were nicely crispy and well battered but they were very very very greasy and served with buffalo ranch which i did not enjoy because it is tangy vinegary pickles with vinegary buffalo ranch was not a good combo regular ranch would be just fine.  My coworkers pizza rolls looked amazing and he said they were amazing.  As far as my philly cheese steak it was sub par,  the roll was very nice there was not much in the way of peppers onions or mushrooms, the meat was super greasy and over salted oh and i could not find the garlic mayo.  On a plus side the frys were great and i could have eaten a whole plate of them.  My coworker that got the burger said it was very good and cooked to his order, the one who got the wing was very disappointed said the mild sauce had no flavor at all and the garlic parm only tasted like parm.  Overall service was good, the kitchen brings this place down.  If the food was prepared a touch faster and some more attention to seasoning and letting grease drain off some of the fried food it would be much better.  This was not a great experience but i will give them another try in the future to see if i can up the rating."

Long story short, I now look like a cross between that creepy berries and cream Skittles guy and Seto Kaiba because after this guy asked if I wanted the back cut (literally one of the first things I asked for) and needing to interrupt him trimming my bangs (I didn't tell him to do anything with them!), I just told him to finish a few half-finished cuts for damage control, payed, and left.

No letter, no phone call and no notification that they had done so until I discovered they had just terminated the account after I went into this TDCanadaTrust branch.

 They absolutely refused to re-open the account, even after I pleaded with this branches manager.  Unbelievable actually.  Complete customer service FAIL.  I find it a real head-scratcher as to why they would treat their long term customers like this. Don't they realize we are internet and social media friendly/savvy (some of us VERY active) and VOCAL?!   I had over-draft protection on the account that was closed, another joint account  with them and even a 3rd account - a $179,000 line of credit.

  Because of this ridiculous and ignorant decision I very likely will be pulling all my business and taking it to another financial institution all together.  I also sell real estate full time in Toronto and the GTA for my living, and will definitely NOT be sending them any future mortgage business (not that I do much with TDCanadaTrust anyway as their mortgage rates they offer always seem to be one of the highest rates quoted when my buyers shop for a mortgage rate).  Why would I want my clients subjected to this lack of customer service?! 

 I definitely left this branch not a happy camper!  Several days later I called the branch no less than 4 times throughout the day.

efKt0pS0d83aJ5KXupy16Q,Cs4excPQNO9gTVbeAD2dNg,"Bill and Taso are brothers. I started to take lessons for bouzouki and guitar, with both of them, 13 years ago. They did not have Elite Music Academy 13 years ago. 

I still remember the half hour drives to their home where they had a mini studio set up in the basement. It had everything. We even used TAPES to record our music lessons back then. Yes Taso! I Still have them all and I'm almost scared to listen to them because I was 12-14 when they were recorded. 

I was never without proper instruction. Taso always did his best to explain things. I put him through a lot having to reexplain the same topics over and over week after week. If he were to ask me about those same topics now, I can reiterate them in great detail on multiple levels. His teachings were simple and they have been ingrained in all that I do musically. Taso and Bill showed real enthusiasm and understanding when working with me and nothing has changed since then.

They both care deeply about my progress as a musician, and even now when I walk into the store for something small like picks, Bill will get off his chair and assist me personally for as long as I need him, and we'll have a long chat about everything. These guys know about service and will do anything it takes to make you, not only happy, but leave smiling. Sometimes I pop in for a laugh or two. Their good for it and its on the house. Ask Taso to tell you a joke. He always has one on hand ready to go. If he doesn't make you laugh, it will be a sad day for Toronto!

They have grown their small business idea and plan into a HUGE success from almost nothing. I wish them the very best in all of their ventures as I have from the very beginning. 


I love you guys. Keep doing what you do!

B_UMuPhtELFcOAaIWJBPtA,V258KQ1Jte5UZ9L2aM6vow,Ashley is a dear. I'm older & have always had my hair permed because it's so straight & fine with no body or curl. She loves doing all kinds of hair & it shows. She's a perfectionist! I came out with soft conditioned healthy curl. She has experience in all kinds of desires & is intent on satisfaction. I absolutely recommend her. You'll NOT be disappointed! Thank You Ashley! Jan

On the day of the walk through after the painting was done, we walked so quickly through the house that I didn't get a chance to inspect things as I had hoped.

Ask for style tips and you can get some decent advice on accessories, of which they sell in the store. A few cases are filled with jewelry from local designers and they have gloves, belts, shoes and bags, too. The mens section is nearly as big as the women's, making this a great stop for couples on the way down Queen on a shopping spree."

BUDGET IS A SCAM - keep all receipts - make sure addresses are on receipts are they will deny them. WORST experience EVER! HORRIBLE customer service. They charged me for not filling up the tank and when I called Mary accused me of trying to pull a fast one saying MOST customers disputing gas charges conveniently ""forget"" then try to get out of the charge the next day. She did everything but call me a liar.. I went down in person and Hope argued with me about Mary claiming I was trying to scam them for the gas. Claiming Hope was there when I spoke to Mary on the phone. Flat out argued with me saying no she didn't every time I clearly explained to her the details of the conversation. condescendingly.. Then FLAT out refused to take my receipt and kept arguing relentlessly with me. They CLAIM THEY filled the tank up the next morning exactly 8.3 gallons. I went 102 miles. Trucks get 8-10 miles a tank. I showed her my receipt she claims the receipt didn't show the address of the gas station. I said if the truck was given to me on a full tank and only 102 miles were put in the truck and my receipt says 8.6 gallons were put in the truck then obviously the gas station was within 2 miles of them. Hope asked me to leave the store and told me if I had a problem to call customer service. Cust serv hung up on me TWICE - said they didn't believe this happened that the stores have no way to overcharge, yet they charged me for gas I already put in the truck. Then asked me to email a fake email address the receipts and it auto rejected the email then I called back and they said they gave me the wrong email no one had heard of the email they originally gave me. Then gave me another email and no one ever responded. Impossible to get through. Please tell me how THEY put in gas to a truck and I have a receipt for putting almost that exact amount in as well. Who's the liar here? Where is your receipt? I have given you guys my receipt in person, in an email and now on here. Yet you still stole my money saying I did not fill up the tank.

4zeJMGf3m9ghWjWB2sZMWg,exVoGdv_J1KYwD5CuFO7eg,"We initially wanted to try The Vertigo Games because of it's good reviews on Google, Trip Advisor, and Facebook, and then we also found a Groupon. 

First off, it was kind of hard to find the location (even though their Yelp page says it's easy to find) since Chesswood Dr is a pretty dark street to begin with at night, plus you can barely see  the company name. Upon entrance, we were greeted by the friendly owners (this is a family owned business). 

First time we came, we tried the pyramid themed room. It was really fun and unique. Seemed to be pretty easy compared to the other escape rooms we've been to, especially since we didn't need any hints. Afterwards, we wanted to try the other rooms but some groups prior had taken apart some of the parts to the room and staff had to call their engineers to fix the problem. That's okay, we figured we would come back considering how much fun we had.

Second time we came, we tried the Dragon themed room. These next few comments doesn't have anything to do with the room but I found it pretty much...Basically, I needed to use the washroom before we started the game. The moment I walked into the washroom, it felt like it was an escape room within the washroom. The first door lead to a room with the sink and the light switch wasn't beside the door so I had to look around to find it. Finally, I found it, flicked the switch, and the light turned on in the next room...which was where the toilet was. Within the room where the toilet was, you can tell there was supposed to be another door there that probably goes into one of the escape rooms, but they sealed it off. By the time I had to wash my hands and then dry them, the dryer had a light underneath that looked like a UV light...it's like I was trying to escape the washroom and there was some sort of code on my hands that I needed to find :P LOL. Pretty funny I must say when you're already prepared to do an escape room xD

Anyway, the Dragon's room wasn't up to par in comparison to the pyramid themed room. Some of the sensors/certain clues or locks weren't opening even though we had the right combination or answer. It made us stuck a few times until the staff came in and tried to help us. Kind of a waste of time since we had the right answer but some of the sensors weren't working.

All in all, we had fun. We will most likely be back to try the haunted house and the new room they're hoping to open in the future (Therapy Room). Staff are very accommodating and friendly. We even did a company exchange so they can advertise our business and we can do the same for Vertigo Games. I would totally recommend to try out this place especially if it's your first time trying an escape room!"

Ps0UJeCsZXW3lk8xleT78g,X2KHd_jY66BjvuSgPt_a_w,"The first Saturday of every month is PARENTS NIGHT OUT, from 6pm to 10pm. At $15 for 4 hours of babysitting, it's the best deal in town. 

We had our son's birthday party here and he had a blast. Twice the # of children who we expected came, and since these places typically charge penalties for added children you can see how that would add up. These prices were established on their website, and our problem was with the inconsiderate parents who brought their entire families to play or did not RSVP, not with the establishment.  Since they have a limited and allotted time for each party, I didn't mind their methods of wrapping up the party. I didn't want to infringe on another party's time and I was aware of the time we had (2 hours TOTAL).

I really like the owners, I appreciate them not being afraid to scold my child if he needs it. He is quite the handful and they've always been able to take care of him during parents night out. 

They have a TV area if you decide to drop in and play. Take advantage of this place for date night and/or getting children activities in during our hot summers. Support our small businesses."

We needed a professional, and James came recommended.  It was a fantastic choice.

When we ran into a snag, he solved the problem in a calm manner and handled the refiling with aplomb!  Thank you very much."
R34i-9i-bo83im6OMiE_JQ,sIrvVy-IFimGgyB1nVXE_Q,"A museum of Canadian history in downtown Montreal. It has an interesting mix stretching back to the First Nations and forward to modern Canadian culture (including a table hockey game), with interesting exhibits on immigration and the language divisions in Montreal. It's not a massive museum, the sort of thing you could pack in on a lazy morning before lunch or over a couple of hours in the afternoon.


 Its closest competition is the Pointe-Г -CalliГЁre museum in the Old Port. The McCord doesn't have the same impressive building or setting as the latter, but it's cosier and the collections are just as interesting. I think the distinction is that Pointe-Г -CalliГЁre focuses on the history of the region, whereas McCord's remit includes the whole of Canada.

They provided excellent advice - better than some chains - and helped by testing the water from the tank. Bought some cool ornaments for the tank at decent prices!

I booked my move months in advance for our 4 bedroom house and went over many details of what we needed to move on the phone. On the day of our move Tom Trucker crew arrived with a small truck, like a cube van! No way was all of our stuff going to fit. I was really stressed out, the crews were difficult to deal with and stood around saying nothing outside while I tried in vain to reach their office by phone. They said they would have to do 2 trips, charged by the hour, and our new house was an hour away!!! They smoked incessantly and one mover was chugging strong booze out of a take-out coca-cola cup (at 9am). They started loading up our stuff, and were able to reach their boss on the phone although he wouldn't answer for us. He had them take our stuff somewhere until it could be sorted out (yes, exactly, they were worried we wouldn't pay). We finally got a call from the owner who said to me, not politely, that they only do half house moves, didn't I know that??? They were not equipped to move whole houses, only half houses. I told him that this was ridiculous and that at no point in any of our many conversations did I indicate that I would like to move only half my stuff! We kicked up enough of a fuss that another truck finally arrived a few hours later... Our move took all day until the evening. It was a horrible day. Go with a reputable company!

BUT taking their customer service in consideration (which was 1 star at its best) I couldn't give them more then 2 stars in total. Their staff seemed to have fun with regulars, not paying attention to new customers at all. They might be underpaid employees though, since I noticed they rang in 8 items for me even though I purchased 6 items only. This was an extra 10 bucks charge for nothing. I'm very disappointed.

I work at Collier and frequently visit L1M for coffee, soda, or an occasional sandwich.  It's quick, easy, inexpensive.  However, on this particular Thursday, I took a chance on the daily special, the El Dorado grilled sandwich. I selected marble rye, and pepper jack cheese to go with the roast beef and roasted green chili's.  I must point out that this was not a sandwich I would normally select. Chicken and turkey are my main options. 

The sandwich was ready in minutes, and came with a selection of one side.  I chose potato salad. 

The El Dorado was amazing!  The perfect balance of roast beef slices, green chili slices, and very melted cheese. The grilling was great. No sloppy dressing pouring out of the edges, crispy, and wrapped in what appeared to be parchment, yo keep it crispy. 

WOW!  I've had good, mediocre, and really bad sandwiches.  This was the second one that was GREAT. If you don't stop by and try this Shame!  Shame! Shame!  It's amazing"

So we arrive on Sat an hour before departure, our friends checks with the clerk inside and was told that this is their bus and they are on time. So we then proceed to wait in line to get their bags checked in and when we get to the guy packing the luggage he says our they on the list? Now we ha e no idea what he was talking about and he then said to go inside and see if they were on the list. Our friend then went inside again mind and asked. She was then told that she had to call a day prior to save her a seat and that having a ticket will not guarantee her a seat. This is total bullshit, not one employee from el paso nor las vegas advised us of this and we were looking at having her stuck in vegas for another day. To some one day might not be much, but for us it means missing a day of work due to how long the drive is (12hrs) and that means one day less of pay. The bus condition is poor at best, the a/c can't keep up and it stays warm and therefore leaving a smell of b.o. and left over bathroom potpuri. I would figure if you can buy your ticket and reserve your seat mind you that you are guaranteed a seat. You pay for your ticket, claim your seat, and the time. There is only one departure. Of I had advice I would suggest that this bus company actually have some planning and stop overselling tickets. We witnessed a family of four that could not go on due to no seats available. If you need to catch a bus choose another company. Only saving grace was the bus driver himself, he was kind, caring, and the only reason our friend made it on that bus and on her way home."

Had paid for the appointment at drop-off... BIG MISTAKE . Got a call saying my 10 pound dog wouldn't stand still so they couldn't finish the haircut. What Does that even mean? You're a groomer right. He has been groomed at other locations his whole life and never have I ever been told of a single problem. Husband picked the dog up and I wish I could post the picture! His body is shaved... Legs are not touched... Head not touched a bit... and smells like our shampoo which means wasn't washed! Upon calling the shop I was told my money would not be refunded because He had some mats and if I go to the vet and get sedatives then we could work out the price on his next ""sedated"" visit. Was then called a ""neglectful dog owner"" and told that I don't know how to treat my dog. Actually Used those specific words! The dog who gets bathed and brushed twice a week minimally. She then ""LOUDLY LECTURED"" me for ten minutes and the first time i tried to get a word in... She HUNG UP ON ME! Was then informed of my husbands concern because the poor baby cried the entire way home in his lap! Sure wish I would have read the reviews before all this. Isn't getting the messiness out your job?

AVhYkxAqQSFqYMSa01hPbQ,E3pXvQwKsPBQGQ7RkLrN3g,"Brought the family here for linner today. My wife and I both ordered the Belly Bomber cheeseburger. A full pound of sirloin beef. My review is pretty much based on the burger alone. Yes this is a very old casino in the older part of Henderson. There's definitely a nostalgic vibe going on here and that's not really a bad thing. I like these smaller and older hole in the wall type places more so then the modern huge casinos.
  So the burger comes with fries and all the fixings. Lots of lettuce, tomatoes and onions. Make sure your hungry because this burger is huge. It tastes pretty good, more like a homemade burger. The fries weren't that great but the whole meal is $4.99. I've had other meals here and they have some really good prices with good portions. Another cool thing about this place is it's rarely busy so you'll usually get seated right away. They are a little slow with taking your order and bringing it the food but that's no biggie to me. I enjoy coming here with the family and plan to make this an irregular go to place to eat from time to time."

After finally gathering everyone together, we drove to the other location to find that one also closed. WTF?! Now you've wasted all of our time for no reason.

Jsg8GsBFKh2q8biRyKGOzQ,KggVp-GaRSC3rttU930woA,"I love the team here! I had Dr. Discont who examined my foot at the Family Foot & Ankle office. Best foot doctor in my opinion! I broke a glass Pyrex container, stepped on it, and got a piece of it stuck in my foot. It was on the bottom of my right foot. He said he would make an incision from the side and not the bottom, so that I wouldn't have any scar tissue on the bottom of my foot. Day of surgery at 5:30am, I had to get in a gown with comfy socks they gave me and had to wear an IV (I hate IVs). They let my mom go in the back with me, which is where Dr. Discont and the anesthesiologist, Dr. Tuddle (warning: he is very cute) came in to meet me. I had to wait awhile before one of the nurse escorted me to the operating room. I woke up sometime later, somewhat loopy from the anesthesia and asked one of the nurses (who was in the operating room with me) for the glass that was in my foot. Pretty cool to see that. Got only one stitch and had to wear an attractive (sarcasm) boot for a week. Elevating it helps significantly with the pain. They made everything go smoothly and were very understanding! They called me several times to make I was alive and that I was recovering well! That's awesome, I loved that. Almost a week after the surgery, I received a thank you post card from them. I would recommend them to everyone!"

It's so easy to call or email when you need anything done.  Sometimes I wait until I have a list of tasks. Pricing is very simple. It's one low price per hour no matter what they do. They can do anything. You can usually get the same worker so they become familiar with your home. They will match the right expert for the job so if they have workers who like painting then you get that skilled worker. I have had rooms painted, things installed, dry wall replaced, etc.... I usually get Tony. There is nothing he can't do. When you call they can even estimate how much time they need to complete the jobs. The workers are very skilled, experienced and totally provide all the tools and cleanup.  They have used their truck to go pickup materials I ordered  from Lowes.  You don't have to help them or supervise them. You can go about your day."

For 25-minutes he educated me on the various types of tea and what would be best suited.  

For years I have always got a stomach ache from Green Tea.  After talking to Justin I believe it was due to the fact I was steeping the tea at the wrong temp, which can create an acidic component.  He gave me instructions on best practices and I purchased a 1/2lb of a particular tea.  

I had my first cup this morning and, for the first time, the tea did not give me a stomach ache.  I am very impressed with the service.  It is safe to say I was thoroughly impressed."

So here goes.

This particular Starbucks is, yes, located in the Country Hills Plaza. I love it cause it's big and because it's not overwhelmingly packed. The staff is wonderful and obviously they serve all my favourite Starbucks goodies.

I also love this Starbucks because once you're done getting your java jolt, there's a lot of stuff you can do in the area. You can go tanning(having a perma-tan, this one's not on the top of my personal To-Do list), you can go grocery shopping, you can rent movies, you can get take out, and the list goes on and on. And if you're feeling gluttonous because you had one too many bites of that delicious Starbucks brownie, then you can go for a pleasant walk in the ravines.

I love Starbucks and I clearly love the Country Hills Plaza... so what could be better than a Starbucks INSIDE of the Country Hills Plaza?!?!?

I literally live in the neighborhood behind the store so it should not take an hour to get a cold pizza.   The last 3 or 4 times we have ordered from them it's been the same thing. Guess this is the last time ordered from here.

I called a month ago and when they told me no new patients, I suggested that they let United Healthcare know so it would update the website.  It's still saying We Care is accepting new patients so I go to the WeCare website to get new patient forms (per their phone message) only to discover they are not accepting new patients.  

It would be nice if their brand new phone system advised they are not accepting new patients and they update the insurance companies that they accept to state this so they don't waste customer's time or their own.  Don't seem like ""wecare"" actually cares about that.  Very frustrating when trying to find a new doctor."

Over the past couple of years, I've experienced some serious miscommunications (or lack thereof) about choices that I made about my investments, including mess-ups with taxes, failure of the financial advisors to complete tasks and requests that we decided, lost messages, etc.  Most recently, I met with one of the financial advisors three months ago to transfer a significant amount of money from one of my accounts into a Roth IRA.  After looking at my Virtual Wallet account this week, there was no evidence that this transfer was made (3 months later!).  I walked into the branch today and the advisor admitted it was his fault and went ahead with the transfer.  I was not happy and upset that this might affect tax situations/filing for this year.  From my experience, I'm not sure I would recommend investing at this branch.  I hope to update this review in the future with a more positive review."

They were quick and Dr. Crouse, who was the chiropractor working that day, saw me immediately. He gave me a quick adjustment and made suggestions to help me with my pain. He also suggested that I get a massage by Sue. She did an AMAZING job on my back and neck and she is one of the sweetest people there. The rest of the office staff was very accommodating and friendly and they took the time to explain everything to me since I had never experienced going to a chiropractor before.

If I'm not too stressed, I'll ask her to work on my face, and every time, the improvement is dramatic. The BP isn't as noticeable  or as bothersome as it used to be.

She has a great eye and good fashion sense for retro and vintage wear and accessories. I liked all the 60 and 70's pieces. Too bad they didn't have my size, I would've probably bought it all. LOL The prices are really reasonable.  

The store is fairly new opened in November. Easy to shop in here. Really clean and it smells good. I think it was the rose scented candles. Much more pleasant shopping here than some of the vintage and thrift shops around town.

The store is organized and clothing and shoes are categorized. So you will find nightgowns in one area, dressy wear in another, western wear etc..Jewelry and accessories are also spread out thru the store.  

Lots of vintage collectibles too. They have a bookcase of Playboy magazines from the 50's - 70's. I bought one because it had a cool cover! There even was one with Marilyn Monroe from 1956. Prices range from 5-15 dollars. I can do that. 

One of the jewelry cases had a lot of turquoise pieces. Another had 70's style. There was a case full of vintage eyewear too. Hats, scarves Lots of stuff but not to the point where it can overwhelming. 

There's just so much cool stuff here. Reminds me of my closet from back in the 60's and 70's. Mom dressed me up in similar styles they had here. Full of bold bright colors, a-line mini dresses, go go boots and all!  Mr. B found a cropped fringe leather jacket for me! In great shape too! All the clothes were in great shape, clean and ready to wear off the rack.

Owner is a sweetheart, friendly and helpful. I was taking sweet time shopping and didn't realize when I walked into the store it was supposed to be closed. I'll be back to check up on Go Vintage again since they put out new things every week."

That said, I almost resented Lammle's because of the fact that the presence of this store doesn't help all the stereotypes. But I had a rude awakening when a friend of mine asked me to come in with him because he needed some western wear for a gig. 

Yes, Lammle's has ALL the western wear you'd ever need for this lifetime, and the next couple. But you know what? I realized that some people just LOVE western wear. This place has quite an impressive selection, the prices are reasonable, and the service is commendable. 

It's a fact ladies and gentlemen: if you need western wear, you come to Lammle's. It's good to know that we have this resource in town, and hey, let's face it, knowing exactly where to go the day before Stampede kicks off is one commodity we can't overlook!"

My BF and I put our items on the counter, and one teenage-ish worker rolled her eyes up and saw us but didn't acknowledge us.  The older one was apparently the MOD.  After a good 10-12 seconds of no acknowledgement, the older one whispers something to the younger one and takes off.  We were never greeted, we never received a smile. . .just a begrudging ring-up of the merchandise.  Is it because we only purchased sale items?

Hawaii v Bradley played first, then Loyola Marymount v UNLV. I kind of expected a larger stadium, due to exposure from watching professional baseball games on TV, but after awhile, it grew on me. UNLV students get in free which is always a bonus. I just flashed my ID card at the gate and walked in.

After the first game, I switched over to the Home side where UNLV would be playing and met a bunch of really nice people, albeit crazy for the love of the game. They were awesome and told me stories about players and baseball, as well as heckling the other team with shouts of ""Hey!"" and barking noises. It was a lot of fun to be in the middle of it all. One kid even got a baseball just for sitting near the dug out with his dad.

The bathrooms were clean and the hot dog I bought at the concession stand was warm and delicious. This was my first college baseball stadium and it was certainly a great one.

This place deserves 0 stars. I rented a car from them, and they overcharged me by $550. I phoned to ask why and they said it was for travel outside the city. The manager is named Sam, he is rude and doesn't give a damn about customers. Look at the other reviews for the Montreal and the Toronto office. Everyone who deals with this company gets scammed. They systematically overcharge customers on their rentals without informing them at the time of the pick up, and for no valid reason. I am disputing the charge with my credit card. They advertise on Expedia with a price $100 cheaper than the competitors, but then they put extra fees on your credit card. They are also very inconvenient, the location is out of the airport, and you need to take a shuttle to get there. 
DO NOT RENT FROM THIS COMPANY EVER!!"

There is no ice machine on the floor, but the room service is very fast and you can ask for a re-fill as much as you need. The hotel bar/restaurant is beautiful and the service was excellent. I told the server it was my birthday and they gave me a personalized dessert and made me feel very special. On the day of checkout, we requested for a late checkout and they were pretty good with accommodating a late check out. Ofcourse, that depends on availability.  However, Check out was fast and easy.

I came here only because Yummy Dumplings was closed for lunch on Wednesday, so I ended up here to satisfy my dumpling cravings. 

I ordered the pork & chives dumplings (boiled) which was so so. The skin was thicker than I'm used to but still acceptable & you get 16 dumplings for $7.99. The XLB soup dumplings came next. It was presented in the usual bamboo steamer and you get 10 small bite size pieces. It certainly wasn't my favourite because the skin was thick & some seemed under cooked. The pork filling was okay but the soup content wasn't very consistent. Some were not replete with soup when biting into them and overall wasn't very satisfying. Also it's typically served with some fresh ginger on the side to make your dipping sauce but they don't here.

I was in the store for a GOOD 20 minutes and not one of the middle aged women that asked me if I needed any assistance, which I did. They were to concerned talking to other customers about social things and introducing one customer to another (the associate obviously knew both of them) and mentioning how they live down the street from each other. I honestly love Pier 1 almost as much as my mother. Pier 1 is also a very large chain and has stores everywhere so you know what to expect when you go in. So I don't feel that rating this company due to its product line but more on how each one does and how they handle their customers. The customer in a retail shop is BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT THING EVER!!! That is where the revenue comes from. The staff of house wives working tonight were by far the worst I've seen of Pier 1 yet.  I wasn't even greeted upon entering of leaving. How hard is it to acknowledge someone when they are in your place of business for 20+ minutes. This is why I am giving 2 VERY GENEROUS 2 starts. I wanted to give them a one but I have hopes that Pier 1 will correct this with their staff and stop the social circles in the work place. I'll be back to purchase things again only due to the fact that I like what they carry and they are close to my new home. I hope for a better experience next time around!"

KZkFsuMusWsKDQnJC0m9Og,5NTj2OmteKfc4Y-coQvsZw,"Please do not go to this chiropractors office. They have a molestor working there. His name is Jeremy. I reported to Dr. Madrid about his disgusting Pervert assistant and he ignored my complaint and the facts which he knew to be true. He also lied to the medical Board. He is not a good doctor.


The events occurred in the month of November. I was receiving treatment for injuries from an automobile accident at Deer Valley chiropractic. There is an assistant who works under the doctor his first name is Jeremy however I don't know his last name. The assistants Behavior towards me was extremely inappropriate. He did make sexually charged comments towards me including calling me hot and very inappropriate behavior and this happened on more than one occasion. he also grabbed me/touched my buttocks when he was supposed to be setting me up to a machine for treatment. He also called me a tramp. He did ask me to expose my body so he could see my tattoo I told him he was extremely inappropriate and kicked him out of the treatment room. He made me very uncomfortable and I felt extremely Violated by his inappropriate and vulgar behavior. He also asked the doctor when I went in for treatment one day if he could have me undress completely I did hear him when I was in the treatment room which I found to be bizarre and extremely inappropriate and it's obvious he wanted to do this for his own sexual gratification there is absolutely no doubt in my mind. These incidences have put me under extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. Also one day when I had to schedule an appointment I called the business line and left a message for the doctor and the medical assistant Jeremy actually texted me from his personal cellphone phone to so called reschedule my appointment and he had told me to come in at a specific time because the time I wanted to come in was not available and the doctor later confirmed that Jeremy gave me the incorrect information as to what time I could come in for my appointment why would he do this? To contact me from his personal number is extremely inappropriate and Unprofessional conduct. When I reported the sexual misconduct to the doctor he confided in me that he was glad I said something to him but as for a formal apology I have never received one. When I reported him to the doctor that he touched my buttocks and displayed inappropriate behavior and also called me a tramp I was under the impression that the doctor would terminate his employment for what he did but he actually didn't do anything and Jeremy still works there. I did try and explain to him that I felt uncomftorable going into the office with Jeremy there but apparently he did not sympathize with me at all because why is this pervert still working there he should be fired immediately! Also I feel the need to repeat that the doctor is completely aware of what happened and he did nothing why is this individual Jeremy, still employed in a medical setting? Also he is aware of what happened not only because I told him but due to the fact that his assistant was very bold In his lewd innapropriate behavior by texting me from his personal number asking the doctor if he could have me undress etc. I also notified the doctor that I received a text from Jeremy that one day the doctor replied ""oh he texted you from his personal cellphone"" very casually as if that is appropriate why did he not confront his employee is it not his duty to do this? No woman deserves to be treated in the vulgar rude gross fashion as I was when I received treatment at this medical practice. Sexual misconduct/harassment is absolutely repulsive in any medical setting and it should never occur!"

The care here is second to none, and having acupuncture available (with Dr. Bryan Myles) as a complementing therapy has definitely facilitated my path to wellness. 

I highly recommend this clinic and all of the practitioners who call RiverSide home!"

Gj7QZ0kV-32MAVhJQsWlmg,Wx7cbLDqYEL3_aVZwh82Ww,"I LOVE the Pita Pit. It's one of my absolute favourite places in the city because not only do they serve reasonably-priced and delicious food, but they serve HEALTHY food. That makes my heart happy.

My favourite thing to order at 'The Pit' is the Garden Pita with Hummus and swiss cheese. OH MY GOD. SO good. 

It's the perfect meal to grab and go. It's not messy, so you can feel assured eating and walking down 17th.

The only thing I wish is that The Pita Pit carried an egg salad pita option. As if that wouldn't be SO good eh?!?!

Ah well, with or without the egg salad, it's STILL the bomb. Hell, I'm heading over right now!"

JJHRUEGjpSbo3DDvVQ0fFw,ndE-VM3o1Tg84LEby1Mcuw,"Great first experience! When the waitress asked if we wanted cheese on our potatoes, we were sold (big cheese fans here). The portions are generous, the staff is polite and the food is delicious! We will be returning often, as I believe we have found the best breakfast joint in Blainville."
G36sLDVLgmhIYt1P8FpXAg,sSZOUgmUiMe2RcRjTzKx6Q,"I was paired with Epic by TD Insurance to repair some damage to our roof. We ended up needed a new roof. Epic was really organized and great to deal with at every stage of the process. I've never had a roof replaced before, but I wasn't left with any problems or issues and everything made sense."
Msa288irSAKdZFSROH-Q4w,dobl-xWQ2dG-07Bb2IGljg,"Highly recommend! Went there on a friday night for our anniversary. We will totally go back. Everything was fresh and hand made. Each plate was unique and astonishingly well priced. We had the paella, brie and caramelized onion flatbread, veggie and chicken spring rolls and the pulled pork tacquitos. The pulled pork tacquitos were absolutely amazing! 
We got the Travelzoo deal, $45 for $90. We tried virtually everything on the menu and we can guarantee everything was good, great or better!
The decor is smart casual. It can be interpreted as awesome for a date or great for a group social outing. There is also a great patio out back, that is  large enough for a group outing.
Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. Service was quick and all our food arrived fresh and hot.
If you live in Durham you have to go here."
ZovSDhXoNk3KZAM-gTbZmw,QcAVlE2Hl2HulKnZqdZqRQ,"This is only getting one star because I cannot submit it without any. Worst haircut I have ever had done. I asked just to clean up my ends a little and maybe some shorter layers in the back but to keep my long layers in the front. The first cut she makes into my layers, she cuts off 4 inches from the left side of my head. Which made those layers so short they don't even go past my eyes. I let her keep going, thinking it would be fixed or at least evened out. IT WASNT! I was in the process of growing my hair out from previously donating it (which I've done multiple times in the past and explained to her). I figured just a quick trim and touch up couldn't go bad at Great Clips. It went horribly. I am very upset. I'm starting my first full time job in a couple weeks. I'm going on a cruise for my birthday. I just turned 21 so there goes wearing my hair down when going out at night for awhile. My options are to either try and grow it out or go and get it chopped off. Haven't decided yet but if I choose to get it chopped off you can be assured it will not be at Great Clips. The stylists name was Tyler."
FZ9e2zVvywILTmLthS_M1w,d58LNadryzbTwX8WmdS_rA,"Okay let's cover this outfits best attributes. Staff are quite knowledgeable and generally are eager to assist you with your concerns. The selection of supplements and natural/organic products are abundant so most likely you'll find what you need here. Now onto the negatives... the prices aren't cheap and are higher then other comparable outlets. Also they have this thing called a customer loyalty program. Let's just say keep your receipts and check your points balance as my account had to be manually ""adjusted"" because their POS system wasn't properly tabulating my earned points correctly. On multiple occasions I had to keep asking the staff to explain why my points balance was ZERO and yet I had a my sales receipts showing all my past purchases? No call or email as promised by management for weeks on end? Finally they updated my account much, much later as the staff/management didn't seem to give a hoot?? They've lost a lot of my business to other alternative healthy food stores as I rarely go back unless it's something specific."

In 2006 I rescued a feral kitten G and Dr Seto has been her vet since the first. He has been the vet to whom I have brought rescues and cats in need. He is always responsive. He is always attentive. He takes the time to explain what is needed. He is an excellent surgeon having performed neutering on several rescues, and dental surgery on my cats. He is a delight! Funny, smart and easy-going. The clinic is beautiful and new and a calming environment. The very best!!!"

Every since we moved to Oakville about a year ago, my husband and I are always on the look out for the best croissant and best french bakery in town. Their croissant is the best in Oakville; it totally meets our expectation. It is crispy from the outside and soft buttery from the inside. I haven't tried their cakes or savoury dishes from the menu so I can't comment on them yet."

Thanks!

Instead they ask you to leave a message and say they will get back to you by the end of the day. They never do. I switched to BMO as a result. Unfortunately, my mortgage is still there but I will transfer it out when it comes up for renewal."
tzGusd4THf5BfRhH76be7A,x3Z6mJPgtnF5ni1engieDQ,"Yellowlite installed a 5 KWH system on my roof a couple years ago.  They were polite and professional during the installation process, and they gave me a reasonable price.  However, the battery back up installation that I paid an extra $2000 for is worthless after 3 years.  It powered my house recently during a test ""outage"" for me for 20 minutes, under low power consumption.  There have been other bugs in my system which have crippled it sometimes for weeks at a time.  It is generating power, to a degree, but I think that it will take longer to earn back my initial investment in it.  If I could go back I would not do the battery back up system.  Better to just get a generator."

Had the tint and groom done along with a couple other waxing services and couldn't be happier!  If you have not experienced her gentle touch and artistic eye you owe it to yourself!! She was highly recommended by a friend of mine and I'm so grateful to have found her.

Love the studio, her suite is relaxing and super clean..she's got awesome equipment and is well prepared for whatever you might need.  One thing though, I was not sure where to park but knowing you can pull in near the apartments and park there was a big help.  

Waunakee is stepping it up with Buttercup!! Thanks Kylene xoxo -Christin N."
HBlOdLexXY9ukS9SqMsH5g,qihIX43VKn3AysLPbkTTFA,"I love this Dr office. The location is very convenient. They've always been very nice. The wait times though! I haven't experienced wait times like these since I had my first child. The old put you in a room and 'the dr will be right with you...' These days time is important, and there aren't enough hours in the day. I feel like a scheduled appt should be on schedule. Not waiting 45 minutes for the Dr."
pHQHFMBOPFtJwSEPrgvpYQ,cNO1dzhMF72PJvbt-ELntg,"If you choose to eat here. Check your order before you leave. Over charged me the last 3 times i was here. Word of advice to the owner and employees here, know what a kids quesadilla means or a mini az burrito. They put the spicy red sauce in the kids quesadilla everytime, all dark meat too. Rolled tacos weren't even served in the normal container i had to ask for one. 1 out of 5 items i ordered were actually correct. Which is why i think a one star is sufficient. I will happily raise my rating if my next experience is better than this one. Will give them one last shot. I will gladly drive the extra mile for the next location if they strike out again."
5rVehHTJLGy-RbCh9_CPhA,dJvGeG5uaCSITeDPAsD6wQ,"I use the Bingham Store just east of Deer Valley Airport...

I had my Kubota tractor serviced there, taking care of a few warranty items, and Cletus the service manager had my tractor washed and detailed before returning it to me! Great technicians and GREAT service! They work on all types of equipment...

I have taken my tractor in to Bingham for the last four years and their service has always been excellent."
3dkR_FueX-cUPGJBcGwWTQ,SpVO7hL7hbNtKcRUJ1wV9w,"I had the opportunity to work with Stuart in the production room at our church and really liked his camera work and shot selection. After seeing him work there, I jumped at the chance to be in a short film that he was making. His direction was clear and concise, and he really did a great job with lighting, framing and editing to make a high-quality product. What impressed me most was his level of professionalism on the set. It was the first time I had been on camera in more than ten years, so I was a bit nervous. Stuart realized this, and he made it a point help me through that by making sure I understood what was expected of me, answering all of my questions with patience, and even asking for my input at times! He was so fun easy to work with that the shoot flew by and I wanted to do another soon after. I was happy to find out that he had started his own company to do both video production and social media marketing because, as a small business owner, these are both areas where I need help, and having someone I know I can work with and can trust for these things is huge."

And then SHE SOLD IT! For the price we wanted! All I can say is if you are looking to sell or buy a home this is the group you want to talk to. Very aggressive program that got us the results we needed. The open houses she puts on are great! Ya have to see the signs! She was available to us any time we had a question. (sorry about the weekend and late night calls James) The office staff was also on top of everything.  Just a great group all around. Jillian, I promise if anyone I know wants to buy or sell a home I will send them your way! Thank you so much guys!

FWkRdwpOV8gW3Z84q8HvBw,32fRc4MMk1uk2JEEM7OmtQ,Wow. Had such high hopes.  Dress code? Nonexistent. This place could've taken high road and been great...however it seems they've decided to be the landing spot of misfit Scottsdale rejects.  I'm wondering the deal here as cops walked into bar and looked all around...

I called at least 5 different YMCA in Ashtabula area, and finally called here and was happy to hear that they have not only Sauna but Jacuzzi as well. 

Very friendly front desk people. We spent a great day here. Played squash, basketball, did some cardio, and of course, relaxed in the swimming pool. 

If I don't live so far away, I would come here on a weekly basis. 

I would definitely recommend this place if you would like to spend fun, active and at the same time relaxing day!"

-OoNNSSM_oE1wPcNwMyehQ,3FXEnTNKCAXz04fIel1Opw,"Princess Margaret Hospital did a lot for my father when he became ill. At first, we had a doctor we weren't too happy with that didn't help my father. He was very apathetic towards us. He eventually told us to our face ""I don't know what to do anymore"". It made our hearts sink. He ended up leaving the hospital and we were redirected to Dr. Butler.
Dr. Butler was such a kind hearted individual and showed so much respect and dedication to each patient. Just visiting him and speaking to him made my dad feel 100x better. 
In terms of wait time, we did wait a long time wherever we went. If our appointments were scheduled for 3:45 we wouldn't be seen until 5:45. We'd have to be there two hours earlier to get blood work done too so from 1-5:45 we'd be waiting around. 
They have volunteers that go around a few times daily giving out free snacks and juices for the patients and families. They are always smiling and bring with them a positive feeling throughout the hospital. There's also a Tim Hortons located on the first floor near the back exit, as well as a Druxys located beside the main exit.
It was a positive that the hospital did have free wifi, and tvs in every waiting room. The nurses at the reception desk were incredibly helpful and would do there hardest to make sure you were well taken care of. One of our nurses even came over to visit my father when he was hospitalized across the street at Toronto General just to see how he was, not because of medical forms or stuff like that. It shows day in and day out how compassionate and understanding they are.
The hospital works quick to setup MRIs, CT Scans, ultrasounds, blood work, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and many more appointments.
Overall we were extremely satisfied with our experience here. I can definitely say this hospital prolonged my fathers life for 3 years and I'm very thankful for all they do!"

UvKoGBUCrzI1TmAIVu9VYw,cENHsJjcbIx1nLb5QKcbQw,I used to love ghost armor. They definitely saved my phone a time or two but they changed their warranty policy. I think if I was grandfathered in they should honor the policy that was in place when I purchased the materials. The ONLY reason I was willing to spend so much on a whole set was because when I purchased it I knew if anything went wrong with it or I upgraded my phone I would be able to get a new protector.

After the full mouth check up and xray, we found out that i have a cavity underneath my crown from childhood. At first I was hesitant because I do not feel any pain and it is a bit costly. Dr. Ben answered every questions I had and has been very accommodating and easy to work with. He got convenient hours and didn't wait to long for my appointment. And I had to say that the results of my treatment was amazing! My crown looks like a real tooth! The color, texture and the bite was prefect! I was relieved and thankful for Dr. Ben and her nice assistant Jayvi. When it comes to the expense, Gisela (receptionist) was kind enough to discuss my options with regards to the payment.

Moreover, Dawson Dental also created a relaxing ambience prior to any procedure being performed at that moment. A++ to Dr. Ben and his team! I would highly recommend him and his dental office!"
D2ocEEccAbRXz83dU6df8A,RhqqyzgfEOqYGljGyp8f2w,"Am looking to switch to a green courier service and got a delivery from a client who uses these guys. Tried to check their website - it was down for days. Called in -- got the runaround big time.

Clearly told all three people to whom my call got bounced that I was very interested in possibly using their service but was not able to get them to give me any info (service area, basic rates, etc. - anything, really)  without giving them my banking information, which I was not going to do for someone with whom I have no business relationship. 

Was asked if I had enough business to keep them busy & was told outright that if I did not then, they had no interest in working with me.

Very rude and they made it almost impossible to even inquire about their services, much less to set up an account and use them for anything.

Going to find another green and/or socially responsible courier instead. Not at all  impressed!"
h7j6MJegP80-mCKamFWVng,urGlEIme6HVYu5eWxvt0Yw,"This was the worst experience. First off the driver calls me and repeatedly told me to make sure to have everyone ready at 9:30 pm if not he's leaving because he has a tight schedule. Which I understand but he doesn't have to be so demanding and rude he then tells me the amount I owe him and that he will calculate the gratuity that I need to owe him. I already told him I have that all organized and he then said let me do it for you anyways I then told him the amount and he then went quiet all of this took place the day before. Then when the driver arrives he comes into my house asked for the money and we said we'll pay him half now half later he said no. He's been doing this for 12 years he gets the money all now. We then read the contract and gave him everything plus tip before the ride.  While he the trip was going on in the bus he was driving aggressively and dangerous. He dropped us off and again repeatedly told us to be ready for 2am. 1:50am comes now and I'm not even in the party bus yet, he told my brother and a few others that were on the bus that he's going to leave everyone else here. It's not even 2am yet!!!!! My friend and myself were then walking to the bus and he said he was going to leave with out me! The person who paid him he was going to leave without!!!! This was still all before 2am. The driver then made us freeze our asses off and did not turn on the heat even when we asked him to turn it on bc we were freezing. Half of us were in dresses it still didn't phase him. He then drops us off and rushes us off. I did not appreciate the service he provided if I didn't have to give the money before the trip I would not be tipping him. His name was Tadesse. 

I dont recommend this limo company to anyone!!!!!"
jlayFOu6c6vEiQ2aQPwE8w,JG7mlxHRcqE3knIBWMUQWw,"I purchased a groupon for this boot camp and the expiration date for my groupon was 12/24/16.  When I arrived on 11/23/16 for the scheduled boot camp class, I was told they were no longer taking groupons.  When I showed the employee my groupon with an expiration date that clearly had not passed, he told me too bad and that they stopped taking groupons earlier in November.  He said he would not honor the expiration date because he didn't make the groupon and ""this is a business, and this is how it works."" He also found it important the mention that only one other person had come here with the groupon. This is just bad business.  Here I am, looking to try out a new place that I may decide to buy a membership and continue using and I am treated like I'm nonexistent because I have a groupon deal that someone in this company created for people like me to try the place out.  Very disgusted.  Would not recommend based on the treatment of a new customer.  I will say the other attendees of the class made me feel very welcome and they were a kind group of people (the reason I give it one extra star), but it did not cancel out the fact that I was met with the most unwelcoming response ever from the instructor/employee, who did not even make an attempt to honor my groupon or even listen to me."

First, she is excellent with communication and got back with me right away--even taking the time to call when another client had cancelled to see if my time slot was still the best for me. During the appointment she was incredibly professional and very sweet, she made me feel like I had known her for years and had some nice tips to share. The room was super relaxing and she gave wonderful massages in addition to the European Facial I received. She has a gentle touch and while I was worried initially that my skin would be red, it looked flawless and not a touch of redness was to be found. I can't say enough nice things about her and I will be booking many more follow ups before the wedding day rolls around. Five stars and more!"

I was there on one of their grand opening days, made purchases, took lots of pictures and even wrote a stellar review... and then my computer shut down and I lost my review. BOO!

That being said, here is the quick and dirty all about this new health food, supplement and nutrition store that's making waves in Richmond Hill.

 - A one stop shop for all your nutritional supplement needs, protein powders, creatine, fat burners, multi-vitamins, HGH, glutamine, BCAA's, pre-workout, post work out, etc, etc. X-factor: They have a large selection of Vegan protein/supplements for those looking for a cleaner more ethical/green method of getting fit

 - Vitamins, aisles and aisles of vitamins and nutritional supplements for all ages. Every letter of the alphabet from B12 - Zinc

 - Organic, Gluten Free, etc. Dry goods, juices, and milks of every variety for every person. If you're looking for something for a certain dietary restriction. This is the place!

The only thing I didn't see while I was here was meats and veggies, but for everything else this is the place to be. Definitely start your 2014 off right by stocking up here!"
uWUGJVpsACeHqtiigWC26g,721qpisxAYvzkLy0nuKPuw,"I've tried both chiropractors there and have been going there on and off for about 6 years. My only fault with them is that they want you in and out of there as quickly as possible. You're typically suppose to get 15 minutes and they'd fix your problems. HOWEVER, whenever I (or any of the other 3 people I know who go there) went I got 5 minutes and it would be ""okay tell me what's wrong with you"" and of that list he would pick three things. So he might crack your neck, your back, and then realign your hips or whatever it may be. And that's it, see you two weeks from now. So if you want to get your money's worth don't go here, but if you just need a quick fix then they're pretty decent for what they do."

Went to have my own used tire swapped because my original tire (with tons of tread left) was totally flat. I had been told, after only brief inspections from two other ""reputable"" places that it was impossible to patch and I was better off replacing it. Used Tires Express could have charged me a good 10 dollars more for the swap, but instead the mechanics (technicians?) had a feeling that it indeed could be patched. They showed genuine compassion (I'm a poor college kid) and said they would see what they could do for me considering the flat was nearly a new tire. They worked for the good part of an hour on cleaning the tire (I had used fix a flat which made it hard to patch/plug) and finally managed to seal it and deem it safe for road use. They then mounted and balanced it and still only charged me the $7.73 with tax the patch would have cost. Unfortunately the place I got the tire from was unable to refund my money, but I will be sure to consult this place first from now on. Would highly recommend."

4R0WQc3tLJfCcG7_e24vaA,369dtICC-UGLHcab3TPiVg,"After living with moderate back and neck pain and doing ""quick fix"" type treatments (meds / heat pads / etc) for about a year, I decided to give chiropractic a try. 

Anyway... I can't say enough good stuff about the doc here. He will listen to you and come up with a treatment plan that makes sense. I think some people will be nervous their first time, but he is very good about telling you what he's about to do and asking how you're feeling through the various adjustments. 

My results are probably not typical but the combination of stretches, massage and adjustments relieved about 85% of my pain after the first week. After a few months of adjustments and regular massage, my back (and my legs / shoulders) are feeling better than they have in years. Individual results may vary, boys and girls but TRUST ME: if you're having back, shoulder, and/or neck pain. Don't wait.. call this place. 

Oh.. massage: Carla is the massage therapist that I see and she is excellent for deep tissue and sports massage. She's also a certified trainer so understands the stresses and strains that come with regular workouts, as well as how to fix them.  She does lymph-node-stimulation type massage and other types as well, but I can only attest to the great results I've had from her deep tissue and sports stuff. 

Ok - I'm re-reading this review and I'm thinking it sounds like a cheesy local car commerical but.. well, I have no excuses. I'm a fanboy of this place, I guess. 

Seriously - life is to short to live with back pain that limits what you can do and how much you can enjoy your life. Go get it fixed. If you're having twinges and somewhat regular pain there is probably more to fix there than you realize."

They encouraged us to try on several of the garments that we were falling in love with and even took our photos! Actually, they were very excited with just how much we loved taking photos. (These two REALLY understand customer service and how important photography and social media are to the 30-something set) We had a lovely dialogue about how vintage fashion is one of the most delightful interests one could have because it tells so many stories! They offered to watch my friend's dog as we perused the amazing goodies, and even gave us cookies while we were trying on outfits.

I got an overall color and a haircut and styling for $90.

I asked the girl if she could add peppers and onions on the salad as it only comes with walnuts and blue cheese. She stated that it doesn't come with that and it comes with blue cheese and walnuts. I was like hmm OK can I add it? And she told me again they usually don't do that. I was like look I can pay for it and she was like OK don't worry about it but we don't usually do this.  Like I'm asking for a free steak or something.. So I thought that was slightly rude..my cup of soup is about enough to feed my toddler for 4$ that's pretty sad..  My salad is pretty good. I wouldn't pay 11 dollars again for it with such limited ingredients. The chicken is almost always dry everytime I've ever visited.. I was given 2 dressings with my salad both supposed to be balsamic vinegrete I'm assuming. However one is dark like molasses and one was more light brown. Ughh I'm too hungry and in a rush to go back. Here's to hoping I don't get sick. I'm also a mall employee and I remember the last time I came I asked the manager or owner, possibly, if they do mall discount and he treated me like I was a crazy woman and basically told me that it's ridiculous to even ask him such a thing seeing as his prices are way cheaper then they should be compared to his west gate location.. And that I should be happy with what I got.. Side note: this place is the most overpriced and underwhelming food spot in the entire food court.. Save your money and get a salad from chipotle!! I know I will next time.."

I've been looking for a particular type of sweater FOREVER and Jacob just seemed like the place to get it. Lucky for me, I happened to come across a group of 3 fantastic saleswomen who were working at this 'duo-store.' 

One of the girls actually tried on the sweater for me, because I was wearing a dress. She took the time to put all her stuff down and try the sweater on so that I could see what it would look like on. I thought that was super sweet considering the store was pretty busy, but she was adamant about helping me find exactly what I was looking for. 

Sure enough, I ended up leaving with exactly what I had envisioned.

I love cheese fries. I don't know WHAT the cheese is made out of and quite frankly, I don't want to know, but I DO know that no one makes 'em quite like Taco Bell.

Imagine my disappointment when me and a bunch of girlfriends took a trip across the border for a shopping spree and sat down at the local American Taco Bell and found out they DO NOT serve cheese fries at Taco Bells in the United States. I'm sorry.... SAY WHAAAAT?!?!?!?

So Canadian Taco Bells are where it's at. Dreamy combo? Seven Layer Burrito, cheese fries, medium diet Dr. Pepper (don't ask why I bother with the 'diet' at this point) and extra extra EXTRA hot sauce packages on the side. WICKED.

If you've never discovered all that is Taco Bell, I highly recommend it as a satisfying, tex-mex type of fast-food experience. It's tasty...not necessarily healthy...but TASTY."

CLEANLINESS
My friend and I spent a girls day getting some gel manis at the newly opened Ten Spot in Port Credit. First thing I'd like to point out - this place is incredibly clean. I'm a bit of a clean freak and some nail salons don't sanitize that well which freaks me out... The Ten Spot uses sterilized tools and new buffers for every manicure! While I was getting my mani done I watched the girls clean the pedi stations and prepare waxing rooms - I was so impressed!! 

CUSTOMER SERVICE
The customer service experience was incredible. I was running 15 minutes late for my appointment and they happily accommodated me, everyone was super chill and I just got majorly good vibes from the place. Our estheticians were such lovely ladies to talk to - it was like chatting with friends. 

GEL MANIS
My friend and I got gel manicures done. Gloria (my esthetician) took the time to buff and shape my nails and make sure everything was buffed and moisturized. They have a wide rack of colors (gel and non gel) to choose from. Our gel manis came with hand and arm massages at the end - so relaxing!

TIPS
- Unfortunately The Ten Spot doesn't do gel nail extensions, I think they only do manicures on natural nails? 
- I asked what the most popular services were and they said Brazilian waxes and gel manicures. I've never had a ""Brazilly"" before but I'd trust them because this place is so damn clean! 
- Ask for Susana or Gloria Rose, they were super friendly and did a great job on our manicures! 
- Although their services are a bit on the pricier side, totally worth it for the level of service, cleanliness, and final result.
- Treat yo mama (or yourself) to something here, she'll thank you for it.

tldr; clean, great service, a bit pricy, my new fave nail place and I hope to come back again soon!"

After using them for 8 years, we realized we were being over-charged, so we decided to switch to another firm. We called TD Merchant Services and asked for our account to be cancelled. Since this date, our bank account has continued to be charged without our authorization.  It was at this time that we were told that the 8 year old terminal would not need to be returned since it was obsolete. We were also informed that there was a $300 cancellation fee if we cancelled immediately. We opted to cancel. In early May, when we noticed more charges being withdrawn from our checking account, we again called to cancel our services, at which time we were told that an $880 fee would apply due to not returning the terminal, and they refused to stop charging us until I agreed to the fee.  On May 31st, on a recorded call, I spoke with ""Eddy,"" who again informed us that he could not cancel the account without my acceptance of the fee. Eddy also revealed personal information such as my recently changed address, and phone numbers, which I had not authorized to be shared between TD Canada Trust (my Bank) and TD Merchant services.

I ""made"" a necklace but I use the word ""made"" loosely as the owner had to do the majority of the work.  The necklace came to about $70 which I felt was very pricey.  Was it a cute thing to do on a Sunday afternoon?  Yes...but I doubt I'll be back."

We ultimately selected them because the thoroughness of their proposal and professional communication gave us a higher level of confidence that the job would be done right.  We had a fairly extensive remodel that required repairing some unforeseen structural problems from original builder.  Jeff at BHB always clearly communicated challenges and mitigation options.  Jeff and Mike have a high level of attention to detail and the pride they take in their work is obvious.  They personally oversaw that each subcontractor did the job correctly.    Questions were always answered thoroughly, calls returned promptly, and scheduled appts were always met.  We would definitely use them again, and would highly recommend them to anyone seeking a GC that wants assurance of things being doing right.."

Rjnm0LazQQKok5H_-R4rDQ,UWVJNu1j3KeUbVHg987HTA,This place blows my mind. I have never in my life witnessed people eff up a damn bagel time and time again. It so lame cause i can walk there and it wld be stupid to go anywhere else. They consistantly get orders wrong. If i say jalapeГ±o spread i get reg. Cream cheese. And when i say cream cheese i mean they put it on one side then smash the bagel 2gether. So one side is always practically dry. I have had to walk back multiple timea and just be like can i actually have some cream cheese on my bagel!! Not only do they get the lind of spread wrong all the time but then u barely get ne cheese on their fuck up! Save your time and money. This place is a joke. YOU HAD ONE JOB!!!!

I'm very cautious because there seems to be a lot of break-ins into the apartments and cars but we haven't ran into any trouble with that (hopefully not ever but still cautious). The office people are friendly and every time a put in a request for something broken or needing of the bug spray guy to come by they fill it.

When I booked them, I clarified that they would provide blankets and protection for our furniture. It seems that they did not. As we settled into our new home, we found numerous items that were damaged. Our shoe shelf was bent out of shape and has lost a foot. The computer desk has a scrap on the top that has removed the veneer finish. Our headboard for our bed was scrapped all along the top. Our bookshelf has a scrap along the side. A lamp has the shade cracked. The foot to a desk disappeared. And, the worst of it all, a cedar, hand made chest that was given to me 20 years ago, has a deep gouge on it. It seems that something must have fallen on it or something. 

I imagine if you were simply moving boxes, these guys would be ok (although they were an hour later than the agreed upon time) but if you have anything you care about, try someone else."

It did not turn on and was quite dirty; he brought it back to life! It looks and sounds beautiful! You cannot beat his prices, and the super fast repair time...1 week! He made sure to keep in touch while the machine was in his shop to let us know what it needed and how everything was going. Quick and easy drop-off and setup in our home. He was very knowledgeable about the machine's gameplay and taught us a ton on how to maintain it. He also gave us a generous warranty and informed us that if we had any questions, or required any maintenance materials, to just give him a call. Will definitely be using him for any future machine repairs and will gladly refer him to anyone!

Do NOT pay attention to the doofus who gave him a 1-star review, because that's all he seems to give any business on here."

We asked around and we decided to do the gifted testing at  Dr. Shenfield's centre. My son scored high, but not high enough to be placed in a public gifted program. We are not too far from Pace, which is a  private gifted school, so we are going to try it out. 
Dr. Tali and Mariya were very friendly and professional. We learned a lot about our son's strengths and weaknesses and got some good recommendations. Hopefully, his score will be enough for Pace..."
ChHVVJGb0Nt_kObOcvwmxg,vcjNP4bLUGqEvZqFLYiQFQ,"The Menchie's franchise is one of my go to dessert places. The concept is innovative, a self serve frozen yogurt bar where you pay by the weight and paper sample cups to try the different flavours on your own.

You've got to be careful though, frozen yogurt might be better for you than the frozen counterpart (*cough* ice cream) but the cookie dough, cheesecake bits, chocolate chips, etc... certainly add to the calories. If you're not careful a $5 dessert can quickly become a $15 meal when you get to the cashier to pay. 

This past Mother's Day, we picked up a Cookies n' Cream Delight frozen yogurt cake for my fiancГ©'s mother. The cake was made with one layer of cookies and cream yogurt and one layer of cake batter yogurt (our substitute). The base and centre was made up of chopped chocolate cookie pieces and it was topped with Oreos. It wasn't bad for a ""healthier"" alternative. 

I'll come back for the soft serve, but will probably splurge on the calories next time for the cake."

After vising the clinic, Dr. Jimmy Feng identified the issue as an IT band issue.  He did some treatment on the leg and also gave me follow-up stretches to use on a normal basis.  

To this day, I use the stretches before and after every long run.  I have now completed 4 half marathons since my treatment and before I got treated I was never able to run the distance without having to stop for pain.

I think they do a good job, although I only have pedicures, I don't have acrylic nails, or other speciality services, so I can't comment on that.  They do a thorough job on pedicures though.  
My concern is related to their waxing service.  I have gone a few times for a bikini wax, and I think there are better places that provide more professional services.  My issue is that yesterday after having a bikini wax, I was quite sore, and in fact the skin was raw in one area.  Although not bleeding, it was darn close.  I came home and there was wax all over my underwear, where they didn't get it off of me.  I would rate their waxing service as very poor quality.  So, use this place for nails, but DO NOT USE IT for waxing services.  I think they pose a health risk."

The setup is nice and clean and the items are thoughtfully organised. The staff was there for help when needed which is appreciated. 
The variety of items sold here is decent for linens (surprise surprise), OK for kitchen tools and cook-ware.
I was looking for a specific item and the variety they had here was quite nice. Ended up getting something that is sure to wow the recipient.  They also advertise a 1 year price match warranty which is unheard of in retail as far as I know. 
The prices were decent for the kind of items they offer.

A scruffy, overworked looking gentleman opened the door and I got a peek in.  It looked like a typical bar only it was completely empty.  Assuming they were in need of patrons to order drinks I asked if I could come inside.  He said ""members only"".  To which I replied, ""can I apply for a membership?"" which is typical for North Carolina nightclubs with a three day membership rule.  He responded again ""members only, you have to know someone"".  

Determined to find out once and for all what their deal was, I asked if it was a bar.  Already looking annoyed he stammered ""yes, it's a bar"" and offered no further information.  I became confused, so coming from Chicago, where anything can happen, I asked ""is it a gay bar?""  At which point he practically shouted ""NO, IT""S JUST A BAR!""  So I said ""hey no offense I was just trying to figure your place out"" and he quickly closed the door to, I assume, continue running his ""business"".

I'm not sure what they do in there, but they don't seem to care much about running a ""bar"".  This place is just spooky..."

I also heard the musicians order some food and drinks and they were charged for it! I felt bad because I didn't have to pay the musicians to play for me but they had to pay for their food?!

The sofa, an iconic piece, dating back to the '70's, was purchased in flawless condition and in my wanting to preserve its condition, I entrusted Craters & Freighters with the delicate task of transporting this artifact from North Carolina to NYC with White Glove specification.

Loren Chavis-Waldrop, the manager at Craters & Freighters, was a consummate professional.  Loren handled my transport with painstakingly appreciated detail - corresponding mostly by way of email, Loren mapped out and expertly managed everything that would take place, how and when it would take place - charting by way of photograph all major stops: the retrieval process and as well the sofa being carefully packed in its custom wooden crate, the sofa itself wrapped in layers and layers of bubble wrap, sitting on foam to prevent from shock during transport and as well to protect the base of the sofa during travel.  

I recommend Craters & Freighters to all in need of a qualitative shipping company with the expertise needed to transport the most valuable of pieces!"

I asked for the bacon to be burned and unlike some other places which  are unwilling to comply, they burned it! Because of the heat, I was glad to see they weren't trying to go for a gigantic thick and heavy omelette. The egg and cheese on an English muffin was just that.

I am on a serious hunt for a sparkly top for the holiday season. Jacflash had a lot of options.. all of which seemed to have an excessive price tag attached. Then one of the girls mentioned the sale room in the back which peaked my interest.

Upon entering one of my girlfriends found shoes the were awesome but unfortunately a size too big and in the same section, I found a fancy hair piece which would be the perfect accessory for the holidays. I was so happy to have found it... and on sale! ($20 when normally $45 and no tax!)

Well, I took it to check out and a girl who seemed to still be learning the system asked for help. When I mentioned that I found it in the sale section, the more experienced woman working there, all but accused me of lying. I was a bit baffled because I was so happy with my find that I couldn't believe I was being accused of marking down the price for my benefit. Luckily another co-worker was able to (after a few minutes of accusing glances) come to my rescue and confirm the sale. If the new girl hadn't already put my card thru at the reduced rate, I would have just left. 

Besides that hiccup, the store is very well decorated (I love the lighting fixture over the cash) and they do have great pieces there. You just need to be prepared to spend a few dollars. (and perhaps take a lie detector test)"

I had the Thursday lunch special: half a chicken wrap, soup, and salad for $8.  

I noticed the wrap was pre-wrapped!  The only thing they did was throw it on the grill to create the grill marks.  Not impressed.  It can't possibly tack on that much additional time to assemble and then roll a tortilla, can it?!  Decent amount of chicken and fillings.  The best part was they included their special sauce to dip the wrap into.  

The soup was pre-packaged and was pretty salty.  It was a tiny little cup.  Two packs of crackers came with the soup.

The salad was made up of iceberg lettuce, some shredded carrots and purple cabbage, some sliced celery, cucumber, and a tomato wedge.  All the veg seemed dry on the ends.  You choose the dressing.

It was just alright.  It seemed like a healthier choice.  There are so many other options here though."

Fortunately, I went to another endodontist for a second opinion before extracting my tooth and he showed me on the x-ray the problems with the root canal job Dr. Pulver had done.  My new endodontist redid the root canal and I haven't had any problems since. Dr. Pulver should have his license revoked."

Carrier: Global Crossing Local Services
Phone type: Landline
ADDRESS
Seattle WA 98115
Decided to call the number back to f**k with a possible scammer and waste their time to prevent them from scamming a naive person, at least for just a few minutes.  The recorded message said something about my Amazon Prime account.  I came to the realization that the time of the call and the time of my Amazon package delivery lined up.  So it's possible that some scammer companies may use this service, but Amazon does as well.  Good to know that Amazon isn't just handing my number out to all of the random delivery drivers that bring me my goodies every week; they use Global Crossing."

She received the flowers, some were wilted and brown, while the leaves that were in the bouquet were broken, dry and snapped. I had just phoned the business to ask for some sort of compensation but they were not willing to own up to their faults, blaming the weather and their driver (who is employed by them). I had spent 80$ for the deluxe version to find out that my friend was sent the standard (which was worth 45$) I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone, service is crap and what you pay for is ridiculous."

6EbUsMCc-lJxFzf2fw0EMw,Q6dqta96AMN6SonURAdLUA,"After researching several other companies online through Google, Yelp and Angie's List and reading all of the bad reviews on local companies in my area, I came across Zen Windows. Other companies require a sales person to come to your home but not Zen Windows. I was a little skeptical at first because I wondered how they could give me an accurate price quote without seeing my home but they had set prices per window for the style we wanted. I requested a quote online and was contacted by Andrew. We had a brief 5 minute conversation over the phone so he could get an idea of what we wanted, including how many windows needed,  and had a quote sent to me shortly after. There was no pressure, no pushy sales tactics,  no hassle. Andrew advised me to just let him know if we'd like to proceed after reviewing the quote. We needed 18 windows installed and he gave us a very fair, reasonable price. Our windows were ready within a few weeks and installation was set for shortly after. The installation team (3 guys) arrived on time and started working right away. I was originally told it would probably take 2 days to install all of our windows but they had them all done in 7 hours!! They never even stopped to take a break. We were really impressed. They were friendly, funny and talked to us all afternoon. It made having strangers in our home a lot more comfortable. Before leaving, they showed us how to operate the windows. I love the fact that our windows can be flipped down and cleaned from inside since we have a 2 story home. I definitely recommend Zen Windows Pittsburgh to anyone and everyone looking for quality windows at a reasonable price. After our exceptional service, I wouldn't go anywhere else! Thanks Zen Windows!!"

I bought a laser deal from teambuy (or dealfind) which was supposed to be unlimited one hour treatment for unlimited body parts for one year!!!!! when I went there the first session they told me they could only cover my full legs in one hour and whatever I get in the first session is what I get in the next sessions. I said ok and went ahead with the treatment. The lady worked so slow that day to convince me that was all they could do in an hour. Next session when I went there they did the same treatment in 10 minutes!!!!!!  and that is still not the worse part. I have had so many laser treatments so far and when you tell them that it hurts they decrease the degree to make it less painful for you ! but this lady sets the devise on a high degree for me to make it as painful as she could and when I ask her to decrease it she says "" this is the lowest""! dauhhhhh this is impossible to get such a pain in the lowest degree. and she did this for 3 sessions so that I had to quit the treatment after a while. I am sure she did this on purpose. 

Please do yourself a favor and don't go there! they are rude and ignorant with horrible service. Believe me I just became a yelp member to write this review and let people know that this place is SCAM!!!!!!!!!!"

You know this isn't Ikea as soon as you walk in.  The furniture is of a different caliber completely and fascinating.  The colors you can get are endless.  There is no boundaries here for possibilities.  You will have just as much fun imagining the color schemes as you would actually buying them.  The staff there also have talents in interior design and can help you coordinate and measure if necessary.  My 7 seater sofa is a custom made EQ3 masterpiece.  It is so comfortable I have yet to see one friend sleep over and not pass out completely.  Takes the best of design and comfort and wraps it into one sofa.  We chose a nice soft neutral gray color and it goes with everything, especially purple and royal blue accents.  Highly recommend!  One of my favorite furniture stores in Calgary."
8oJGvieNjG6JGhRD4iIu5A,LHCOcErlvbOqpM9x4YdzMw,"I bought an online deal which was something like 10 classes for $10 or so. For the deal it was definitely worth it.

Location: right at Yonge and Bloor, there is no way you'll find parking. It's not that obvious to find, it's a narrow building that goes up 3 floors.

Facilities: the reception is professional with finger print recognition. The change rooms have lockers and showers. You go up the stairs for the boxing gym which is a wide space and a boxing ring at the far end. 

The class: I took regular boxing classes and one muay Thai class. The boxing classes were challenging and the instructors, though not always friendly, would come round and correct your stance and help you improve. Especially if you tell them that you are new to boxing, they'll focus more attention on you."

This is really my 2nd post and I will only post based on serious issues found in the restaurant service industry. To the point, Kitchen claimed (on the menu) that an item, namely the mushroom soup contains NO meat or poultry based products and IT ACTUALLY DOES.  It was written that the mushroom soup was a vegetable base. Only after my mother-in-law questioned it, the server told us it was actually a chicken stock base. I would have never thought to ask but bless my mother-in-law, she has to check everything based on religious dietary requirements and I happen to be pescetarian, When the server revealed the truth only after we inquired, his response was ""yes, point noted, I guess we should change that."", with a really bad attitude as well.

Msa288irSAKdZFSROH-Q4w,_zPT9ZmR5-nUfsprzIiRew,"I read a bunch of reviews before I bought a voucher to try their food. All of the reviews were pretty good, more positive than negative, so I thought I'd give it a try. 

Them menu isn't huge, but the voucher I had was for $90 worth of food, so that was plenty for my cousin and myself. The server was great, she'd seen these vouchers before and gave us a pretty good idea at what we could get. 

We started with Baked Brie; it came with baked pita, peach marmalade and a garlic parmesan loaf. It was warm and delicious. The pita was great and we polished it off quick. The garlic loaf was also good, but we didn't want to fill up on bread. I wanted to get some seafood items that I saw great reviews for, but my cousin isn't a fan and I didn't want eat it all myself or waste it.

For our mains, she chose the Chicken Caesar Wrap and I had the Stuffed Chicken. She liked the wrap, said it wasn't special, but good none-the-less. My Stuffed Chicken was another story. For starters, it looked like a mess. Presentation was terrible. It was 'stuffed' with mushrooms, brie, asparagus and other stuff that I didn't notice because the chicken was so fatty that I couldn't eat it. I struggled to find an actual piece of chicken. It wasn't stuffed, it was unrolled and a mess. The roasted red pepper sauce was flavourless, the pasta was filler and the veggies were freezer burnt. Luckily, I ended up eating too much bread from the appetizer that I wasn't really hungry anyway.

Since we had $90 to burn, why not get dessert? She got the Banana Flambe and I got the Gelato. Both were enjoyable; a much needed boost. 

The service was good and the place was very clean. Sadly, we didn't use the whole $90. I would've like to see if something else would've redeemed this place for the Not Stuffed 'Chicken', but it didn't happen. I was so sad; the reviews were so good! 

I don't think I'll be going back."
DZvVyvav740Tpwi5xQoNeQ,_zPT9ZmR5-nUfsprzIiRew,"My friend and I had a hankering for pub food. Where to go? Looking for a new place to try, we came to Pearson Pub. This place has plenty of seating and a very large bar with TVs all over. They have daily food specials, live music and karaoke. It had your typical pub vibe, dark wooden furniture and walls, worn carpet, regulars perched at the bar; the usual. It was a lot bigger than I expected.(That's what she said, ya ya) 

I went with the Fish & Chips and my friend got Wings with Sweet Chili sauce. The fish and chips came with 2 decent pieces of Haddock, coleslaw, tartar sauce and fries. There was a little more batter than I like, but it was still good. The coleslaw and fries were perfect; plentiful and crunchy! She said the wings were good, a little kick, but not much. To me, it would've been hot as she is a spicy gal! 

It wasn't until we were done eating that we noticed people coming back to the table with bowls of something. Turns out, there's complimentary soup in the corner by the fireplace, so keep an eye out for it when you're there. 

Service was ok. We waited 15min or so before we were served. A little pet peeve of mine is when tables seated after me get served first. The drink menu is all of the usual suspects, but sadly no craft beer. Everything there was extremely OK - not better, not worse, just really OK."

She had an emergency so the massage was delayed while she took care of it which is no problem but in the end I was shorted approximately 15 minutes which they very graciously applied to the second massage.  The second one who is there only on Tuesdays and Thursdays, ran a little late (again no problem as long as I get my full time). After setting up the room she came out to get me eating food which I thought was VERY unprofessional.  Even the guy before me noticed and said ""are you eating?""  Her massage was not horrible but I've had much better but she talked quite a bit.  At one point I could tell she was eating while talking and was massaging me with one hand.  I later noticed a tupperware container on a table near my head.  I immediately went home and showered.

I was told that they had run out of the syrup that they used to make the lemonade, and that the ovens were off because they were closing soon (it was about 45 mins before closing) so they couldn't warm up my cookie. Another time I ordered a latte and a warmed up chocolate chip cookie again. After paying, they told me that they had run out of those square parchment paper things that they put the cookie on and therefore they couldn't warm up my cookie. I asked for them to credit back my Starbucks card for the cost of the cookie. They tried to get me to get another pastry. I declined. Then, like some sort of divine miracle, someone went downstairs and found a brand new box of parchment paper squares. Lame! So to summarize, I avoid this location whenever I want a warm cookie."

uSwUckl3l5u8T6Auu3Cgug,BOhVTi_FJWrdCx0HDxfamA,"I almost feel bad writing this review because the girl who did my hair was very nice BUT after having a night to digest the horrible highlights/lowlights, I need to write a review. 

I had a day to occupy my time while my husband was at a conference. I thought getting my hair color boosted with very subtle highlights and lowlights would be a great use of my time. 

I had an early morning appointment and come prepared with 3 pictures of what I wanted and a picture showing what I didn't want. My hair was pretty light to begin with; definitely no need for harsh bleach would be needed to accomplish what I was asking for. 

I ended up with overly bleached chunky highlights and chunky BLACK lowlights. That is far from my request of subtle highlights/lowlights. My hair is fried and looks like a nonprofessional did my hair. She applied a ""toner"" to some of the hair in the front but not the side or the back. It's ridiculous how badly my hair looks! 

Today, I'm more upset over how fried my previously healthy hair is.

Ju7ersBvkuz0MJ0SLXeHhg,PoVHjNdPgeR6JepAdvWOkQ,"This place always makes me feel good... maybe that's just the retail therapy at work ;). 

There's just something sweet (or a few things) about this little shop: neat rows of awesomely priced clothing in great condition, friendly and supportive staff who seem to enjoy their work and each other, and a good cause that anyone can get behind. 

So far, this location is my favourite due to its good selection and organization. The brand selection is varied -- you'll find anything from forever21 to Michael Kors (more of the former, though). I love when a shop has a section dedicated to little black dresses, how chic ;). My most frequent disappointment here is that it's often hard to find small sizes in both the clothing and shoe selection. Turnover isn't quite as frequent as some other stores, so I usually let a few months go between visits.

It's also fun to browse their non-clothing section for books and small home items. For Halloween last year, we bought a whole box of new Halloween children's picture books for $1 a piece!"
y_Haa3kEddcox6R78o12pQ,5J371SHi-BsuzyOu_C840Q,"Pretty drab. I went there to check out the 50% off spring sale and was surprised there wasn't a crowd, but soon realized they were at better thrift stops. The store offers quantity but very poor quality and pricing that reveals unawareness of this. The men's section may be more promising but also more smelly. I was not inclined to linger or return. Not worth the trip to Dundas and Parliament.

The neighbourhood is being shifted by gentrification and the sprawl of Ryerson University, but it is still mostly people living on low incomes. The pricing in this store should reflect that but it doesn't. I thought the Sally Ann was more sensitive to those issues."

eFYMDuzDjFHtZulZ6qRb8A,2wlff1JIXShUQJ7_m1HXkQ,"There isn't much to say about gas stations but I'm going to give it a shot.  

I am going to say that this is a great general location.  It competes with an esso but its right off the highway.  If you are on the highway rocking to some usher and your gas light goes on, its a really long way from hurontario to the next exit.  It's also one of the places where the backlog of traffic can occur.  This makes the hurontario exit a key stopping site for those going into the city on a low tank of gas.  

However, it would have been even better if the gas station were on the west side of the road, as it is very hard to access it unless you do a U turn or can drive over curbs.

A great location generally but not specifically.

In terms of gas, it has it.  It also is brightly lit but to counter that, it doesn't accept aeroplan!"

Messy displays, similar to what you would find at low quality knockoff shoe store."
4HRf1Tag6B-v4nnIDVBZhQ,3wlZ3M-9MERAnQKEPKP0Mw,"Don't buy the hype. The shoes are not made in Canada and the quality is hit and miss.

I had a pair of $250 boots from here that lasted 7 months of occasional wear before both heel cups broke and the store wouldn't repair them despite the boots still being in ""warranty"". They were well maintained and the uppers leather was in great shape, but it didn't matter.

They preach great customer service but that only seems to hold true while you're buying another pair."

Normally the dumb bitches aren't there so you don't have to worry about it and even if there is a dumb one there you just ask for another one but this time it was all dumb bitches.

Apparently it is really improving from the first time he went a few months ago and they are heading toward a truly excellent and unique set-up. Some of the tanks are so radical I have never seen their equal in any other store.

They have the best prices in town on aquarium pumps and coral-appropriate lighting systems. The staff ranges from owner & excellent to newbie who needs to filter everything through someone else. He has gotten a couple of nice coral pieces and a new healthy blenny, so we have high hopes for the continued quality of their livestock. Unlike other stores, you MUST wear gloves when combing through their live rock. I got horrible splinters of something in my hands.

I ordered a Shamrock, a variation of the Ruben. Layered corned beef, swiss, Russian dressing on marbled rye bread. I added cole slaw. It was prepared with love. My sandwich came with a tiny Dixie cup of potato salad, sweet tea, all for $10.

They also have menus available for nearby delivery places so it's pretty simple to order in food.

It shares a restroom with Art next door, and the night I was there they were having a portrait night with a nude model, so walking through to use the restroom was a touch awkward.  Maybe check the schedule before bringing anyone who might be offended by something like that.

sirrm86qpDQeTM8JmA9mAQ,v-xZmtG32xQZdt0WkRHP-w,"this shop was extraordinarily unprofessional, rude and did NOT fulfill an order which was accepted

I ordered online and received a confirmation email that TWO flower arrangements would be delivered to the same address --- as well, the MONEY was taken from my bank account.

WITH NO WARNING TO ME, the shop apparently decided that they did not want to handle the order --- but NEVER ADVISED US!!!!

When I called to find out what had happened to the delivery, I was treated VERY POORLY.  Apparently good manners and professionalism are not a part of this business's acumen.

There was no apology, no explanation, no desire to assist in making the situation right.  My problem was that I was ordering with a California zip code (because that is where I live) and that was apparently too much for this shop to handle.

My friend, who was desperately ill, lives in the Pittsburgh area --- if I could have delivered the flowers myself I would have... but to simply cancel the order WITH NO NOTIFICATION WAS HORRID.  And, then to act as if I had done something wrong (when they had already deducted my money from my bank account) is such unprofessionalism."

IFprF9HSrseldTJoERs-vg,y1roZgEnlDpNQQzD6xt14w,"Daniel and Heather were excellent from start to finish. We contacted them and their response was quick and they came out to our home for a meet and greet with our 1 dog and 2 cats. I have been searching for a great pet sitting service since I moved to the east valley last May, and this can be a very stressful endeavor! Once Daniel and Heather came out, we clicked from the start. They are both so nice and Daniel is very organized; taking notes the whole time, and explaining everything. They have an online form to fill out, and easy online billing (or you can pay by cash/check), and they are insured. 

We were out of town a full week, all the way across the country. We scheduled Heather to stay overnight at our home with the pets, from approximately 6pm to 6am. It's always nerve-wracking leaving your animals behind and trusting that someone will show up when they say they will. However, my mind was put at ease and I was able to enjoy my vacation because Heather texted me twice a day, once when she arrived at my home, and again when she left in the morning. She sent plenty of pictures and my dog got more walks than he's used to with us! They were definitely spoiled! 

I came home to a clean home (Heather even washed all linens that she used), everything was in its place, mail was picked up, litter boxes clean and poop scooped! I was so thrilled with the communication throughout the entire process. We will absolutely be using Daniel and Heather's services again!"
PowjIhG798ql2FHP7a0Nsg,Ww9IvgIEWvLhx5BtJkDtmA,"What to do when it's date night, but you don't feel like being TOO adventurous? Why, bowling of course! It's our go-to spot when we don't want to stay in but don't feel like getting all dressed up and interacting with a bunch of people.

This isn't a close spot - normally we hit up Merivale, but the bf insisted we play ten pin so I was vetoed. McArthur Lanes is right in the heart of Vanier, off the Parkway and just off McArthur on the left. We dropped by around 10 p.m. on a Friday and the place was pretty busy, but emptied out fairly quickly (except for some sketchy drunk guys hanging out around the arcade and by the entrance).

Okay, so the good: obviously the ten pins, if that's your game. They're licensed, so pitchers are readily available. Note: some people were super sloshed by the time we got there so I'm guessing it's decently priced beer. On the more expensive side, we paid $30 for an hour of bowling, including our shoes. That seemed pretty intense to me. They've got the usual glow-in-the-dark thing going on with the black lights (eff - remind me not to wear black Yelpers - I looked like a bad Head and Shoulders ad). We didn't hit up the arcade, but they've got a small one as well.

So overall, my experience was pretty average. I'm much rather hit up Merivale, but like I said, if you're looking for ten pin this is the way to go. The staff were also really sweet and on top of things which was nice."

VHbT6RRMXMgFOOC3p2UtSg,-x1516ZG5GllZiBjDQlRkA,"Bistro Etc is a tasty little bistro in the Plateau district. It's a cute restaurant, definitely date material and perfect for a gathering of friends and family. The decor is dark wood, classic bar, and traditional. A projector screen is strategically placed by the bar. Perfect for catching up on sports games and the olympics.

For dinner I had the steak bavette. It was cooked in red wine and accompanied with frites maison and a salad. Even though my dish was supposed to come with a salad, it was plated with cooked zuchini, carrots, and bell peppers instead. My friend ordered the same thing and his came with a salad. I liked mine better though. The steak was perfect. I ordered it medium but it would definitely taste even better a little more pink. The frites were are absolutely delicious. They weren't the skinny fry type but a little thicker. They tasted like a crispy baked potato.  The bread served was fresh baked and warm. Everything was good.

We had a vegetarian with us and she didn't have any trouble finding something to eat. The waitress was very nice and explained all the dishes to us because the menu was written in French. Bistro Etc has everything from salads to burgers to pasta and steak.

When the bill came, we were each given an individual bill (something that is frowned upon in the USA) without any problems. A handy dandy credit card machine made paying speedy and effortless. 

We enjoyed our dinner so much that we returned the next morning for Sunday brunch. I was tempted to get a steak again but opted for the Avocat sandwich. It had a thin piece of chicken breast with a slab of goat cheese and avocado. It was alright. Paired with a salad the meal was not too heavy but filling enough to give me energy to start my day. Bistro Etc also has many omelettes as well as the standard bagel and cream cheese and yogurt for breakfast to choose from.

Service is a little slow at Bistro Etc but the food makes it worth it. It's relatively inexpensive and the quality is good."

I HAVE NO IDEA WHY THEY HAVE THIS LISTED UNDER MELVIN'S NOW - MAYBE TRYING TO HIDE THEIR BAD NAME? BEYOND TERRIBLE customer service. My 1st appt the owner failed to show. I called and called while waiting outside their office. NO answer. Finally a girl picks up the phone and said the owner cancelled all her appointments today for ""personal reasons"". Ever hear of a back up?! I drove all the way from Mesa to Phoenix for this appointment. Her remark was: ""I'm sorry we must not have had you on the schedule or we were missing your phone number"". Ugh so unprofessional. She said she could rebook for tomorrow. I said okay. Next day: I show up. The place is BEYOND filthy. First of all, the building resembles a shady apartment complex and I was a little afraid for my safety. I walk in. The front office is tiny. The one and only room they have for services is used for hair coloring, cutting, massages, laser tattoo removal, laser hair removal (I could go on). Omg is my first thought. My session was super fast and I knew she didn't cover the area I was having done adequately, however, I didn't comment. I figured I'd ask questions at my 2nd appt. When she left the room, I had to wipe the bottom of my feet off on the multipurpose ""bed"" (for lack of a better term due to the fact that I was unsure of everything she uses it for) of what felt and looked like hair, dirt, cat litter (you name it). I felt dirty after leaving. I was given a reminder card for my next appt (February 11th). She said she was moving to a new location March 1st and at my next appointment (Feb 11) I would be given info on where the new location would be. So, today was Feb 11th I show up and ONCE AGAIN the owner failed to show! This time the door to her office was open. I walked in to find the place COMPLETELY GUTTED of everything except her business sign she left behind. I call the number on the sign to let her know I was at her Phoenix office for my 2pm appt. I must've called her 100 times. NO ANSWER. The voicemail was full so I couldn't leave a message (I'M ASSUMING FULL OF MSGS FROM OTHER FURIOUS CUSTOMERS). The address of her new location (all the way in Scottsdale) was mentioned on the voicemail. So, I drove from Mesa to Phoenix then all the way to Scottsdale (TO NOW FIND A CLOSED OFFICE IN SCOTTSDALE)! UGH!! I RECEIVED NO PHONE CALL FOR A CANCELLATION AND NO PHONE CALL REGARDING THEIR LOCATION CHANGE!! VERY, VERY, VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. THIS WOMAN DOES NOT, I REPEAT DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS. SHE HAS EXTREME LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH HER CLIENTS AND NEVER, EVER ANSWERS PHONE CALLS. She has a high school or college student who works from home and the owners calls get forwarded to her! I could go on about her EXTREMELY INADEQUATE ""assistant"". She proceeded to send me texts to my cell phone to attempt to apologize for the owners SECOND NO SHOW. So, so, so unprofessional. HOW ABOUT A PHONE CALL?! WORST SPA EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE BY FAR.

If you're hunting for a bed, Big Red Mattress is a great place to shop.  The people working here are very knowledgeable.  When we stopped in to look at mattresses, we'd done a fair amount of research online and looked in other stores and we were set on a temper-pedic style mattress.  When we walked in to Big Red Mattress, we let the salesman know that we were leaning towards temper-pedic.  He discussed the advantages of bamboo v. conventional materials and was able to guide us through the various options.  After talking for awhile, we settled on the bamboo version of temper-pedic / memory foam mattress.
  
All the while, the manager was friendly and very helpful and helped us find what we were looking for.  That's a serious compliment considering such a large purchase.

TeqMow367t0t4a2ZmTuvIA,zInL3eX3Y0-zYZGDxfeMAw,"Being a larger person it's very tough to find suits off the rack that fit. It's been near impossible, and I've always wanted a more affordable solution. What MADE offers me is a solution that is not only made in Canada but also delivers one of the best services I've ever had. With their new studio in place, and some of the best experience including a Scotch while I went through my consultation, the knowledge staff helped me go through the process to becoming a MADE man. 
How the experience worked was they asked me detailed questions to help me have a better understanding of what exactly I was looking for, and helped me narrow down the hundreds of different fabrics they had. After settling with a beautiful blue Reda herring bone fabric, we went to chose the lining that best matched the suit. I went with a white paisley lining, and topped it off with tortoise buttons, white under collar, baby blue button holes and topped it off with my monogram. 

Excited to wait for my suit to finally arrive, 3 weeks later, I received an email from one of the consultants and raced over to the studio where I was handed another Scotch and tried on my new suit. 

The fit was spot on right away, and didn't need any adjustments. Finally I was able to find a suit that fit me perfectly regardless of my body type. 

I've been back since to order a blue plaid sport coat for the summer time, and can't wait to pick it up!

While it is part of a larger hair salon, Anna and her colleague seem to run their own nail shop from inside.  Anna has always done my nails - and it is done perfectly every time.  I have my nails done with Shellac, but I know they also use the OPI version, as well as other nail polish brands.  Anna really knows her stuff.  If my nails didn't have that pesky habit of growing, I'd never need to have them redone.  Anna is really friendly and the whole experience is fantastic.

I'm used to Toronto prices, so these ones seem more than fair, and the website clearly explains their ""no tipping"" policy.  Amazing.  Did I mention their website allows you to book online, day or night?

This has been a refreshing change from the dime-a-dozen low end places that I have been begrudgingly visiting.  After being treated to such service - for prices lower than I would get in the city - I can't imagine changing nail places any time soon."

As soon as she finished the other customer's transaction, she found me and asked how she could help.  She helped me to choose a new foundation, that matched my skin tone and my skin type.  As I was checking out she gave me a sample of a new product to try and told me when it was gone, she would supply a second sample so I could be sure I wanted it before purchasing the full size.  She also sold me a face wash, helping me to understand how it works and why it would be good for me.  So far, I love the foundation, face wash and the sample product I was given.

RJkBJOhekr-JP7yJSpcYbw,QTsB8VtGe46nUbMAZd87uQ,"I'm not sure what we could have done better on our side, but U-Haul failed to deliver at every possible opportunity. My girlfriend and I looked at multiple options for moving our stuff from Phoenix to Seattle and this was the least expensive option. A tip for everyone out there: Don't choose the least expensive option unless you don't need your stuff.
First, we stopped in multiple times to our neighborhood store (Sunnyslope) to confirm everything that was going to happen before we even made our reservation. After we made our reservation, we stopped in AGAIN to the store just to clarify everything looked okay.
The morning of the big day, we showed up to find the reservation had been moved to a different store (19th Avenue) a few miles away. There, we waited about an hour for everything to be dealt with since they were also unprepared for this change. The worker there was pleasant and gave us a discount on mileage since we had to drive a few extra miles (though it was not free). This was on 6/8. Our stuff was guaranteed to show up in Seattle by 6/19. Also note that every day late, U-Haul guaranteed us $50 back.
On the 18th, I called (I should mention that each time I called, I had to call 2 or 3 times because I had to keep being transferred from store to distribution center and back since everyone had a complete lack of empathy since I'm sure they hear this stuff all the time and they just wanted to pass this off, frequently with them saying the ""area manager"" was going to call me whenever he got the chance and I never heard from him) and I was told the driver had not gotten in touch with U-Haul and they didn't know where our stuff was, and that we should have access to it on the 20th. Every day after that, they said it should probably arrive in town the next day until on Tuesday, they said it was in town, and scheduled for DELIVERY noon on Wednesday. Mind you, this whole time, we were completely without furniture and sleeping on the floor. That's not U-Haul's fault, but we might have made other arrangements had we known it would be delayed this long.
Wednesday at 12:30, no calls. I called, and they said the delivery person called in sick that day but they could deliver it the next day. I had plans, so I re-scheduled for Friday at noon, and they said they'd call that morning. Friday morning, no calls. I called like crazy and finally decided to go down to the store where our boxes supposedly had arrived a few days prior. We met with Josh (one of the managers whom I was told was supposed to call me for a few days) after waiting for about an hour in the store, and he was very friendly and helpful. He hadn't received any messages to call me, and he said the boxes hadn't arrived. I hadn't checked that day, but the new estimate for delivery was 7/8, a full month after we packed them. As we sat there in disbelief, the trucks with our boxes physically pulled up to the store, and we worked out same-day delivery. It became very clear nobody at U-Haul knew what was going on, but clearly, everyone at the distribution call center was great at lying about it. The delivery cost about $150 more than we were initially quoted in U-Haul's system, but we wanted our stuff.
As the delivery happened, for the first time, someone from U-Haul ACTUALLY called me. It was Moe from 19th avenue. He was very helpful and offered $100 to make up for a complaint I put in earlier (I don't remember this at all). I explained that I wanted my guaranteed $350 money back because my stuff was showing up a week late. He said someone would call me later.
After not hearing anything for a few days, I called. Moe called me back the next day and, since his system said the boxes were only 5 days late/the guaranteed date was 2 days later than what I had said (the ""guaranteed date"" kept changing whenever I checked, but I saved a copy with the original), he offered me $250. I explained that I wanted my $350, and he said that the $250 would be in addition to the $100, so it'd be the guaranteed $350. I was annoyed that I didn't get the additional $100 he initially offered, but I took it. I never wanted to deal with U-Haul again.
But of course it wouldn't stop there. After about a week, it finally showed up on my card as a CHARGE of $250 instead of as a CREDIT/REFUND. I called back, talked to Nathan, who was very friendly, and after a few more calls, he processed a refund of $500. I only write this today after I can see that this finally went through. It's been over a month since this whole ordeal started, and while everyone who worked at the stores was very nice (big ups to Nathan, Josh, and Moe), the call center is terrible at customer service and the entire organization is painfully unorganized."

So far there have been a few hiccups, but none on the part of KNC. (Deliveries, HOAs, time frames shot by delayed deliveries, etc but all outside of KNC scope)  I currently  reside in Seattle, but Nick has done an excellent job keeping me informed, sending photos, budget information, along with all the licensing, permitting, material orders, deliveries, and in general apprising me of any structural or HOA situations as they arise. I find them to be exceedingly detail oriented and consciousness.  Not only do they lay down two layers of plastic in the halls, pad the elevators to prevent damage, but the job site is bar none one of the cleanest sites I have ever been on. I mean the boys sweep and vacuum the halls and stairs everyday before they leave. They even try to do the ""heavy"" work after a reasonable hour to accommodate a downstairs neighbor who works nights. They are licensed bonded permitted and insured, which was a far cry from many of the sham artists I found working in Phoenix when scouring contractors.  I was really surprised to see the bad yelp reviews especially after being referred to KNC through  a restaurant owner who had them do a remodel on his own home. I asked about it as you all know I am an Elite yelper so I gotta know these things. KNC obliged in providing me court documentation to back up their side of the bad reviews upon my request. Its sad these people are smearing what I have found to be a great company. I cant wait until completion of the reno, imma blow your mind with pictures I am sure... right now though because my custom cabinets arent in, and the doors wont be here for 6 weeks (way to go on that custom order Home Depot) I can only really show pictures of sheetrock so I will refrain till October.

-IHNt19SD5Bz7zHq5pPaLA,RNUV7k_Ng4KdasXQMsOo6w,"Mixed bag here - while they did fit me in for emergency work when a tooth cracked, they tried to push unnecessary work with biannual cleaning.

Pro - when a tooth cracked in half, they got me in for temp repair, found a great specialist (offsite, unaffiliated) to do root canal and then they did an ok job on a crown. 

Con- The crown is showing wear after only 3 years. I will prob need a replacement at 5. When I made a biannual cleaning appointment with them, stating I wanted just the free service paid for via my insurance, I arrived to find a $700+ bill waiting for me! I inquired if it was for the previous crown as that had been paid but was told no, the dentist had added invasive services to my cleaning. I replied I would not be getting those, just the preventative care cleaning covered by insurance at 100% They refused to do the cleaning unless I took and paid for in advance all of the extras. (Cutting gums, scaling, etc) I refused and walked out. 

Long waits in crowded room, really just a number to rotating, faceless dentists. I'll never go back or recommend."

I understand they have a liquor license to protect but the way the whole situation was handled was very unprofessional. I'm not going to go into depth with what happened but this event upset me to the point of where I will never return to play here, which is unfortunate because I used to play a majority of my golf games here.... and I play a lot of golf. Not a smart move on them from a business standpoint, especially for a business that already struggles with sales."
DZ4EHnAsirGI6Nm14LPR1A,nNtI1xRXcZs5R3sBEa8xqw,"We approached Graham Floral Shoppe to do our wedding flowers. My fiancee (at the time) and Christa (their designer) sat down and discussed what kind of theme and flowers my fiancee likes. We sent them pictures of the venue and Christa took care of all the designs herself. The staff, which is largely the owner's family, coordinated with the venue and wedding coordinator, then they came out to the venue and set everything up. And the flowers were just absolutely stunning. Nothing at the wedding was complicated more than the flowers. 

If you're looking for flowers for your wedding or any big event, you should definitely check out Graham. The designer is incredible, the staff were a delight, and they just made everything so easy. Not to mention that they arrangements were incredible, and yet the price was very competitive. I give Graham floral shoppe my highest recommendation."

It has a filthy parking lot that seems as though it's never been power washed and there is always goo all over the trash receptacles. It's a very tight lot for parking and getting in and out of it takes skill. One must be very careful pulling out. Also, an FYI, be aware of the gentleman in the wheel chair who sometimes blocks the entry from the Southern Ave side. He's harmless but I worry that he may get hit one of these days. 
The inside of the store needs serious cleaning and organization. I realize it's a small store and in a busy area, but more attentiveness to cleanliness would be a positive. The employees, so far, have been friendly."

I would have gladly given this experience a five star save the fact that there was a double booking issue. Bruce resolved by giving the other client another time and a free massage. The treatment room was beautiful. The hot stone foot massage and the hot stone under the neck at the end of the massage was a nice finish to the session.

We also enjoy browsing the shelves for a treat of delicious chocolate, or European cookies.  The prices are reasonable, considering the food is all home-cooked and high quality.

They have a special beef or chicken bento box for 8.50$ (around there) that comes with a generous helping of rice, your choice of beef or chicken, edamame beans, california roll (I think) and vegetable tempura.

Cook makes the food fast so that you can tame your hunger, the portions are perfect and by the end of eating it all you wanna lay down on the sofa / bench / chair / sidewalk and just take a long nap.

If you hit up this spot after 2:00pm I believe all the sushi is also 50% off."

Reasons I feel this way:
1. The store is DIRTY. The merchandise is dusty.
2. The Merchandise is sparse and spread out to make the store look full.
3. The items are WAY OVERPRICED. WAY OVERPRICED. ex. A 21"" Waterproof dog collar here $16.49. I can get them everywhere else for  $ 11.99.   
4. Service was horrible.

kgMnjojFdS77cUtbR-queQ,cuQJlMArABjR2Pmhcd-Nqg,"This is the first time my wife and I have had firewood delivered so I can't really compare Mazzola to other businesses but as far as I can tell, they were great. 

I had called several firewood delivery companies and Mazzola was the only one that allowed us to say specificity when we would like the wood to be delivered. The other ones had set times and days they would deliver. 


The driver called a few minutes before he arrived, giving me time to put on pants because the sun reflexes off my tan-less body, blinding passersby.  Something I thought was cool was that when the wood was dropped off, it was just the wood I had ordered in the truck. We only needed the lowest amount they delivered (1/3 cord) but they didn't push the small order to the side so they could get to the larger orders. My 1/3 cord delivery wasn't treated as a ""quick stop"" on the way to a larger order, is what I mean.


My wife and I are definitely going to be ordering from Mazzola Supply every year."

My daughter's friend was trying on a few things and asked an associate to hold two shirts for her. She then decided that she wanted a dress instead, so she told the associate that she no longer wanted the shirts, just the dress. My daughter was paying for her items and wanted to buy her friend the dress. The associate totaled her up and said it was $107. My daughter thought it was a bit high for what she had, so she removed one of her own shirts from the total. She paid and walked out the store. When she was outside the door, she looked inside the bag to discover that the associate had rang her up for the two shirts that her friend had specifically told the lady that she no longer wanted!!! My daughter walked right back inside to return them and was told that she could only have ""in store credit""!! This is ridiculous!! It was the associates fault!!! I told my daughter to just use up the credit next time (at a different location), and to never shop there again!!!"

As for dry cleaners the one on happy valley is their site they do the dry cleaning,  other then forgetting to fold we have had no issues.  But their customer service in the last 6 months had dropped from great to let's find a new location.  But I need to address the alteration they do at this site.  We need a place and our dry cleaners on happy valley indicated they had one, I said are they good, and they said well the work is good but you never know what your going to pay.  Then they said and don't make her mad.  We found this to be true enough that we are seeking a new location.  We were on our 6th shirt to be altered, after she did the alteration she gave the price and she said it is 30 a shirt.  What happened to 25 she said owner indicated that he was raising the prices on all items.  Then I said I believe we paid for this, the lady said your a liar it isn't our policy,  well because we use the other location at least once a week I looked and we had two charges, without seeing the details I didn't knew if we had paid her in advance or not.  So I got a different card from what my husband used and said we have three charges so if I see it is a duplicate I will just charge it back. She became so rude then didn't want me to take the shirts.  She couldn't produce a copy of the pick up detail that she said showed what we owed.  So I called the dry cleaners and they said she sets her own prices not the owner.  When I asked if I could get the owner info they would not give it to me,  they said he doesn't have anything to do with her.  

You will not be unhappy with her work, but she will not quote you a price or even idea of a price and she changes their is no customer loyalty with her.  They have three dry cleaner names they use, zounds cleaners, vista and lake pleasant."

The facility is clean, well lit, and very well attended.  The 40 pound Speed Queen washers are $6 for 34 minutes.  Regular sized machines are $3.  Driers are free if you pay for wash.  

Facility is clean, lots of machines and I even see the attendant actively wiping down the machines and engaging with the customers.  

Good music - Marvin Gaye, light jazz, sax, soul, etc - not my taste but customers some times singing along.   Gotta love that. 

The only odd thing is that I was not able to find this using any Yelp or other searches.  One customer commented that was intentional to ""keep this a secret"".  With that in mind, if you come here ... Don't mess it up!  OK?  OK!

One caveat: the neighborhood is pretty run down and my visit was on a chilly Sunday AM.  Your experience may vary based on when you go - I advise going early rather than late.

PS - Walgreens is next door if you need something (drink, food, reading, etc)"

My car rarely breaks down! After the car broke down the 3rd time we found out that they put the wrong belt on it and there was still a broken part that held the belt to the alternator. So my dad fixed it when we went to tell them they said they couldn't do nothing because we didn't come to them first. But we would be left paying the towing. Bottom line is they just weren't doing the job. The first time we took it to them when we drove home the check engine light came on again. And they said it was a whole different reason. So odd. I'm going to take a guess and say they do well with some cars but others if they are not sure they're going to get their consistent business they will be dirty with you. Be careful!

cTIBCbaOPJ2a8oVTEIrTrQ,FXPGGtOlCawxz5Uw5DNF3A,"If you are looking for an office/admin job AppleOne is not a bad resource. If you need a terribly large amount of hand-holding in the process, you might want to look elsewhere.

I ended up using AppleOne after applying to a listing they had posted on Monster and getting a call from one of their recruiters. i made an appointment and after filling out a series of forms, taking various policy quizzes and completing a battery of proficiency tests for the software I claimed to be familiar with, I received email notifications of available jobs and occasional calls from my recruiter about positions for which she thought I was especially suited. I went on between 5 and 8 interviews over the approximately 2 months I was searching with AppleOne. While my recruiter was always insistent that I call her afterward to see how the interview went and whether I would be interested in the position if it were offered to me, she was not generally very good at providing the promised follow up when the company made a decision. Also, getting ahold of the recruiter was sometimes tricky. Since their time is apparently very limited the reception staff can be a bit persistent about attempting to help you themselves, which can be hit or miss, but I could generally get a message through which was usually returned within a few days

I did eventually get one of the positions for which they suggested me (and she did let me know about that). During the 3 months I was employed through AppleOne, I would occasionally receive feedback from the recruiter about about how my boss thought I was doing, though she did make these phone calls at rather odd hours. The online timecard system AppleOne has set up is straightforward and reliable, but it doesn't load properly on some browsers, so you may need to download one that it is compatible with (Firefox falls into the A-ok category, Safari does not). The direct deposit payment plan is convenient and payments were always made on time or early.

I would use AppleOne again, if I needed to find another office job, but I would also recommend job seekers continue their own searching efforts after joining the AppleOne applicant pool."

But one day, Rexall told me that they were out of one of my prescriptions and there was a month long waiting list I was on. Allergy season makes lots of prescriptions hard to come by. They suggested trying another store, but warned me that waiting lists could be all over town. Undeterred, I remembered that there was another drugstore near the dollar store. So I got in the car and headed to Paragon.

The pharmacist at Paragon was incredibly helpful and patient, even during all the back and forth and being put on hold by Rexall in order to transfer my prescription. It took nearly half an hour waiting for Rexall to fax in my information (probably not their fault, it was busy in there when I left to go to Paragon), but I finally got my ""impossible to get"" medicine! Yay! Popped it open and used it immediately (because at that point, my nose was completely clogged and felt like a fist on my face). Quality of life magically altered and ataraxy took over.

The receptionists are rude and ignore you upon entering. You repeatedly hear people complain about not being seen on time and no seems to be notified that it's likely they will have a long wait time. The only reason for my continued visits is the fact that the doctor knows my medical history and the location is quite convenient.

The last time I went in, they made their falafels fresh, and they were delightfully crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I love that they have beets as a salad option. 

Service here is incredibly friendly, and I will definitely make this a regular stop from now on, whenever I'm in Southcentre."

jqcnwuhyzgL4kSVxVeJgzQ,MydYq5iMmRNVNk4K-GnXgA,"Went to the Big 4 dealership to meet with Michael Cybulski on a recommendation from a friend. Let me start by saying that if I hadn't ended up buying a car from the dealership, I would still highly recommend Michael to anyone looking for a vehicle.

This was the first new car I had bought. I had gone to the dealership with an idea of what I was looking for. Instead of just sending me on a test drive, Michael took a lot of time to talk with me about what I wanted from a vehicle, what I liked and disliked about my current car, how long I planned on keeping it for, vehicle features, and honestly things I hadn't really thought about all together. From there he made recommendations for me and took me through all the vehicles he had spoken about. We discussed what they would offer me, answered endless questions and only then did we go for any test drives. That initial conversation was a great eye opener for me and I found out a number of things I hadn't even thought about in regards to buying a new car as this was my first time. 

After the test drives we spoke about each of the vehicles. There was no pressure and he gave me all the information I asked for and needed. We spoke about how long he had been with the dealership, why he stayed, what he liked about the cars he sold. Really got an idea of his experience and knowledge too. The car I was looking at had a great deal on and we spoke about deadlines to make an offer to make sure I would get that price if I decided to go with it, once again no pressure. Also got to speak to Michelle in in Finance in regards to options and guarentees. And again I was offered all the information I could possibly need with no pressure. She ever went as far to lay out what the process moving forward would look like should I wish to go ahead.

 A few days later I called to say I was interested in the car, Michael did a search to make sure I got the colour I was looking for and appointments were booked with Michelle to finish up all the paperwork and to finalise the sale of the car. At no stage did I feel rushed and when going through the paperwork Michelle did a great job making sure I understood everything before we moved to the next step. After the paperwork, Michael and I went through all the bells and whistles on my new beauty. He has also made sure that I get in contact should I have any questions for him and that I was fully aware of the after service plan I had in place.

I am going to own my new car for a long time, and my only hope is that one day when I do look for a new vehicle I will have the same amazing experience that I had with Michael and Michelle. I highly recommend both of them!"

Thursday I get a call telling me they have 3 price options, including fixing motor mounts???? I told the guy there I just wanted the exhaust fixed. He told me it will be done Friday morning. Friday came and I hadn't heard anything by 3pm so I call to check. Once again the guy tells me it will be done by the next morning. Saturday around 10 am and still no call, so I call back to check. Once again the same guy says that it will be done this afternoon. I told him I will be there at 12pm so have it done. I get there at 12:15 and he hands me the keys and says try Meineke!!! I couldn't believe what I heard, I asked him why it was not done and he said he doesn't work on the cars and he has no idea why it is not done. I reminded him that when we spoke Thursday it was on the lift, so why not finish then? Again an I don't know. This was the worst experience of any shop I ever had, very unprofessional.

My husband and I have brought our car to him for years, and I've never taken the time to write a review. He deserves to be recognized for the top notch service that he delivers. I never leave there feeling like I got ripped off. He always has worked to give me the best price possible on the services we need for our cars. Today was a highly stressful day with several medical situations in my family, and I was without a car on a day that I could not afford to be without one. I wound up having to rent a car for the day, and knew that if there was one person who was going to help me get my car back in working order it was going to be Michael. Sure enough, he delivered in the nick of time. It was a costly repair, but he provided a discount, and played a positive role in helping this challenging day get better.  He is a valuable asset to Discount Brake. Don't take him for granted."

After scouring the city for a sectional to replace our falling-apart ikea couch, F2 was the only place with the best selection that was also reasonably price for high-end furniture. The couch we bought was a custom piece, made in Canada and the price was really unbeatable for what we received.

Both girls that work there are super helpful and friendly, they made the whole experience really easy. I believe it took about a month to get our couch shipped in and the only hiccup we had was when we brought the sectional into our place and unwrapped it, the legs on the smaller sectional part were completely bent. When we went back to the store I was expecting to have to plead our case (the legs were already bent when we got them!) but Bryan instantly gave us replacement legs for free (other furniture/design stores take note...this is how you should treat your customers!). We changed the legs when we got home and have enjoyed our beautiful couch ever since :)

They also carry local artist's work, like paintings from ACAD students/grads and these cool customized pieces from como designs. 

It is definitely worth checking out!"

If you have a family member or friend in need of anything related to mobility--whether long term or just a visit, Jeff and his team are knowledgeable, professional and most concerned with fulfilling your needs.  They're also very cost effective.

YD8C2WoDt5WOIao-Em3hhw,B_4cl4IGRqYb0wQSe-rYjQ,"I have so much venom and hatred for this place that if I had all the money in the world I would PAY PEOPLE TO AVOID. They are only out to make a buck and that's all good for a business but you kinda expect a doctor's office to care a teensy weensy bit about your health.  One of the doctors here tried to get my husband to come in just to get a prescription for his blood pressure medication (and it's a commonly prescribed medication)  each time he needed a refill.  Of course we would have to pay the co pay for each visit.  When my husband challenged them, they agreed to fill the prescriptions and go along with the regular check up schedule.  Now, that wasn't too bad, right.  I wouldn't give one star for that.  The straw that broke the camels back was when I went for an appointment and checked out at the desk.  The girl was so busy talking to her coworker and hitting the keys on the card scanner that she ran my card for $1000 instead of $10!!! When she said she cancelled it out I immediately logged into my bank account from my smartphone and SURE ENOUGH that transaction put $1000 of my money on hold.  I stood in their office and the bank said it was not showing cancelled on their end.  Instead of the girl apologizing she said to me: ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO"" and had the audacity to giggle!!!!!!! I'm sure someone there had to see the fire flames shooting from the top of my head.  (I can laugh now) Ultimately, my funds were on hold for 5 DAYS and it's a good thing I had it in my account to begin with.  There was no remorse for what they did so I found another doctor and took my business there.  tHERE ARE MORE HORROR STORIES BUT I DON'T WANT TO TURN THIS INTO A NOVEL. 

DON'T LET THEIR CONVENIENT HOURS ENTICE YOU...YOU WILL BE SORRY! I will continue to share my story and warn folks about this place FOREVER."

I ordered a teriyaki chicken rice bowl, the veg was 98% cabbage and 2% carrot, no broccoli etc resulting in little flavour.

If you are a teenager or a cheerleader, or want to listen to calming nature sounds and smell incense, you should not come here. But if you honestly want and need to feel better--if you have body aches and want a place that takes these issues seriously, Green Tara is your place.

Etc. Finally I got someone knowledgeable and helpful on the phone. But what a hassle!

Choice Hotels seems to have some excellent properties. And, when I called for help with a reservation today, the agent was exceptionally helpful!

We would've been better off getting some random people off of the street, which is where I'm sure they found these employees. They were very immature and yelled at guests. They even talked badly about guests as they walked by. As if that weren't enough they couldn't even handle standing for a short amount of time. They constantly sat down playing on their phones and didn't even bother standing or looking up when guests came up to them. Instead they yelled and pointed to where the guests needed to be and yelled louder and more obnoxiously when the guests were foreign and didn't even understand English. Worst customer service I've ever experienced with a company."
_E0uYmCuRhPVYRwhssgKGQ,TGrZk61ja7X1ijAGW5lNmg,"READ THIS VERY CAREFULLY.
 
I'll make this straight to the point:
 
The food here, generally tastes good and seems of a better quality of what you normally gets from the competitors.
However, I feel that this place deserves a 1 stars only because you can't rate them 0 stars. And here below you'll see the reason of my rating.
 
This is not the first time that I hear colleagues complaining about either being overcharged compared to the advertized price or having the feeling that something was missing or different from the item previously ordered.
Today, I had reason to believe that probably my coworkers were telling me the truth.
 
For three days I bought the same item. For two days I walked away not knowing that I have been served with a sandwich that had different ingredient/s from the one advertised because an employee decided to. It did not taste like expected but because of the look, I couldn't tell exactly what it was. Were the ingredients not so good? Was something simply not added? Hard to tell.
 
So today I've decided that after I placed the order, I would have ""followed"" my sandwich so that I could see if anything was wrong.
The gourmet items SHOULD be served with eggs (scrambled), bacon, BRIE cheese and apple slices.
What I discovered is that the BRIE cheese was switched with a cheap, processed slice of cheddar cheddar cheese (not even real cheddar but the processed sliced like the ones Kraft makes).
 
Now, when I pointed out to the employee, he replied with the usual answer that sounds more like it was an oversight when, really, it wasn't.
When the same mistake happens again, like in my case, 3 consecutive days, that CAN NOT be accidental. That has been done on purpose. It's intentional and so, it's fraudulent .
 
Would you be happy to go and buy a Lamborghini, drive off the dealer and feeling that something is not ok and find out only later on that under the hood you have the engine of a Cobalt?
What would you do? How would you feel about it?
............ Exactly, that's what I thought. The logic that applies to the dynamic here, is the same.

I'm sure we all agree that this is wrong to the point that I strongly believe that this business, no matter if the food is decent or not, DOESN'T DESERVE you as a client nor your hard earned money.
 
SHAME ON YOU!"

1.  They refused to book me in at my preferred location, so I have to drive out towards yorkville.  They also suggested I book on a Sunday, but and then when I arrived tried to make me feel guilty for booking on a Sunday - like they were doing me some favour.  
2.  The lash pro person was late.
3.  The process was painful and lasted hours.  I had to stop at a pharmacy for eyedrops on the way home because I couldn't make the drive back.
4.  The lashes looked great on the first day (the only positive here)
5.  They were extremely uncomfortable to sleep in.  
6.  I was told not to get them wet!  I got these done for a beach vacation (dumb idea).  It also made it really hard to wash my face or eyemakeup off. 
7.  I was told not to wear my normal make-up, as it would react with the lashes.  Make-up remover was also a no-no.  Basically, anything natural or oil based is bad.
8.  They started to fall off about a week in, and when they did they got clumpy.  They also pulled out the natural eyelashes onto which they were glued.  Once they were all gone, it took awhile (about a month) for the natural eyelashes to fill back in again.  I could have hired them to remove them or fill with new ones, but didn't want the hassle of seeing them again.
9.  They added me to their email list and, even over a year later, continue to SPAM me despite endless requests to remove me from their mailing list.  I've tried blocking but they don't always use the same email address.

Overall - I will never do this to myself again.  Not recommended."

Fast forward 10 years. It's not what it used to be. From the front desk staff to the actual massage therapists, everything has gone down hill. 

My last 2 visits were in Oct 2010 and April 2011. The guy who did my massage in Oct was so new and had no clue what the heck he was doing. I was so upset that I actually phoned the manager to complain. It was one of the worst massages I have had. 

The manager called back and apologized and offered a gift certificate to come back at another time. Which I did much to my disappointment.

The front desk staff was young and seemed too busy with her personal issues to barely acknowledge me, offer me a robe, or to tell me that the whirlpool was out of service. I think this pertinent information should have been relayed to me when I phoned to book the appointment a few days before. I was furious. Having to wait for someone to go find me a robe didn't make me any happier either.

One of the things I look forward to most is relaxing in the hot tub in the women's change room. With your massage, they allow you to use the facilities (swim pool, gym) and I love to sit in the hot tub before or after my massage. If I would have known that it was out of order, I would have rescheduled. No one there seems to care about anything any more. 

The one thing I don't like is that if you get a therapist who is upstairs, you have to trudge up the stairs half naked/in your robe to the room up there. If you're lucky enough to be in the room next to the change room, it's not a problem. Always make sure to ask if you can be downstairs. It totally takes away from the treat of massage when you have to walk all over and worry about your robe flapping open. Not relaxing at all.

I decided after these two very disappointing experiences, I will never return to Fitness on 5th. The staff there doesn't seem to care and it's not worth the money. There are plenty of other places in this city who value their customers and treat them with the respect they deserve. What used to be such a great place has turned into a complete disappointment. Don't bother with this one."

This is a chain with only 4 locations but we'll spread out.

They are busy, very busy all the time but their chicken is so much better than St-Hubert.

The sauce and fries are not as good as that other rotisserie chain but the chicken is so tender and juicy it more than makes up for it.

Their ribs are also succulent and lip smacking good. 

Prices are a bit higher for delivery and some great deals are pick-up only but it's worth the trek. 
There's no indoor seating and only a couple of outdoor benches in the summer but take it to go and eat it the nearby Beaubien Park"

Went in it was nice and clean. We waited for about 10 or less it was not busy at all only one person ahead of us. The lady taking the blood drawn was very nice and friendly towards my son made him feel comfortable which was great. The only thing is the parking lot is being shared with a hospital right next to it and it was very packed couldn't find parking close to the building had to park on another building that was next to that one. I will definitely come back to this quest diagnostics.

Was working up here and came in a few times.  I have ordered the burgers and the sandwiches they have.  All pretty average.  One day I went in and the chef had some Indian food on.  I was told the best.  So I ordered.  It truly was the best.  He made his own chutney which was spectacular.

I have been told there are two chefs.  You want the lunch time one for the specials.  Good eats.

The parking is horrendous.   It is usually full........ Of bad Asian drivers.   I can say that as I am also Asian and sometimes fall into that category.

ynkKXXf6OaIuyHxQweEwXw,zQlNORxj3S6kOLzuk_qIZw,"Um...no, not closed. NOT CLOSED in 2011, and NOT CLOSED in 2012, and won't be closed in 2013, either. My review in accordance with Yelp guidelines: This is a small ""house church""-type place, which is spiritual (not religious), always good services on Sunday mornings and they have fellowship after service. It's an excellent alternative to the other, similar churches (Unity, Science of Mind, etc.) that may seem larger and more intimidating to first-timers. Nothing intimidating about Logos. At all. In fact, the ministers go out of their way to make newbies feel welcome. I'm just flabbergasted as to how and why Yelp has this place as closed which it is not - I repeat, not - NOT CLOSED. See Lori's review from 2011: still accurate."
jVbRU4XnTRrhzqLhfibUPw,zQlNORxj3S6kOLzuk_qIZw,"Note: The earlier review (from 2007) is when a different church occupied the building. The newer review (from 2011) is when New Vision Center was in the building. Lest anyone get confused making sense of the two previous reviews.

As Ronney stated, it is a welcome, inclusive environment based upon universal spiritual ideas. If you're a fundamentalist Christian, you'd think they're Satanists. If you're Catholic Christian, you'd think they're Satanists. In other words, they don't take the Bible (or any sacred text) to be so word-for-word literal. In fact, it's not a Christian-based teaching per se, though it is religious science, which is ""New Thought,"" a spiritual lineage that has its roots in the early 1900's. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who wrote ""Sherlock Holmes,"" would have loved New Vision. 

New Vision has classes and discussions about A Course in Miracles, Eckhart Tolle, ""The Secret,"" stuff like that. 

They have classes and workshops throughout the week. Sometimes, different groups in different classrooms. 

HOWEVER, and this is a big however worth noting, the congregation is 80-90% baby boomers and seniors with maybe 10-20% Generation X'ers and young adults. That leads to a not-very-exciting music ministry where you'll typically hear the boomer-groovy likes of Joe Cocker, John Lennon, even show tunes...but you're not likely to hear any of the guest artists covering ""True Colors"" (Cyndi Lauper), ""Days"" (The Kinks), or ""I'll Be Your Mirror"" (Velvet Underground.) That makes for a very weird experience at church: hearing your parents - and grandparents - favorite music at church. Not a good way to attract young people to your church.
   
Good people, loving people, but if you're not a baby boomer or a senior citizen, you'll probably need to go a few times to get to know them. Otherwise, you'll begin to feel out of place real quick."

1wBKFqiR3vN4-6lmwBGXAQ,d_IFkIwz3jzt6yRIpTttsQ,"I have to thank Church's Chicken for finding this restaurant.  I went to the plaza on 35th Ave., next to WalMart, in the mood for some fish and chips, which Church's just introduced.  As I got out of my car, I saw the banner for DJ's Fish and Chips, and thought, ""why not try one of the local restaurants?""  I was pleased with my decision.

As I walked in, I found myself in a sparse, spacious room with small tables with cushioned chairs around the place.  I was greeted by a woman with a big smile at the ordering counter.  The range of food is small, and might be considered BBQ: fried or grilled fish (reading the online reviews, I gather it's catfish), different kinds of BBQ, and a few sides, such as coleslaw, collard greens, fries, and mac n' cheese.  I went for the fried fish, fries, and coleslaw, paid, and waited for my order at my table to eat there.

There is not much to look at on the walls--just one large TV kinda loud and a smaller TV with no sound on to keep you occupied, plus a stand for New Times--always a good standby.  There was a chess table in the corner with pieces on it which had a sign saying ""Do not touch"", and a few rough-hewn wooden boards with hand drawn or painted sports team logos on them.

When my order finally came it was quite generous.  Several large pieces of fish, lightly breaded, were piled on top of each other, with the fries on the sides and bottom, and a slice of Texas bread cut in half at the bottom.  The fish really melted in my mouth: the breading was flavorful but not overdone, just a bit salty (but I've been cutting down on salt, so it may have seemed moreso to me).  The fish and the fries were not greasy at all.  The fries were nice and crispy.  The cole slaw was well-balanced, without too much mayo or sweetness--just right. The woman from the front checked with me a few times to see how everything was.  Service with a smile.  She told me they'd only been open since June of last year.

Check them out at www.djsfishandchips.com and support your local business!   I know I will again!"

5PGJ1gh8NNN3nWTDoVRfCw,jJ5FJdYy1kpscl4kB_kQNg,"Massive LCBO. Great selection of already chilled beer, coolers and wine. 

Fabulous selection of higher end wines, even a cellar. They usually have a wine tasting going on which is great if you're looking to try something new. 

Their staff are always willing to help out with a pairing and don't make you feel ridiculous for asking. 

It's a beautiful store the way things are displayed and marketed. There is always a lot of staff on the floor. 

Oftentimes the website doesn't match up. I've been looking for a specific wine and they don't end up having it even though the website said they had three in stock though. Call and check first before going. 

The parking lot is a nightmare because of Shoppers Drug Mart, Starbucks and Whole Foods. I dread having to go here on weekends because of this and why I took away a star. 

There are often long lineups, but they typically call anothe staff member to open up another cash. 

I went to return a few bottles of champagne the other day and because I no longer had the receipt, I couldn't get my money back. I understand other stores, but since you can only get alcohol from the LCBO in Ontario, where do they think I got it from?! Either way, gift card just means I don't have to pay for my wine later!"

HkwL8meWL2N81C33Ex2Sug,5znAGtfj1BVesV7GrrZL5A,"Where to begin ... I'll start with Karen is AMAZING!  I started seeing Karen in 2017, after more than 20 years of GI issues.  Notwithstanding my ongoing efforts - many long appointments with specialists, myriad lab tests, prescription medications and so forth - I was never correctly diagnosed nor treated and had essentially given up, resolved to live in a fair level of pain on a daily basis.  A few years ago, my husband saw Karen and raved about her, and after some foot dragging, I finally went in to see her.  Immediately, she correctly diagnosed my issue and we've worked together for the past months to resolve it.  I'm feeling better than I have felt for a very long time, and am SO grateful. One of my children has a related health issue.  Unfortunately, Karen does not treat children, but the experience I have gone through in trying to get my child correctly diagnosed and treated (let's just say, I've kissed many frogs) is an ongoing reminder that not all practitioners are competent and ethical, the way that Karen is.  Karen does not advise in areas beyond her expertise, but has good referrals to practitioners more knowledgeable in such areas.  (She eventually helped me find a practitioner for my child.). She does not sell supplements or run tests through her office (as some practitioners do), so you know her advice is not based upon her personal financial interest, but is instead based upon what she truly believes will benefit her client.  You will not walk out of her office with a laundry list of supplements to buy and practices to incorporate in your life.  Rather, you will walk out with a short list of manageable strategies that have been explained to you in detail (and that - here's the best part - actually work).  Finally, Karen meets you where you are and does not expect perfection, and does not judge.  And, if all of that was not enough, she has a great sense of humor and is simply a lovely person.  JoAnn, her assistant, is from New York - you can tell from her accent.   I have had many long conversations with JoAnn and my personal experience is that she is warm, caring, knowledgeable, extremely responsive and hard-working.  She has always followed up with me and gotten me answers to questions in a timely manner.  If there is any downside to Smart Nutrition it's that, because Karen is SO competent, she has a lot of patients, and you may have to wait a bit to get in to see her. Well worth it, though - patience pays off."

All of the employees are professional and I'd bet the other therapists are awesome, too.  Can't wait to go back again!

I arrived at the location to pick up my truck for the move and the lady at the counter tells me they don't have the truck.  She offers me a 16 foot truck so (2/3) the size I needed.  She acts as unconcerned as could be.  Then she makes this my fault by saying what did I expect I only made the reservation that morning.  Does that really matter.  She offers to call her boss, then 15 minutes later tells me he is not back in the office until Monday.  She refers me to customer service, where I talk to 1, 2, 3 people then finally get my issue escalated to a supervisor.  The supervisor tells me, too bad.  He then says he will have the inventory manager call me back.  The call back time frame is an hour and fifteen minutes to two hours.  At the 2.5 hour mark I call back in and after talking to 1,2,3 people I get told the inventory manager will call me when they get to it.  There are a lot of people who are waiting for a call back because there are not trucks.  I go ahead and cancel the reservation.  About 45 minutes later I get a call from the inventory manager.  He says they don't have any trucks that I requested.  Again he can get me a 16 foot truck. I express my frustration, he tells me he completely understands because the system is really bad and he spends his day trying to fix something for the unhappy people.  SO at the end of the day I rented from Uhaul.  They took care of me, they were cheaper, and the staff was much better!  My guess is Budget tells you they will get you the truck you need only to downsize you into a truck that is too small.  It helps them move their inventory on less frequently used trucks.  Never say never, but it will be a cold day in July before I even think about renting from Budget."

We met with a rep in a makeshift office and was guaranteed by him they would get us out of our timeshare. He said there would be no problem as they were experts in getting people out of their timeshare and they had the ""secret recipe"" to do this. We were promised it would take 3 to 6 months to get out, possibly 9. Our maintenance fees were due in 3 weeks and he told us not to pay them as to do so would indicate we didn't want to leave. After talking with this person for quite some time and having him over and over tell us how good TET was at what they do, we signed on feeling good about our decision. 15 months of scripted emails telling us a bunch of bull and 3 Client Managers later we are told they received a ""Notice of Trustee's Sale for our timeshare property and to allow our timeshare to be sold under this structure will be out of our timeshare with no future obligations to them whatsoever, and not through the payment of fees to the timeshare."" But get this, it will affect our credit, which is excellent! Or toВ pay all past due amount that includes fees (which our rep told us not to pay)late and service charges, and if we don't pay the negative ramifications of foreclosing can include but are not limited to a court summons or a judgment because we have a legal obligation to the resort and our fees.В WHAT?В Seriously, after 15 months this is what you come up with? I could have saved my money I paid TET and still had this same outcome! What kind of lawyers are actually working on this? Where's the secret receipe that is getting us out? They have provided no proof they are doing anything other than the same scripted emails every month. Oh, and they offer me this too, ""Where our customers have seen credit hits from this, we have worked with them to provide credit repair services. We'd be willing to do so for you in this circumstance if necessary, should you elect to allow this sale."" And at what price is this for I wonder. They say this is free but after dealing with them I highly doubt it.В Is this the secret recipe: Don't pay maintenance fees (on advice of TET), eventually they sell your deed because you reneged on your payments, TET gets more money out of you to supposedly pay back charges and repair your credit? And I read other reviews where people paid the back fees/charges snd their credit was still ruined! I would give a negative rating but one star is the lowest! I will change this rating if, and only if TET gets me out of my timeshare, free and clear with no additional money and not affecting my credit!"
pwJ02k23oZcu3JFMx43uMA,ZfIDArNjrfsQwcsDHeMZmg,"I hate how in Montreal the SAQ, the alcohol control of Quebec, has the gambit on many alcoholic beverages.  For example, although you can buy bottles of wine in the grocery store, they are generic reds or whites with no year.  However, only at the SAQ can you buy good wine.  Only at the SAQ can you buy microbrew beer from the US.  Only at the SAQ can you buy liquor.

Nevertheless, I can't let this bullshit control board cloud the review of the SAQ itself.  I like that the SAQ depot exists because the more you buy, the more you save.  For instance, if you buy 3 bottles of wine, you save 3%, if you buy 6 bottles you save 10% and if you buy 12 bottles you save 15%.  Saving money is always good!

While they may not have the best of selections, like other SAQs (e.g. SAQ Selection), they do have a fair representation of each region.  Also you can achieve the same savings on liquor, which is nice...you can even mix and match, with 3 bottles of liquor and 9 bottles of wine and still save 15%.

IMHO, this is the best place to buy proper alcohol in Quebec at a decent savings."
iwuMHLKwiBRBqjocHJTFOw,VZRxANvyTm2ixS6jYDGgEw,Allen was knowledgeable and accurate in our pest control problem. He saw what others couldn't and was very honest with the pricing. He was surprisingly prompt for the estimate as well. I highly suggest Allen and this pest control company for any insect needs.
EKojJqzqw_aTzDYDKAwpUQ,w8q1hum7FsGb6hb9T_2j2g,"I've used these guys several times when I have short term overflows of space with my business.

The place is really great, has after hour access, staff is cool, and it's secure.

I only graded it down because they say the first month is free, but they do tack on a admin fee or something.  It's not much.  I think around $25.  I'm sure all the storage places that offer this deal do the same thing.

They do sell additional insurance if you need it, and boxes, tape, locks, etc for your convenience"

First let me say... when they were closed after the January, 2013 fire, I was despondant.  There just is no better liver available anywhere else within the WSM.  Trust me, I've tried them all.  Foster's has tender, fresh liver which is just a joy.

I also rely on them for my annual rib roast for Christmas.  Oh good gracious... it is just jaw droppingly beautiful and tender.  

These guys are friendly and so very helpful.  Even with a busy Saturday crowd, they are on their game, and quick.  

I'm so glad they are back in business finally!  I missed them very much!"

Everything happens for a reason!!! Thank you Nick for saving me any future issues we would have encountered with you and your business!!!"
K1xhqMJJS6gFwJEJSmGbdg,1lAE-MMYPAvfR6qEgE3nCw,"I went here for a cut and style before attending a wedding. Nothing went wrong, nothing particularly amazing. There were about 5 stylists just waiting for customers when I arrived on a Saturday morning, so no trouble getting in. The stylist was friendly, and did offer some 'tips' for recreating the style on my own which was nice. The price of the cut was good, the price for the style seemed a bit high for what I got.

They don't take appointments."
SSQTjbJ_EhEsQYK7bWT81A,cSeEs2GCzZvVVbpl2oEk4Q,"Horrible company, horrible customer service. We've had them through our landlord for several years now, but scheduling is always an issue. It seems that their internal communication is non existent. Although they know we prefer Saturday appointments, every time we're due for quarterly service, we get an email or text that we have a random service coming up on a Tuesday at 10-12 or Thursday at 2-4. 

When we call to reschedule (an inconvenience) and they seem surprised that there is a note stating we prefer Saturday appointments and aren't sure why this happened every time.

The latest event was yesterday. We were scheduled 1-3 on Saturday (after we rescheduled a service we didn't know about till we received a text), and at 11 am I receive a text asking me to rate the service. Hard to say since we weren't there and didn't know they were coming. The original tech didn't know who did it, said they must have assigned a different tech. And when we called the company they had no record of how it got rescheduled. 

The whole company is a mess. I asked them if they are looking to downsize or lose costumers so they could try and better service a few rather many. Maybe it's a business decision to scale back, but this seems a bad way to do it. Or maybe they don't care about individual residential accounts and contracts. They really didn't know how to answer that."
xrkWUEBHLtENNntDo66jLw,P20hVHiQ7IA0Z9Wox5v-0A,"My water bill had increased by 4 fold for the month of March, so I suspected I had a significant leak somewhere in my system. The question was where and how to find it. I called upon Ruiter construction for diagnose and repair. My decision for choice of contractor proved to be the right one. Mr. Ruiter and his competent staff members first found the leak by employing a logical process if steps that eventually pinpointed the location of the problem. Having found the ruptured water line I was informed of the specific nature of the problem. The communication to me was clear and concise. I was given options as to what solutions were available with all associated costs. The work was then completed in a efficient fashion and the problem is now completely resolved. The price was more than fair and the workers were polite and informative as the project drew to completion. I strongly recommend Ruiter construction for any project  and will by using them for any future needs I may encounter,    Charles Cline"
7mPa7HVCfOkaE3GIFiTWgw,dAfdS9l7DOMze3orptDxiQ,"Great company!! I had an unexpected leak in my house and they helped me from beginning to end. This company was recommended by another company and I had the pleasure of dealing with Raul and his team. THANK YOU!
Long story short, the leak caused LOTS of damage to my house and WFM was there to help and guide me with everything I needed to do. The gushing leak was fixed, the water damaged areas were removed/dried out completely, and everything was done in a timely manner. Even with construction going on inside the house, they were very neat (they put plastic over everything making sure not to make a mess or damage anything else). They are avail 24/7 so call them when needed! It is a headache when something like this happens and I'm glad WFM made it easier."
z37K7WEXTybpbdX58LnYQg,aSwLvhvERxCJQWUvFE_htA,"I've lived here for four years and this place is in a VERY steady decline. The property is poorly maintained -- trash EVERYWHERE from cigarette butts to beer cans and vomit (True story -- I went to get on the elevator one morning and it opened up to what appeared to be a Pollock-inspired vomit masterpiece). Every Sunday this place looks like a post-rage frat house. Security is very low on the totem pole for property managers as gates are always broken and wide open and cars are constantly broken into. (Don't complain though, they'll highlight that they stated in your lease that they aren't obligated to provide a safe environment) There's a homeless man living in the garage that frequently urinates there so hold your breath if you're going to walk through there! Any other complaints? Keep a written record -- the person that you spoke to about it likely won't be working there the next day as their leasing office is a revolving door. When you finally make it through the filth to your out-dated apartment, try to sleep tight cause the bugs will absolutely bite! Spiders EVERYWHERE! At one point, we had maintenance spraying for spiders at least twice a month. I could keep going but I don't have much time, or even much space here to list everything wrong with this place. But I'll end with one good thing -- they're cheap. But you'll get what you pay for!"

One of their competitors referred to them as a ""Mom and Pop outfit"" and that couldn't have been farther from the case. Crews arrived every day on time, worked hard and cleaned up every day. The plaster was jackhammered out and replaced with pebblesheen, and new tiles were set. The result is a brand new pool. The whole experience was fascinating to watch and everything happened that was promised. I also called after each step to see what was next and the scheduler was always organized and knew when each crew was coming. Excellent work and very professional. Start to finish was just over two weeks. I would definitely recommend them."

QWKwqPmjMj9E5F4W4fFwpw,3D2-zw1n2L79AKNQTZ77IQ,"My girlfriend visited this convenient store late one night to get a few things. She used her debit card to pay for her purchase. The next morning she looked at her bank account only to realize she had been wiped clean of all her money.

Last night, despite what had happened a week earlier, her and I returned to Gardenview since it was the only store open at such late hours. I decided to pay for my food using my debit card since I had no cash on me. We spoke to the manager that night and explained what had happened to my friend. He was completely useless in the matter and pretty much told us off. 

This morning I checked my bank account and long-behold my account was wiped clean. No money!

I've had friends have problems with them before and I sense they might have a chip reader. Something is not right there. I've called the cops and hope they will investigate deep into the matter.

I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO NOT USE ANY DEBIT OR CREDIT CARDS THERE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED."

When I booked them, I was under the impression that they were a floral and decor design company only, however, they offer planning from start to finish as well! Major win, a one stop shop! 

I had the BB Squad build a fresh flower + greenery wall for our ceremony backdrop and HOLY HEAVEN, it came out even better than I had ever dreamed of! {See photos}. They also put flowers along the aisle chairs to spice up our aisle experience as well. Kate is one of the most talented floral designers that i've ever met and her sweetness makes the entire design process fun and seamless. 

Trust me, they can make ANY wedding decor vision come to life. If you have a vision but aren't sure how to make it happen, seriously contact Bloom & Blueprint, they WILL make it happen! Pinterest ideas aren't scary when you have a dream team who can actually create your vision! I can't thank them enough!!!"

The gentlemen that I dealt with I believe he was the owner was very friendly and knowledgable on showing me the different tint options and pricing. Since my car is black I ended up getting the high end film. I would suggest making an appointment it did take a few hrs. I did notice a few bubbles in a few areas the next day. I gave them a call and they said it needs to completely dry and then the bubbles should dry up if not feel free to bring it back. The bubbles did end up drying up after about 5 days. I would suggest if you have a black car that needs a nice tint job this is the place.

I could go on with my particular story but it would be far too long.

So, this is a teeny bopper store, make no mistake about it. Trendy fashions, not super high quality, but the prices are quite reasonable. Bright, cheery, and the employees are friendly most of the time. I've found some great pieces for casual wear and nice accessories. However, be forewarned, these aren't pieces that will last forever. The pair of gloves I bought last week got a hole in them as soon as I put them on! But if you need a ""one hitter quitter"" outfit, just for that day, then Rue 21 is your place to go. Of course, because this is a store primarily for teens/tweens, sizing will run a bit small."

We have two big neon size lights and did not want to unwrap them and everything if the pawn shop simply didn't want anything to do with them. We showed them a picture of the exact item we had.

""Companies"" overseas contract with them and they essentially provide a hub to ""do business"" with you. By ""do business"", I mean scam. Anyone in India (main culprit) can contract them, set up a hole in the wall in some alley and have calls from the USA routed to them. GC provide dialer services, meaning they sell them your phone number, dial it for them and connect them to you. This is typically done with local numbers to give this scamming a legitimate feel. They provide them point of sale services, through which they can bill your credit card. Then they keep a fee or a percentage of what the scammers bring in.

If you receive a call from this number (6023579425), you will surely be speaking to someone from India, attempting to convince you that you are being sued by the IRS and that you need to pay up. When you web search the number, you will come up with Global Crossing Local Services.

This is backed up by searching the BBB database and web searches on their business practices.

wQLmGR_7WG_ganJogeuBRw,ogn_Dby6pBXNMcP3TGidIA,"Horrible ""Customer Service""

I visited this Rogers location on Sunday March 16th 2014 to acquire a new phone, as the night prior both my wallet and cell phone were stolen. Two months prior I had purchased a Nexus 5 from this location through my account with Rogers, and seeing as how the only ID that was in my possession and had not been stolen was my passport, I decided to bring my passport & the receipt from my prior purchase as proof that I was authorized on the account (My name is on the account). The self proclaimed ""manager"" was so unbelievably rude & refused to help me. (Might I remind you once more that all of my worldly identification documents had at this time been stolen the night prior).  I left the store empty handed, and was told to acquire further identification. 

I never write reviews, but the way that this individual treated me was just absurd and not at all acceptable. Correct me if I'm wrong but am I not the CUSTOMER? Does your job as a customer service representative not entail you to service customers as opposed to berating them and go as far as smirking and pointing whilst you berate? 

This was by far the worst experience I have ever had ANYWHERE. Oh and for some off reason I have been a Rogers customer for over a decade. Definitely rethinking that decision."
zu0dRWFf6cDkGmO8BjPvHg,yth8cSAszBTqc1wMdns7_Q,"I moved into O'Neil Towers with a friend, after being a tenant of various Boardwalk properties.  

I have nothing but AMAZING things to say about this building, although it did have its downfalls.  I will list them here as honestly as I can, as I know a lot of people want to know the nitty gritty details of apartment complexes.

1.  The Staff are IMPECABLE!
I dealt with 4 key players during my tenancy at O'Neil Towers, S, D, A and  Buddy.  All four are amazing people, willing to go above and beyond their job descriptions to ensure you are happy with your home.  I think 3 out of the 4 of them actually live in the building, so chances are, if you are angry about something, they understand.

2.  The Elevators Suck.
I lived there for a year, and there was always one elevator out of service.  Mind you, they are shut down so they can renovate them to maike them faster, but when 20 people are moving in on the same day, and they block one of the two working ones off for move-ins, it can get a bit hairy.

3.  The location is AWESOME.
Not only are you steps away from the C-Train, you are also living in a building that has a convienience store WITHIN IT.  That meant that I could go down to Amy's Confectionary at 9:30 pm in -40 degree weather in my pajamas and slippers.  You can't even ask for anything better than that.  You have McDonald's, Subway and Tim Hortons just down the block, as well as Great Canadian Pizza right downstairs, which has the best Butter Chicken I have had in a long time.  You also get to know all the staff of these places, and really makes you feel like you live in a close knit neighbourhood.

4. I had a crazy neighbour.
I don't mean that I just didn't like her, I mean she was bonafide bat shit crazy.  It was the general consensus of my floor that she was Schitzophrenic, but she would slam her door at all hours of the night and yell at people who weren't there.  She pestered my guests, but after living like that for 10 months, I finally lost my mind and yelled at her.  Loudly.  She then apologized and we never heard a peep from her after that.  This means, you have to deal with some things on your own, as Boardwalk can't fight all your battles for you.

5.  The pool is sweet.
I did not use the pool to its full potential.  It was under repair for the first part of the summer, but when it opened, it was like having your own rooftop terrace.  (the pool is on the 5th floor above the parkade)  A lot of fun can be had there if you actually use it.

6.  The gym is great.
Brand new equipment.  Also an extremely attractive maintenance guy who works out.  I won't lie, I have used him as an excuse just to get my ass down there.  

7.  The view.
I lived on the 19th floor, West facing.  I had the most amazing view you could ever hope for, a clear shot of the mountains, the Bow, fireworks from the McMahon stadium , and a wicked view of Dicken's Pub on Saturday night.  Its like going to the zoo, but free!

The apartment itself was in great shape, newer appliances, a dishwasher, storage closet, really big master bedroom, and smaller second bedroom.  The master bedroom had a full size closet plus another little shelf closet, perfect for books, shoes etc.

I would recommend this place to anyone, moreso to people who do not own vehicles.  Parking for the building is through Vinci Parking, tenant rate was $85.00 a month.  (hey, you're down town what do you expect?)  Should you not own a vehicle, you're set!

Telus is the main provider of cable and phone, alot of times they have promotions through the building.  I got my interent as well as the essentials cable package for free during my tenency.  My electricity bill was on average $35 per month, so I am not exactly sure where the last review got that from.  Enmax is WAY more expensive than that.

All in all, I love this building and I was very sad to leave."

This place is located walking distance to ste catherine where all the tourist traps are and the metro so its conveniently located. Its a condo style place and you rent out the rooms and share the ""communal place"" which you dont really need anyway. There is a kitchen and a living room and a balcony but we rarely used it unless we were eating Patryck's fantastic 3 course breakfast!

So, if you stay here, every morning he prepares a gourmet 3 course breakfast, hence the name bed&breakfast. You can request anything, and he will make it. The first morning we had a bowl of fruits in the shape of a happy face! It had oranges, pinapples, canteloupe, and kiwis! I'll update photos (I think they will be the first on yelp?). the second course was caramalized cinnimon apple crepes with sweet syrup, and the last course was chilled yogurt with bluberry topping. 

The second morning for first course we had fresh figs, grapes, canteloupe and grapefruit. the second course was spinach ommelette with balsamic tomatoes and wheat toast. The third course I forget because I didnt take a photo and I forgot. Sorry patryck, but I am sure it was delicious!

The rooms are spacious with a window, ac/heater, huge bed, tv and closet. the complex has wifi and a very nice and clean bathroom. The beds are comfy and Patryck is such a sweetheart and so nice! He can guide you anywhere to music festivals, kinky adventures, bar hopping or clubbing. He's from France but his English is cute. 

A+! I'll be coming back again :)"
u_kWEHBNYXLEJZohnC_RLA,tCEaldIdx26w4atkokioew,Have been having Cindy cut my hair over a year and she always knows how I like my hair cut. She is always very meticulous about making sure that my hair looks good and I have everything that I need taken care of before we even leave the chair. I recommend scheduling an appointment with any of the ladies in this establishment because they are always in good spirits and will joke with you even if you are not their client. Fantastic place.

I let them know that I would also be getting a full set of acrylics done and they sat me at a nail table and 2 of the others at the pedicure chairs. That's fine I thought maybe j would get the acrylics first. Waited 30 to 45 minutes before I was acknowledge by anyone there and finally placed in a chair after multiple walk ins had been seated. Once that was done they finally got me to a table again to do my full set only to cause my cuticle to rip open again and bleed and the nails. I requested almond shaped nails and they gave me oval shaped and the pedi was supposed to be their basic pedi instead knowing this was my first pedicure they threw in the hot stones and charged me for them when I never requested them. They failed to inform me that getting the almond shaped nails would apparently cost $7 extra so what was supposed to be a $40 dollar bill became a $50 bill that I was uninformed had gotten to that. When approached about it they refused a refund or anything and accused me of falsifying the bleeding incident and threatened to call the police on me and my boyfriend when we came back. Very rude and yelled at us the whole time we just wanted either a refund or compensation for making what was supposed to be a relaxing time with my grandma for her birthday into a stressful event. 
They make prices up as they go.
Very rude and poor customer service.
Doesn't respect appointments made.
Unhygienic when it comes to blood.

A lady took my money & when she was giving me my change back, she gave me a $5 bill, & when she went to give me the rest of my change, she missed my hand with some of the coins. She leaned out the window & looked where she had dropped some of the coins in the snow. After doing that, she looked at me, closed the drive-thru window & walked away. She never offered to replace the coins that she dropped in the snow, when she missed my hand. When I was given my order, I asked the guy, who the lady was that just took my money to pay for my order. He said that she was the boss. The other people in my truck, couldn't believe the actions they witnessed by someone who is supposed to be the boss.

Bi8p2JS1Om4PKpf6lRNWVg,3p3FecILXHRPPhXdzCL0uA,"Probably fine for direct deposit and withdrawing if you're a student nearby. But I've had a number of screw-ups originating here that would make me never trust this bank for anything beyond that. 

(1) After another PNC branch screwed up a transfer by failing to submit it, I re-did it here (taking an hour of my time). I was told the fee would be waived because PNC had wasted my time; it wasn't and nobody bothered to inform me about the outcome or why it the fee-waiver was denied. (2) When clearing out my account via wire-transfer, the person failed to include the wire-transfer fee either via cash or by taking out the proper amount (balance - the fee). This left me in the red and forced me to take my own time to go in (while attempting to move out of the city) and fix the issue. 

In each case, a torrent of apologies ensue from everyone involved. But at some point, I don't care about apologies -- I just want a bank that works, and when a bank screws up, for it to not charge me for botched work."

Frys had a flash sale on Halloween candy, the whole purpose of me going to the store, 50% off candy today! Well, I was unable to find any signs for this one day sale. I asked a customer service rep who was walking by and he was not aware of the sale. I asked him to find out information from the manager. The associate returned back pointing to a few empty boxes. I informed him of the email that I received and there was a huge variety in the picture. He was not so helpful and I asked for a manager again. He explained the manager was at the register, and so I asked for another manager, Frys has more than one manager on duty. He returned with the front line manager who was also unaware of the sale, once I showed him the website on Kroger, and the flash sale, he immediately offered to assist with the customer service and said that it was not clear on the displays of the candy sale and said pick up the candy that I wanted and he would price it at half off. I explained that I planned on buying quite a bit, I use candy at all my meetings all day long. He assured me the 50% off the purchase. I picked up candy for each of the various providers and members who come to my meetings, as I get a variety of requests for various different types of candy... people love their favorite candy. I bought a tremendous amount of candy and he assisted me with the check out. I could tell it was a long work day and another associate approached him during my transaction and he mentioned after this, he was leaving. Honestly, this front line manager made the difference by going above and beyond to ensure customer service and satisfaction. Very impressed with this service and many people will be benefiting from this transaction. He had no clue how much it means that there are candy during the meetings I hold.. chocolate is a stress reliever- well that's what I hear..this was by far the best customer service manager I have ever came across in all my years of shopping! I am also going to mention that this store is clean- always... and very well staffed. There are always people in the various departments in the grocery store, not like other stores in the valley!

pmaNU670HnISO_6tXD3wkA,l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,"I wasn't going to say anything since some time has passed, but it's almost a civic duty to comment on this event in the hope that it will either improve or never be attempted again.

Trouble started right at the gate, when those of us who'd waited in the line for pre-paid sales were directed to re-queue in the line for those who still needed to buy tickets. Somewhere on my phone I may still have the video where I'm asking the woman to confirm that we'd just waited in the pre-paid line and to confirm that she was now telling everyone in the line, one at a time as they reached the front, to go to the back of the other line. 

Hint: when your customer takes out her phone, turns it on, says, ""I'm going to record you,"" then asks you to repeat what you just said, maybe it's time to turn on the charm a little and not act like the entire line is full of stupid people out to inconvenience you.

Although I'd bought a ticket online, Mike had won a ticket (thanks Yelp!) and was told he just needed to give his name at the gate. He explained this to the person with the list. They didn't understand. He explained again. They just let him through without bothering to check the list. They seemed to decide it wasn't worth the bother.

What am I talking about, saying that trouble started at the gate? It actually started a week or so before that, when I tweeted the organizers to ask which restaurants would be providing Indian food. ""It's going to be a contest!"" they cheerfully replied. ""We'll know soon!"" 

And then they never replied to another tweet again. Ah. One of those businesses that thinks they can put a big Twitter logo on their advertising, probably thinking they're so social media-savvy, but then they use it as a one-way ad channel, oblivious to interaction. 

Once inside we were of course greeted with the free slot pulls that only require that you give away your name, address, phone number, and email address. Classy (sarcasm), but common (alas).

We kept our minds open as we skipped the usual ""nothing to do with this festival's theme"" row of booths that show up at every festival. We also ignored the carnival rides corralled at the end. It was about noon and we were ready to eat.

Is it a good sign when the ""flagship"" food booth at an Asian festival is Panda Express? Complete with giant inflatable panda? 

A few good (by experience or reputation) eateries were represented in that single row of stalls, but the whole environment was grim: stark white tents against the washed-out asphalt of a parking lot down the street from the back of the Orleans. The sun beat down.

At food festivals, like at the International Food Festival (at least when it was downtown), I look for a chance to try several different things without spending a lot. I don't mind if full meals are offered, but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect an a la carte emphasis that means you hit up a few stands before sitting down somewhere pleasant with a little of this and that. (At this event you could sit on a chair in front of the stage or at a table under a smallish tent.)

I noticed that most stands only had full-size combo platters of some description for sale. Prices weren't bad, but they weren't so different from the regular menu prices, either. Except here there was the disadvantage of only being able to order what was on the limited festival menu.

After waiting at Mint's booth a few minutes, we turned to each other and said, ""Why?"" Why get a combo plate when, for pretty much the same price, we could just actually go to Mint? Or to any of these (few) restaurants? And sit somewhere nice? And have waiter service? And order what we actually want? Why were we about to stand around in a parking lot and eat this food?

I could understand the appeal of this festival if you had cheap/free tickets *and* a small child who hadn't had enough of the spinning swings at the other fairs running around the same time, but if you were looking for a way to pleasantly sample a range of Asian fare, it would be 10 times more fun to just wander the aisles at International Market down the road.

We left and went to an old fave down the road for a delicious Indian buffet. When we mentioned that we'd just come from the festival, the manager said that they'd been asked to participate, but it didn't seem worth the cost. So, that's how you win the ""contest"" to get to be one of ""three only"" representatives for that region's cuisine in the festival. (As the festival promoters had advertised.)

Skeezy misinformation and misdirection. No ambience. Rude staff. Minimal cultural wares or entertainers. Disorganized gate. Limited food options. Limited variety in Asian cuisine (unless you count the Greek booth?). Pointless ""festival."""

Each time, I've been extremely impressed with the quality and the mix of produce.  

I compared this week's basket of goodies to prices at Grocery Gateway.  The same items came to $9 more than I paid through Organics Delivered.  

Unlike GG, you're not customizing your grocery order when you go with Organics Delivered.  You can tell them what things you definitely never want to find in your delivery, but beyond that it's up to them.  

I thought this lack of choosing would be off-putting, and it may grow tiresome at some point.  But so far I've found is that I enjoy luxury of not having to make all the decisions. Urban life has too many choices.  It's paralyzing.  Just bring me some of whatever's fresh.  

Also, I had been avoiding these sorts of organic delivery services because I had a fear that they would only deliver the kind of vegetables that only your friend who can't stop talking about nutrition could possibly like.   You know, like six pounds of Kale and something called Spelt Butter.  But each order so far has had your mainstream fruits & vegetables: carrots, apples, oranges, pears, lettuce, potatoes, etc.

We try and take our boat out every Sundays and is 20 dollars daily pass admission driving into the reservation grounds, certain water vessels do have a fee. 40 dollars for annual pass (speaking my language...pinch pinch that penny!) Even if you didn't have that extra 20 bucks to get that annual pass that day, you still have 7 days to go back with your day pass and make it an annual one.

I haven't seen much litter on the lake myself if you are concerned of the cleanliness of the area. People will look out for one another by warning you if the currents are too choppy passed a certain point. It is only 30 minutes away from where I live, convenient much????

There are also different areas of The Massive Man-Made lake...you will be given a map and be able to go where your little bitty heart takes you, such as:

Callville Bay Campground and Harbor where you can cruise over in your boat or jet ski to Dead Man Rock or find your own little secret cove to set up your tanning location. 

Lake Mead Marina - if you like being around houseboats.

East Lake Mead where you have several other relaxation areas to unwind, like Temple Bar (not really a bar) or South Cove.

Keep in mind that there is a place called Lake Las Vegas here where you can find residence and resorts...beautiful!

I would love to name them all if I had the time to but if you must research.....

FD4shyeIHnv8gBlnrAjEOQ,UjZxJMWPiyvA2FngE8giaQ,"If you are looking for a more ""classic"" Yoga kind of style, Sivananda Yoga is the place to be. 

Probably the oldest Yoga place in Montreal, you can either ""jump"" in a class or register for a number of classes. Which is very cool, especially if you have a busy urban schedule! 

Each class, you have a different teacher. So if you don't like the teaching style of someone, you are not stuck with him/her for the next 10 lessons. It last about an hour and a half. The first 30 mintures are usually some small yoga-related exercices such as breathing and relaxation. Then, you go on practicing. And, during the last 15 minutes, you have the relaxation part. 

You can bring your own Yoga mat, or they will offer one to you if you don't have one. 

In the room that I was, there also was a small shrine which included images of important leaders of most of the different religions of the world. Which I thought was very respectful considering that everyone has different beliefs. 

A very nice place to practice Yoga. It's about 10 minutes a walk from Metro Laurier, and well worth it!"
nWlbFIXG88cg3N6vffhCBw,BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,"I stayed at the Edward Hotel recently with my parents when we had a wedding to go to in Markham. This hotel is also known as the Edward Village Markham and the Edward Markham Hotel. It's listed under different names on different sites. It used to be a Delta. Overall, our stay was ok.

I booked through Hotwire and paid $104.61 per night inclusive of taxes and fees. 

The lobby is really nice with lots of comfy chairs to lounge around. There's a restaurant attached called Tivoli Garden. 

Rooms were clean and staff were nice. We got a regular room and the fridge was tiny. It used to be a mini bar because the door had a lock on it, but the key is now permanently chained to the door. There is no freezer. We also did not have a microwave in our room. On my way out one afternoon I asked the front desk if none of the rooms had microwaves and the lady said that only suites and upgraded rooms had microwaves. As I was heading out, a man who looked like he was the manager or a supervisor chased after me (in a helpful not creepy way) and said that there was a communal microwave in the lobby that I could use. He then lead me to this room that looked like it was a business centre once upon a time but was currently a storage room of some sort. It was a bit dusty and not too well kept. However, it had a microwave in it. Props to him for trying to be helpful, but I really think they need to maintain that room better if guests are going in there. I did not use that microwave, but I guess it's nice that I had access to one should I have wanted to use one.

Toiletries were also a mishmash of brands. The mouthwash was June Jacobs, the shampoo, lotion, soaps, and body wash were Eco Logical, and the conditioner was another brand entirely. I found this a bit unusual.

There were only 3 easily accessible plugs in the room, so if you have a lot of devices, you will have to plan your charging schedule, lol. 

Breakfast is not included, but parking is. There's lots of spots. WiFi is free and reliable. I never got booted out (although you have to sign in again every 24 hours).

East Valhalla Drive is a one way street, so you can only access the hotel coming from Highway 7. You cannot access it coming from Cochrane.

Overall, an ok hotel to stay in. I feel that in terms of appearances it's more aesthetically pleasing than other nearby hotels of the same cost. However, I prefer hotels where microwaves are standard and where the fridge is a bit bigger."

It was a Friday evening after 7 and I called to see if they were still open. The man on the phone assured me that they would take me when I came in. When I got there, the man (who turned out to be the owner) greeted me and offered me green tea or water. He even sat down to start the process of taking off my shellac while the other technicians were still busy. The brand of shellac I chose wasn't the greatest (iGel if you're wondering) and the technician made no qualms about doing 4! coats which I thought was pretty above and beyond.  They genuinely thanked me for my patronage on my way out. Now, because the brand I chose was shitty, it chipped the first day (trust me, it does not speak to the craftsmanship as she did a great job). I returned a few days later to correct the chips. No one seemed annoyed and the owner didn't charge me and even apologized for me having to come back. Seriously great customer service and the prices are very reasonable."

I have been here twice for small things, this last time for my brakes.  They open early, so you can take and drop off your car.  The mechanics leave around five, but since it's a gas station, there's someone there later so you can pick up the car until around 8.

Also, they seem to be really fair.  I do not think they are the cheapest in town, but seem to do only what the car really needs worked on."
VmZ6sLWZhdo-EAvz8D5orw,j6wLUT0ZXi-x0otelYIFpA,"No words. They should have sent a poet.

I came here for a work holiday party last night. We booked the entire restaurant and it was the perfect size. We were about 20 people, and there was a coat check and a little bar set up with room to stand around. The tables were arranged in a circle with an opening so the servers could go into the circle and provide the food. 

The food was AMAZING. Apparently our work set it up so that the restaurant knew how many people were coming and our food sensitivities (dairy, nut and seed allergy, kosher and halal people, people that don't eat red meat... we're quite the bunch) and just set up a menu for us. The owner came out before the food was served and had a little speech ""We cook with a lot of fat, so if you're on a diet... you're in the wrong place."" I knew this was a good sign.

It was tapas style, and we had :

Beet and endive salad (great balance of slightly bitter and sweet)
Quinoa and tomato salad with pea shoots
Sweet potato and something soup
Potato and meat croquettes (so good!)
Lamb sausage
Mini burgers
Chicken schnitzel (perfectly crispy and tender)
Tandoori chicken
Sea bass (light, buttery and perfectly cooked)
Lamb chop (amazing)
Slow cooked beef rib, which they put on a table in the middle and carved in front of us (amazing flavour and tender as hell)
Roasted potatoes
Roasted root vegetables
Dessert that was: mini dark chocolate lava cake (LOVED), custard in a pastry, dairy-free ice cream with fresh fruit

Everything was either good or absolutely amazing. It was a marathon of food and wine. I was in absolute heaven. The atmosphere was cozy and the service was spot on. It couldn't have been a better experience.

Apparently, it's not uncommon for people to call a few days ahead and ask them to create a special menu for them. I have no idea what it cost, but I'm definitely going to be back."

The AC is more than likely broken because on some days it's hotter in there than it is outside. The biggest problem is that on Sundays it does not open until 12 PM! The equipment is old.

I took my computer into Pak computer repair and things went from bad to worse.  I dropped the computer off because it wasn't charging.  They had it for about a week when I called to see what was going on.  Patrick, computer repairman, said I had a bad power cord.  I repeated to Patrick the same as my wife told him that I had checked the power cord and the voltage and wattage was spot on factory specs.  The then insisted it was the power cord to the tune of $59.  I said to first check the power port on the computer, an easily replaced part that cost about $20.  He again said its the power cord.  I said can you guarantee that an he said yes he guaranteed it.  I said go ahead and try it if your 100% sure.  He said ok and that he needed the $59 up front after my wife paid him to check it out. I was surprised because I own an auto repair shop and I would never ask a customer to pay for the parts up front but I figured that he is guaranteeing that the cord is the problem. 

I had an old dell computer at work and found the exact wire, that I knew worked, for this computer.  I took it in on a Monday to try it and see if it worked and it would tell me if it was truly the cord.  When I got there to try my cord I found that Patrick took the power port had been taken out of the computer even before Patrick had received the new cord(very suspicious). Patrick just happened to be off that day.  

The new cord came in in 10 days (I checked on amazon for one and they could deliver it in 3 days) After he checked the new cord surprisingly it didn't work either.  He told me he'll check it out again.  The called me a week later and surprise, surprise he said its the power port and its only $10 and asked me for my credit card again.  I said to take it out of the $59 power cord that he guaranteed me was the problem.  (I again would NEVER charge a customer for a part that I misdiagnosed).  

Another 6 days and he called me and said it was the power port (that I asked him to look at in the first place) and the computer was charging fine.  Total result, $192, 2.5-3 weeks without my computer and being lied to about guaranteeing (which means to me no charge if he's wrong).  

I have a total of 14 computers with my business and home and I will never go back to Pak computers again and you shouldn't either.

Just a footnote: I am not a previous employee, a spouse of a former employee, or affiliated in any way with anyone that works or worked there.(the owner seems to accuse bad review on everybody else when he should be looking in a mirror for the problem."

In one case the guy who was standing at the ""pick up food"" area right at the front missed his food because there was an employee walking around the restaurant with his food instead...

1 star for generous size of my burrito, 1 star for being a portable taco carrier with charming style.

The burrito itself left me sadly underwhelmed, and I was HUNGRY. Usually being hungry results in any food being oodles more delicious...but alas, not here, not now. There was an odd sweetness to the pork from the BBQ sauce, which makes sense if you're going for Americana style pulled pork, but I suppose I was hoping more for a carnitas or savory/salty take from my burrito filling. I could have done without the BBQ sauce as it's just not a flavor profile I associate or enjoy with my burritos...and I like barbacoa well enough. All of the ingredients were either practically flavorless or overwhelmed by the BBQ.

Half an hour after completing the little burro, I found myself feeling nauseaus and sick. No bueno."

Not only did it take the woman on the floor twenty minutes to even acknowledge that I was present in her empty store, but she was incredibly rude and condescending. She didn't listen to what I was asking and led me to hydroponic equipment telling me that's what I need. After clarifying for the 4th time that I want to grow an INDOOR VEGETABLE GARDEN, she snickered and told me that no one can grow anything edible indoors, except for herbs. What a bad way of doing business. There are SO MANY options out there indoor vegetable gardeners, and there are SO MANY better ways of handling a topic you may not be comfortable with.

The reason that I mention one of them, and not a left or right upper front tooth, is that Dr. Margolian not only matched the colour so well, (I am a Graphics Imaging & Colour Specialist in the Print Industry, for over 35 years), with the bonding that I cannot feel or see which tooth it was.

He was so realistic as to just how well the bonding veneer would actually sustain without requiring it to be repaired again that I thought if I were to get 2 to 5 years I would be elated.

Well, like the bonding veneer which to this day has not worn, discolored, chipped away or fallen out.
Now it has been at least 13 to 15 years or more, as I am unable to recall accurately, even with an excellent memory which is almost photographic, no pun meant.

As he used not only a tool which is similar to a stereoscopic microscope for excellent fine detail work but to my surprise, it also had different colour filters, which I believe Orthodontists mainly use.

I could not possibly ask more from anyone, an extraordinary job.

Well done Dr. Margolian!"

I just so happened to have recently stayed there....surprised?

Check in: I was checked in by the hotel manager who seemed very excited about being there. The hotel is only 7 months old, hope this excitement doesn't wear off. Keys in hand i was off to my room.

Room: All i could say when i walked in was ""wow"". the room had this vintage/Wild West feel while being modern all at the same time. I booked an ""executive room"" so it has a fire place- push the button for 30, 60 or 120 minutes and the flame ignites. It was cool as all heck. There was a large 55 inch television and a refrigerator as well. The bed, being new and all, was extremely comfortable and had some high quality linens. The bathroom was modern looking, spacious and clean. Heres the kicker: It had an automatic toilet.....WITH a heated toilet seat !(you cant even find that at the Bellagio). Walk in, toilet seat raises automatically lights up the bowl  and cleans itself!

Service: Well one example of the service here is that I casually asked if the front desk had a band aid to which they didn't. 5 minutes later the front desk person took the time and FOUND me (in my room nonetheless) to bring me any first aid supplies i needed. That may sound simple, but i didnt tell them my room number they took the time to find me and thats what was special.

I'd love to stay here again- They did what alot of other large resorts didnt do when making this hotel. Oh- not only is parking free but there is NO RESORT FEE.

I'm not going to get into water conservation, other than to say if you are interested you should head to Springs Preserve for lots of information on this subject. 

As a member of the Las Vegas Triathlon Club, I spend quite a bit of time at Lake Mead. The trails are amazing for cycling and running (or walking and complaining, with brief intervals of sluggish running). The lake is also great to swim in! The entry is pretty gross due to the lower water levels, but if you can get past the soft muddy bottom and go out a little closer to the buoys, it's nice and clear. Seriously - I am what I call a ""prissy swimmer"" and I voluntarily swim there. I have swam in other lakes where you couldn't see your hand in front of your face, at Lake Mead you can see the bottom of the lake!

A regular fixture at the beach is a nice older guy who can usually be found in his speedo, sunbathing. He picks up bags and bags of garbage each week at Boulder Beach...which brings me to the cons. People are pigs. They leave dirty diapers, feminine products and other ""gems"" on the beach sometimes....eeew. 

One of my favorite spots is Sunset Point, and I keep a yoga mat in my car just to go there after a long workout and regroup. It's so peaceful!

XdvfOAjyyxzriAfe56GdpQ,WfTgIll1OYeWpPrKubXoJw,Charged me $97 for a basic oil change on a new car. Front desk was rude. She told me it would be an hour. I can't back after 2 hours and she told me it would be awhile. There was no one working on any of the cars in there. Do not go here. I never will again. I rarely write a review but this was the worst service and price gouging I have experienced in a long time.
gf1r00kQICeeFX-7WCuXIQ,o5Ok9mr28O1MmpGaGqE6Tg,"First of all, let me say this review is in no way an indictment of the folks who work there. The staff have always been nice, helpful and friendly. I have no complaints about them. What I DO have a beef with, is the obviously VERY poor management. If you're not fighting off the meth heads who essentially ""live"" by the payphones, you're accosted by the homeless, mentally ill, and people the store has allowed to sell candy outside the door. It feels like I'm always dodging someone just to get in the door. I live just down the street and go in there almost daily. I cannot begin to tell you how many times in a month their soda fountain is inoperable. Either there is no ice for the fountain drinks,  no diet coke, no coke, no sprite, etc. It's always something. Then their ability to process credit and debit goes down a lot. Also, the gas pumps are so old and so scratched up with ""gang"" graffiti, a person cannot possibly read the meter when getting gas. AND, if you have a FRY'S card, it will not read it at the pump to give you a discount, and you must go inside (where there is usually a very long line) and wait for the clerk to punch your card numbers in. It's really too bad this Circle K has been allowed by corporate to get this bad. Corporate really needs to do a serious overhaul at this store, along with hiring security at night. If I didn't live so close by, I would never go in there."

I've been to several H&R blocks and the first one (Maryland and Twain) kept telling me that I owe $880 (total including the tax filing $1200+) I verified with my broker that I have no taxes and penalty on this one but Maryland and Twain person said, ""I've been doing this for 13 years""' and laughed at me. 

Billie Jo listened to me and she is also familiar with Roth IRA. The amount of gas driving all over the town yesterday is worth it!"

but the place proved to be danceable and nice in general.
the music was some mix of hiphop and dance electro. 

the minus is that the place is super super tiny and dancing becomes hard at the peak hour.

but definitely an alternative when drake/gladstone are packed.

I'm a pretty busy person so having the time myself has been hard to find. A very through job was done and even sanitized my yard to get rid of the urine smell. I am on schedule for every 2 weeks. Without having to do a contract I figure let's give it a go for a bit.

9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA,hv3hpcM2XMbZdYN3VQLmhg,"I moved this past weekend and hired Tom Trucker for the second time and was, once again, super happy with the job they did.  They're friendly, affordable, flexible and extremely knowledgeable...it may sound corny but they treat every customer like family and in the city, that's hard to come by.

When booking, the phone rep has always been extremely helpful and friendly - covering all the bases so there are no surprises come moving day.  How much stuff do you have, what size truck would you prefer, do you need wardrobes, etc, etc.  When you call you may get the answering machine but don't be put of!  They don't advertise anywhere but word-of-mouth recommendations mean they're always busy but no fear, they will get back to you and you won't regret it!  

On moving day, the movers arrived right on time - 2 guys in total. One of them had helped me move a couple of years ago and remembered me and where I'd lived before, which was great (especially since I was moving back to that area).  Really nice guys - friendly and polite without letting it slow them down.  They did a quick assessment of how much and what kind of stuff I had and then got right to it.  I have a fair amount of furniture (big pieces too) so there's always some tricky maneuvering to be done but they do it quickly and efficiently without any problems.  They also ask all the right questions when loading and unloading and take care to shrink wrap and blanket everything that needs it.  It's like friendly neighbours (who have a truck!) helping you move...

In 2 1/2 hours they had everything packed...bedroom, living room, dining room, kitchen and office.  Then they unpacked everything in less time than that!

The whole move (including transport) took just over 5 hours and cost approx. $520 including the sizeable tip we gave them for rocking the move so brilliantly.

Seriously...if you're moving in the Toronto area, it doesn't get any better than this!  Highly recommended!"

They take customer service to another level - the creativity and personalization brought a beautifully intimate feeling to our wedding.

K9Ycc5lO5CCqH2KMZInZag,BeoFmNoFuz-h8uso-J2_lg,"Ok, so Treasure Hunt gets it's merchandise from closeouts, bankruptcies, overstocks, liquidations, customer returns and out of season goods.  This means inventory varies all the time, so you might go one time and feel that everything sucks, but then go another time and feel that they have awesome stuff.  So keep this in mind.  

When I went, they had lots of GAP merchandise for $6-$10.  Like workout pants and capris for $10, and yoga tops for $6.  They had Banana Republic dresses (from the real Banana Republic boutique, not the Factory Store) for $25, although only in sizes 00 and 0.  They had BCBG dresses for $5 - yep, you read that right, $5!  Again, size selection was minimal, but the styles were actually pretty cute and they weren't damaged in any way that I could see.  

When I went, I was disappointed by the shoes, as they were mostly from Target.  But who knows, some other time they might have cool shoes.  

The place was a mess though.  It looked like a rummage sale.  If you're the type of person who likes to go into a store, buy exactly what you are looking for and get out, this is not the place for you.  However, if you like rummaging through junk to find a hidden gem (like I do), you'll like this place.  

They had lots of party supplies for 70% off the last price, so really dirt cheap.  They had all sorts of miscellaneous stuff.  My dad got a garbage can for $0.60 and a pair of gloves for $0.50.  I got a Champion brand workout top for $4.   

Be forewarned, the place is very junky looking.  You need patience to go through stuff, and you need to like ""treasure hunting"" lol.  

Treasure Hunt is in Dixie Mall and it's where the Sears Outlet used to be."

We were pumped and having a great time laughing and being fun, and I don't think she was able to grasp any artistic relevance for sake of angles or just capturing great pictures. Her skill was basic and fundamental and had very little personality. Her socks were more lit than her people skills. Pictures came out great, but it wasn't cause of our photographer. The kids and I were prepped to really get results, and I just think another photographer would've lit this session on fire.

I walked in and was greeted buy a very kind employee. I explained that I was getting married in 25 days and wanted that ""bride glow"". We worked together and came up with the best option for me, she even found a way to save me money and I got everything I wanted.

They have vintage jewelry, china, silverware and a variety of antiques as well. Vintage Xmas ornaments? Got them. Vintage purses? Got them. Glassware of all eras and designs? Yep! 
One tip to this store is make sure you get to their basement. Items tend to be reduced or are garage sale finds that may not be that old but that are worth buying. I frequently find leather travel frames and interesting mirrors and boxes in the basement. Parking is plentiful with meters and there are other antique stores on both sides of the street."
Q-fNyVi4ZDz5jJkps8xYRw,iNwqk6U-uB2e9qTTH_SDvQ,"Best Chiropractor in AZ - I went in to see David with no issues as far as pain but wanted an assessment of my spine for overall wellness purposes.  Digital x-rays were taken and a curvature of my spine was apparent from slouching all the time.  David also noticed my left hip sat lower.  I was given a heel lift to put in my shoe.   This alone helped the knee pain I've been having while running for the last 24 years after a car accident when I shattered my femur.  Besides the normal adjustments, I was prescribed traction in the office to correct my misaligned spine.  David also gives instructions on how to properly carry oneself.   In addition, exercises are performed in David's office.  After seeing David 2x or 3x weekly for a month now, I feel like a new man.  I have more energy, my running is more efficient and I have a new outlook on life.  I thank David for his chiropractic services - he definitely goes above and beyond."

Luis is always there to help, has great ideas and is sure to let me know that he is the one who will be doing the lifting, not me.  They have literally bent over backwards for my company, including working on weekends to be sure we had our stuff together, going above and beyond what is required of them as a crate and freight service.

I found this place online which has a very professional website. They offer more than 1 location to do it at. When I spoke to the person on the phone they sounded knowledgeable and polite, took their time to explain and inform me about the procedure. When I went to the location it was run down and dirty. Looked like it hasn't been taken care in years. The person that did my procedure was apparently the owner and national trainer for the company. She gave me forms to fill out and as I was doing it I really had a feeling I should leave. We went into a room that looked like a run down back alley ghetto place and I thought she would have a proper mirror, lab coat etc. There was a bed, a plastic container with treys and no mirror. The persons name is Ms. Yvette and she isn't the most pleasant person. She appears stuck up and wants to get on with the business. I told her I was nervous and uneasy as I have never done this before and she said absolutely nothing to comfort me nor did she ask if she can help to explain anything. She said "" It looks like you don't trust me"". I stayed ""against my better judgement"". She put the anesthetic and I waited. She showed me that the needle she was using was in a package, thank God, then was testing colours for the eyebrows, but the room is so badly lit that she did it in front of the window asking me what looks good. How can you do a proper procedure with no proper light?She put on her thick glasses and started doing it. Once done she collected the money and gave me some handwritten piece of receipt with no name of the company on it or anything. I was still a bit shocked and left. They were too thick and too dark. She insisted that they only look black but are actually brown. Well I didn't go back for touch up because its a ghetto place that offers no customer service at all! My eyebrows were never brown and they turned grey so I have to fill them in, no choice. They are not even at the ends, one is thicker than the other. She claims she has been doing this since 2007 but the work doesn't show that. I hope to God that they start fading enough that I can get this done at a professional establishment with proper equipment and customer service. Don't be fooled by this $250 scam. Pay more but get it done by a professional. Do me a favor and go see the place first, talk to them in person and ask to see the rooms and equipment then make a decision."
bkjZjV8p260Bi8suTG-qJA,97gIl1_yJUNyw8YFFKRSPQ,This Sprint Store is WILD! I honestly don't know if it deserves a negative review because it's so entertaining but the customer service is absolutely terrible. I was here on a day when they had a lot of elderly couples in the store and they were blaring unedited Ludacris songs. Sprint does offer family plans but they do not offer a family friendly experience. If you are looking for something to tweet about or a funny store to tell your friends about then I highly recommend stopping by this store. If you are looking for a normal phone purchasing experience please go anywhere else. If you have any sort of hear condition do not stop by this store without consulting your doctor beforehand.

I love the fact that the the store is quite small and you have to dig through drawers and move aside a head in a jar; dig and you shall find!  The Vault never disappoints- all sorts of goodies up 75% off.

Whatever. My order was simple and still came out before theirs.

The food tastes fresh and is consistent with any other Arby's, although I don't frequent very often. I do enjoy their roast beef sandwiches and curly fries from time to time. Next time I'm not sure though if I'll pick this location..."

j9aqbEbdSw3JUDTAFKfNrw,4KbUaerUBoiUwZGMHKVFxQ,"New establishment in this area and the quality for the price you pay is not parallel. For under $6 you can walk out with something that looks so gourmet. The mutton biryani had a very distinct taste and so did the kothu roti.

High quality . Low price. You do the math for easy choice for Sri Lankan food!"
-cQ3qGfYZ9VCz7zloYN5mw,8raEqz3Z2V33ysFmFoN-Pg,"NOTE: This review is based on an eyebrow threading appointment only.

THE GOOD
- I came in late for my appointment and nobody seemed irritated (even though they were busy). I barely had to wait for the woman doing my eyebrows.
- The price was amazing. Being my first visit, the threading only cost me $9.
- The service was friendly and the place clean, albeit a bit confusing.

THE BAD
- I felt a little confused, being my first time getting threaded. She assumed I'd had it done before, rather than asking first, which made me feel a bit silly when she asked me to do things (i.e. hold my forehead and whatnot) and I had no idea what she wanted.
- This has been my only occasion getting threaded, so I don't know if this is normal, but my skin was pinched several times and the thread broke quite often throughout the process. It was unpleasant and honestly more irritating/painful than waxing.

THE UGLY
- Do they have air conditioning?! It wasn't particularly hot out, but being that they have tanning beds in this small salon, the place was HOT. I was sweating like crazy (attractive, I know) and felt pretty gross when I got up from the leather seat to leave.

BOTTOM LINE: I will not be coming back here again for threading, but only because of the threading. If their other services (tanning, waxing, etc.) are reasonably priced, I'd definitely check them out!"
-JXNpzCQdjHJgdBWkNWyUw,0hHSCU-9KLLfHckwqNBa0g,"Do not use this company !!!!! Completely incompetent . The instructor was smoking and cursing and not even paying attention while he took my daughter to a shady part of town to take her test . When I called the company to complain they acted stupid refused to acknowledge any wrong doing and hung up on me ! Very unprofessional !! 

Oh and when I first called they thought I was someone else calling to complain about  another incident ..... Wow!! do not let your child get in the car with these people

Apparently the owners don't care enough to read reviews thoroughly and if he didn't hang up on me he would know the issue. As you can see by his response below. My daughter is now 19 and this was when she was 15 , poor business dealings all around! His story doesn't even make sense "" I was working and needed their car"" but I was home with all the paperwork. Lies and not even relevant to the lewd behavior of the driver and himself. Move on to many other reputable companies when entrusting your child in a car"
O2EStAeAkTflmd4NMeculg,d7pI1lmIFqPqKWnpnVoaSw,Purchased a Pop up canopy for a Reg Charity last Spring . The tent was excellent quality. Colours Bright and the logo looked great. Initial contact was very prompt however once we paid and placed the order the service lagged. Canopy Quality was 5 stars but as mentioned by previous reviewers there was a definite lag in follow up emails and calls. If you want a prompt response do not expect it from here. If you don't mind delays then the good quality of their product makes up for it.

The spa in the middle looked a bit shady, but to my dismay it was a completely legitimate spa.

qJLxcfNPnla1RvipRLAonw,7pxXuhUdqwXf3I41Qw89gw,"Had our house painted in our new home in Phoenix about 2 months ago with Carrol's painting and had nothing but a great experience. First off, and my favorite part about working with this company, is the fact that EVERY time I called with questions, someone answered and addressed my concerns. They showed up on time for the estimate (which was reasonable) and also showed up on time each of the 3 days they were painting (they said max 4 days on the job, but completed it in 3, another bonus)

I highly recommend them if you are concerned about a bad job, or no contact, or dragging out the project, these guys are professional and responsive. The person who does the estimate is also the person overseeing your project so there is no mistake or confusion about what you paid to have done and what was actually completed (sometimes a big problem with contractors if you have a lot of experience using them)"

The entire experience was horrible. So bad, we left before we checked out. 

Personnel: Totally untrained, poorly dressed/sloppy, unhelpful as they we incapable of providing assistance. 

Product: A shock. The quality of the merchandise was substantially below anything I've seen in the USA. Perhaps par with a Dollar General store -- cheap junk. Much of the product has brand names I've never heard of. Perhaps Canadian. All substantially inferior to major USA brands which prevail at our stores. In many cases the packaging was filthy. Prices (converted), overpriced, plain and simple. Prices are about the same for substantially inferior product. 

Store Appearance: Filthy, poorly maintained. 

If this Walmart is the norm for Canada, you folks are getting royally screwed."

Free wifi too. We have finally found our family's trusted mechanics!"

It isn't cheap but you're paying for some unique high quality so I can't whine about the prices in the store. Last time I visited, I was lusting after these adorable sleepy stuffed animals and I was surprised when I got one as a gift during the visit to the store this trip (surprise gifts from your travel partner are always welcomed). I ended up with an adorable beaver made locally by Velvet Moustache. They also have a lot of nice postcards and frame worthy art. Huge selection that I am not doing justice to - you have to go in and prepare to spend at least 20 minutes browsing. The store is packed with cool items."

NhCc16EzL8LyR5va_pwfSA,vagYT2a2iTYnSkXKr93DSw,"Thank God for Amazon!  Do not give Stages your business. The grumpy guy who usually works there is so unreasonable that it's silly. 

I sent my 16-year-old guitar novice to buy a certain type of acoustic string. He specified a type of acoustic string and was told that they didn't carry the brand (which they actually had on the shelf at that time), and was then sold two different types of electric string.  It wasn't until I opened the bags that the packaging revealed that they were electric. I very calmly and politely described what had happened, and simply asked for them to be swapped for the type that he wanted in the first place, which was hanging on the shelf right behind him.  

An outsider might suggest that they took advantage of a kid who didn't know any better. But I didn't suggest that to the guy at the store.  I avoided the confrontation.  He just flat out refused and never once blinked.

The funny thing is that I recall being in there once before, and overheard him boasting to a customer about a very similar situation.  He had sold something defective or incorrect, and was clearly in the wrong, but refused correct / replace.  All for such minor stuff.  

My business won't make or break them, but I'm obviously not the first dissatisfied customer.  Amazon or Guitar Center from here on out."

FWkRdwpOV8gW3Z84q8HvBw,QCdfDJnBRUNtrfMpjFNZCQ,Planning my birthday party here with all my friends on Sat Nov 15th.  Heard great things about this place!

0qvy9G-gh2kqSzl9uKFe1w,opbIGwiOlaVdQSfIuXto-Q,"When we met with Christie for the first time, we were quite impressed with her presentation. We were informed that there may be an intern who would help out with the wedding, but Christie assured us she would also be there every step of the way. The first meeting we were supposed to have with Christie's intern, Stephanie was a no show. We were told that the intern would contact us, we waited a month - it never happened. This was an immediate turn off, but we figured that since Christie was still there to support us, we'd let it slide.
All vendors that Christie suggested to us in the meantime were way overpriced for our budget, and we were getting a bit discouraged; we were worried that our moderate budget just wasn't enough and this was my first experience planning or being part of a wedding, so I had no idea what was considered fair as far as pricing goes. This is what I thought we hired a wedding planner for, but we quickly learned that we had to go find our own vendors if we wanted anything close to decent in our price range. What was the point? Maybe day of services would have been a better choice for us.
The entire experience and overall sinking feeling we got with the entire planning part of the wedding was that CLM was completely useless unless we had endless amounts of money to spend and go way over budget.
Finally, we meet with Stephanie. She seems friendly, we like her. Next thing we hear is that Christie is completely having Stephanie take over the coordination for our entire wedding but she will still be available if we need anything. Not so much, we never heard from or saw Christie ever again, even though we tried calling and emailing her several times. When we asked Stephanie about it, she said Christie would give us a call and that never happened either.
Stephanie seemed to be very easy going when it came to the flexibility of our event, with the change of venue (due to a stretched budget) and constant changes to the guest list which were all out of our control. It was pretty chaotic at times but again, this is why we hired CLM. However, on the day of the event, our early arrival family members witnessed the venue director unprofessionally complaining with Stephanie about our wedding in the main dining area before my husband and I arrived for our ceremony and it was very clear that the complaining was not TO but WITH. Now, I realize I was not the one who witnessed this but I also know these multiple family members would never make something like that up. Even though Stephanie completely denied being a part of this conversation, we were not happy with the way she chose to (not) address the issue and Christie (surprise surprise) still has yet to even reply. As usual, I had to personally handle the issue myself with the CEO of the restaurant/venue.
Honestly, I think CLM may have once been a very nice wedding planning and coordination service and I don't know what happened in 2011 but this company has gone way downhill if what other reviewers claim is true. This was an awful experience and I would love nothing more than for Christie to take ownership of our bad experience but I have given up, based on her level of professionalism."

HIl_HyZTwCFPq3pwaFwnAg,A3z76dQhn38AgojmKWvkHQ,"If I could give less than 1 star, I would! As a licensed property management company, Todd Williams basically has a license to steal!! We leased a property managed by Cabellero for four years and were consistently told what great tenants we were - by Todd AND the property owner. YET when we moved out leaving the property SPOTLESS and in much better condition than when we moved in, he recommended that the owner withhold $500 of our $1700 deposit with a three word  explanation '""lack of care!"" The notice included no proof, receipts or detail! They simply withheld our money because they could!! I'm a real estate broker so I know the courts make it hard for a tenant to fight back and Todd knows that too so I imagine he withholds from every tenant!! What a racket!  The property owner SLAMMED Todd and his company the last couple weeks saying he and his company were horrible (I'm sugarcoating her words) and yet she agreed with his arbitrary theft of our money. She turned out to be as greedy as Todd! We marked the broken floor tiles from the foundation problem like she asked, we paid to have the carpets cleaned (which she then ripped out), we had the house professionally cleaned and we had the lawn professionally manicured! Todd stood me up the morning of our walk through so I was not there to defend when he did it. They had NO REASON to keep our money!! The law allows it so they do it. No matter who manages your rental, TAKE A VIDEO WHEN YOU MOVE IN AND ANOTHER WHEN YOU MOVE OUT TO PROTECT YOURSELF FROM LICENSED THIEVES!!!!"

8ztbiTDIi-2yQLVul58c5w,7WR0Purd16nKyIrG9o00Yg,"I really wanted to like this place, therefore I tried it twice before writing this review.  First the good points.  The restaurant is small but it is extremely clean and inviting with two flat screen televisions.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. Also I have not tried the subs, therefore since subs are their primary food, I give two stars with some reservations but the thing that made me try Doughbelly's is the television commercial that advertised their ""delicious"" Fried Chicken special.  I want Fried Chicken to be hot.  I don't want chicken that appears to have been cooked yesterday and that is exactly how the chicken tasted.  I could have gotten better chicken from out of a box in Walmart's frozen section.  I could tell that it would have been delicious if they would fry to order but I was in and out in about 6 minutes with my hard, tasteless chicken special in hand.  This place was empty both times that I went there, absolutely no other patrons.  IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN BUSINESS .  1.  Change your name  2.  Cook the food to order including frying the chicken after the order is placed.  People will wait for good food.  3.  Have two or three flavors of chicken i.e. mild, extra hot and Cajun.  Do something different.  No one will come unless you do something unique.  I'm so sorry but  I will not be back unless the suggestions above are implemented however, I do wish you success and hope that you stay in business.  Good Luck."
kx9lPUfVX7-oogC_cbQpgA,YVaONBBT9lSJQwBPWCB0qQ,"Location: Off the main strip in St. Sauveur. They have a large parking area that is shared with other shops. 

The store: Until recently, this used to be a Loblaws that left me feeling uninspired with all of its yellow No Name crap littering the shelves. There was absolutely nothing noteworthy about the place UNTIL.... the Provigo chain switched it into a big-ass Provigo. The entire store has undergone a major facelift and I was stunned when I walked in because the place looks classy! I mean, as classy as a grocery store can be. It's incredibly spacious and very well lit. Despite its size, you kinda feel all warm and cozy as you leisurely stroll down the aisles. 

Stuff: The first thing I'm going to tell you that you should remember is that they carry Point G macarons. These are my FAVORITE macarons EVER and as far as I know, no other grocery store carries them. The macarons are conveniently located in the bakery section (of course), which is conveniently located right at the front of the store so when you walk in, you are ASSAULTED by the display's gravitational pull and thus, can do nothing but watch helplessly as your feet guide you toward all of those baked goods. The cupcakes, the chocolate, the cakes - GOOD GOD. But I digress. They also have a great selection of fruits and veggies, fish, dairy - all of the stuff you need to make a spectacular meal. In addition, they have a very good organic section where you can also find vitamins and supplements.  If I was going to choose one grocery store to shop at in St. Sauveur, it would be Provigo. I hate grocery shopping and I love this place. 

Bonus: They have a Joe Fresh section at the back of the store. It's not a boutique so selection is limited, but if you forgot your yoga pants at home, need a PJ or  a sweater to keep you warm on the ski hills, you can get something for cheap right here. 

Price: It really depends on what you're buying. They have some pretty decent sales but the fact of the matter is that almost all grocery stores up this way are going to be more expensive than they are in town. While they all cater to the locals, they also cater to a very high tourist population, hence, the price hike."

Until Drummer I would have categorized every property manager as falling into one of four categories; crooks, drunks, lazy or incompetent. Sometimes more than one. 

As the other reviews will atest, being a property manager is sometimes a difficult business with the property manager often taking the blame for absent owners. In contrast to the other property managers we have dealt with, Drummer, has always been proactive, responsive and diligent. In a word, professional. Our tenants have similarly satisfied whenever issues like a broken hot water heater or a plugged drain have come up. They have been responsive, efficient and courteous."

They're my go-to shop for bday gifts and stocking stuffers.  Complimentary wrapping, annual $5.00 off birthday cards mailed to your child, and monthly in-store activities are icing on the cake.

I went to see her an just rude from day 1. I always walked out her office feeling like a fat POS even though i had lost 63 pounds an by 4 months prego had not gained a pound. I was supposed to find out the sex of my baby june 9 after work. Went to work and my co worker was driving that day an ran a red light an t-boned a car going opposite direction. I thought i was hving a miscarriage as the car impacted on my side of car. I went to Banner thunderbird and Kwark came after the other doctors had checked and said i was okay. They were going to do ultrasound to be sure baby  was okay. Kwark came in hospital before the ultrasound and told me the sex of the baby was not important. It was important to us. Plus they already told me he was fine. Thankfully the hospital told us sex at ultrasound or we would not hv known till delivery no thanks to kwark.. I told Kwark i wasn't doing diabetes testing,long story but i was eating right ext. Kwark ordered tests for another reason but threw on it diabetes testing as well without my ok. She told my children i am stubborn because i dnt agree with everything a money hungry doctor says. I told her i didn't want to be induced. All of a sudden my blood pressure was a lil high 2 times so she induced  when 37 weeks an 5 days. When i got to hospital for inducing the nurses said are you sure theres no mistake because i was perfectly normal an EVERYTHING looked great. I told Kwark threw whole pregnancy i want my tubes tide. Signed the 30 day paper and all. I had him in September an is now end of January. I went to see about tubes tide 8 weeks after delivery and i was asking questions about different ways to get them tied.i was apparently taking to long as she went out room to get a pamphlet i heard her say is she kidding. Ultimately she told me i want more kids and won't tie my tubes the old way, not this new way with dye. Do not waste your time unless you want to feel like a worthless person every time you step out her office. Not to mention the ladies who set up your next appointment are rude as well. Steer clear of this place. You ask kwark one thing and she does another. Wish I could have had a better experience but it just wasn't. Thankfully I found a OBGYN that is just lovely! To bad I found her after all my pregnancies but she took care of everything Kwark wouldn't."
SsxIZZtR_fgw5eyGquRvig,oQKQM1Ag7b_Oc89Sny-Nrw,"Opening Day of this brand-new farmers' market in the SUSD parking lot, on 44th street by the side-entrance to Arcadia High School, was so much fun. Great crowd turn-out and a nice selection of vendors. The three ladies who organized the market were super nice. 

I got cookies from La Grande Orange's booth, fresh juice from S.E.E.D cafe, the best beauty products my skin has ever come in contact with from Flora Apothecary and a pot roast from a rancher (I forget his name). I did a ton more shopping while my kids played. The market give a percentage (not sure how much) of their proceeds to all the schools in the neighborhood, so that's pretty neat-o. 

Check it out- just go early because I got a bit toasty! Hooray for a Farmers' market in my 'hood!!"
rzcCrNNqpPYhMSOVfpYezw,pJYRi9MB06aiuL-w8Ms-Og,"This affordable supper hilly city owned par 3 pitch'n putt course is located right outside the Victoria Park subway station.  

For seasoned golfers, it is a good opportunity to work on the short game and some putting (the worst part of my game).  The majority of the holes are under 120 yards with two holes over 150 (hole #6 @ 169 & #11 @185).  One of my plans is one day play a whole round here with just two clubs, my PW and a putter.  Even though it's very short, it's still quite challenging and there are a lot of elevated tees.  

The turf mats on a few holes are extremely annoying, but it is what it is.

If you're new to golf, Dentonia is pretty much the only place to start in the city.  There are much better and easier par 3 executive courses to start your first ever round of golf, but they're outside of the TTC range.

If you're new to golf, I recommend getting some lessons at Beach Fairway a block south, get on the driving range there, then head up here and see how you do.  Probably not all in the same day though.

It's $25 regularly, and $19 during twilight hours, which makes this the most affordable place to golf in the city limits."

I met Amber today who is the owner and she is not only fair with prices and purchasing items but she takes the time to talk to you so she knows what your looking for as to see if she can help. She's just overly friendly but not to the point where your annoyed either!! I'm so pleased with the outfits I purchase which ALL were in excellent condition and priced very reasonably! The downside is you have to use your store credit same day HOWEVER Amber makes that SUPER FAIR as well!! She gives you more cash because she said she understands that can be a pain!! I'm so impressed I HAD to write a glowing review !!! Sure, there are other places however, I've not been to one like this; where you feel at home, like your simply searching through your girlfriends closet! Awesome! A+ all around!!!"

W7BiJB9c2e_qz-fQLR_yMw,hoCTR-aiEcRJT8asMVKu0w,"Ugh... This was a pretty disappointing place.

I had a little problem with the Night Splash deal, which is basically admission for nighttime hours at a discounted price. The website says that the Night Splash tickets go on sale at the gate at 6:00PM, so I buy the tickets online earlier in the day, show up to the park at about 6 with my girlfriend and her 8 year-old kid, and they make us stand outside the gate for an hour in the 100+ heat because the Night Splash apparently doesn't start until 7:00PM. I think this place could use an adult presence. None of the employees had any customer skills and when they had 20 different pissed off parties of people who bought tickets online and apparently showed up too early, they still didn't seem to want to admit any problem. But that's what happens when even the senior employees aren't old enough to buy a beer.

Aside from that, the lines for the slides were pretty long and they don't really move people through with any efficiency. They seem to not just wait for the previous person to get out of the pool below the slide, but then clear some painted red line on the concrete before they send the next person down. What the crap? I've been to other waterparks where they just count to 5 or 10 and it seems to work fine. I don't think I could tolerate this place during daytime summer hours.

The whole facility is actually fairly nice and this place would be pretty cool if it was managed better, but for my money, I'll go to the Hilton resort by Squaw Peak. Not only is the staff more service oriented there, but you can also sip on a cocktail while you float around their lazy river tube ride."

sLOuVlFXdefItC3yMJ2ttg,sgOon7bgsvGR3RQZYkEQpQ,"I really liked this urgent care for several reasons. 

First, I called ahead to ensure they accepted my insurance, and the guy at the front desk was SUPER helpful and very pleasant to speak with, explaining to me that they do take it and going into detail about the specific plan I have (it's a plan under Tricare and UnitedHealth) and why some people do not accept it because it used to be called a different name. Anyways, he really seemed to know his stuff and was happy to inform me of all this. When I did arrive, he remembered this and made sure that everything would be okay insurance wise, and that I would not be saddled with a huge bill due to miscommunication. 

Second, the wait time was outstanding in that there was basically none at all. I was in and out of this place within about fifteen minutes. When you're not feeling well and just want to go home and lay down, being efficient and speedy is a huge plus. 

Lastly, the doctor (her name was Rosa Banuelos, MD) really listened to me and my concerns, especially when I told her that the antibiotic that she originally wanted to prescribe was one that has never worked for me. Sometimes doctors will think they know you best and will prescribe something anyways, not listening to what you have to say. She asked why it didn't work and together we came up with a better solution for me, which meant an alternate antibiotic, which of course I was very pleased with. She's a sweet lady too, so her demeanor also put me at ease. 

I'll definitely be visiting again when I do get sick in the future."

I felt so much better after my massage and look forward to my next appointment."
HkwL8meWL2N81C33Ex2Sug,mxbfK41rL8K1jkY8s7NB5A,"About a year ago I found Karen after doing some research online. After 3 years of struggling with my diet after being diagnosed as Celiac, I finally asked for help. Initially, I sought help because I was frustrated by weight gain after following a Celiac-friendly diet. I signed up for three sessions as part of a weight loss program. 

After my first appointment, Karen recommended food sensitivity testing and I was surprised to find that there were many, many foods that were causing problems. According to Karen, eliminating these foods would lead to many improvements. Karen told me that many things would change. She told me not to expect overnight results. This was not a quick fix. I could expect things like clearer skin, reduced sinus inflammation, better sleep, improved brain function, reduced muscle pain, more energy, and weight loss. She said inflammation would be reduced before weight loss and that people would notice that first. I admit that I was skeptical at first. It all sounded too good to be true. But I trusted in her method. 

My initial 3 weight loss sessions came and went without the desired weight loss that I had anticipated. However, the ultimate goal Karen had in mind was making my body work properly, not lose weight. The weight loss would come, I was assured. Although eliminating foods was trying and difficult at times, I trusted that she was in the right track. Instead, we focused on other victories, like reducing inflammation, and improving bathroom habits, as well as a general feeling of wellness. After 9 months, I was retested for food sensitivities and had far less progress with the responses than Karen expected. Still, she did not give up. We pressed on and added supplements, and altered some of the ways I was preparing foods. It worked. 

It has been almost a year to the day since my first visit with Karen. In the last year, EVERYTHING that Karen said during our first visit happened! Sometimes so slowly that I barely noticed. Initially, it was reduced inflammation and very little weight loss. However, as Karen had told me, the weight came off. Looking back, it is amazing how far I've come. I have lost 50 lbs. in as many weeks. After years of inflammation causing me to look ""puffy"" I am amazed when I look in the mirror. As she had said, my skin was clearer, and my inflammation was reduced significantly. I sleep more soundly and do not feel tired when I wake up anymore. I used to have coffee each morning to help me wake up but I no longer feel like it is necessary. I feel happier, clearer and more energized mentally. What I had attributed to ""mommy fog"" was actually fixed by changing the foods I ate. 

If you are truly ready for a change, Karen has an amazing background of expertise to help. She stays current on new research and is not afraid to adjust a plan to get results. She truly changed my life and for the first time ever, I am back in control. 

I am not saying this process was easy or that it was quick, but it is definitely worth doing if you are ready to take responsibility for your health and follow her recommendations. I am glad that I did."

The service level of the sales associate, Melanie, was top notch as she helped me locate the exact item I was in search of. I was impressed by the entire line of products and their commitment to provide cruelty free and organic skincare products. I think I may have to start treating myself to this luxurious store more often. The reviews of all of their products on Sephora, Nordstroms and other websites speak volumes especially about the Immortelle brand.

9cuY7i9xgPlk1Q8jHVmaYg,dNvRUCGX1ln5vBOG-L8kIA,"I have worked with Greg Land at CornerStone Inspections on several home inspections (1998) and again in (2011).  In my first transaction with him, his thorough and professional inspection helped me analyze a home and saved me from making what could have been a very expensive error in home purchase. I will always be grateful and I would absolutely never use anyone but CornerStone again. He is honest and incredibly thorough - far exceeding details I'd had available to me in any prior home inspection. Greg and the other members of his family-owned business are committed to excellence which these days is often hard to find.  He is punctual, straightforward, honest, thorough, deeply knowledgeable and highly professional. His material report is easy to understand as a lay person and very helpful in learning about the house or building. Greg and Liz and team go the extra mile. On one occasion a year after I purchased my current home I called for advice and he called me back on a vacation day on his way to Flagstaff. I was again so grateful and so impressed. This team is absolutely the BEST! I highly recommend.

(By the way - having read the one negative review here on Yelp I can't help but wonder if this reviewer confused the name of the company she intended to review. I am not aware of anyone named Tom on their team and furthermore nothing about the review matches my many interactions with CornerStone.)"

When we decided to hire a post-partum doula pretty much at the last minute, Lisa went above and beyond to find us one, and we were absolutely thrilled with Heather (understatement of the year). Heather made my maternity leave and post-partum adjustment period one of the most wonderful and memorable times in my life that I will cherish for years to come. Heather is an extremely sensitive and caring individual who tuned into our family's needs, and went above and beyond to nurture us. Heather's love and care enabled me to truly focus on bonding with the little one, while healing and staying relaxed through what can often times be a stressful adjustment for the family.

GHiOyoraXP9k4lU9V_GsZA,WL_U3MBUfTkeHL9lYxoleg,"The Cabinet of Curiosities.... holy crap. This place has got to be one of the best vintage shops in Cleveland. And I bet you've never even heard of it. Don't feel bad. Try to ignore my snobby attitude -- I hadn't heard of it either until this past weekend when I accidentally stumbled into it. They've been open for about a year now and I'm hoping to tell all of Cleveland about them so that they will STAY open.

Have you ever seen the Discovery Science television show ""Oddities""? If not, it's about this little antique shop in NYC called Obscura. Any-damn-way, my point is that The Cabinet of Curiosities has lots of the same types of things that you'd find at Obscura. The adorable shop owner told me he bought something he saw on the show and this item is now for sale in his shop -- it was some sort of ocular device (read: torture) used by ophthalmologists back in the day.  

If you still have no idea what I'm talking about.... this shop has some really cool shit. Things you would possibly find at the Mutter Museum in Philly. Or just random things you would find at other vintage shops like antique perfume bottles and the occasional rare kitchen item. But the best example of the items you can find here are creepy old dolls with cracked faces (they have quite a collection!), mounted insect collections, random vintage musical instruments (I saw a sitar in there), plenty of religious relics, old photographs, and zombie dolls/stuffed animals that were made by one of the owners or various artists who may consign there. 

Basically, this shop is KICK ASS and I want you to go there NOW and support this business so that they stay afloat and continue to bring awesome and rare vintage finds for me to ogle and possibly buy!!  OKAY?!"

1z9QNdEvLKe7QDChmCJdvQ,JFdiSXK2ktDPeSY0A4F3SQ,"My first time coming here and I was very disappointed. And if I can say one thing that should stick in peoples minds, is to never come here.

I first called in to make an appointment for 1245pm on a Saturday. Unfortunately they did not have the time that I needed and I was okay with that. They called me back and said someone had canceled and that they were able to take me but at 1230pm instead. I said it was fine and told them I would be on the way. 

I arrived at 1230pm at the salon, my first impressions of it were very negative. The place was not busy (which wasn't the issue) but it had an eerie feeling about it and the vibe that I was getting wasn't positive. I had a nail design that I showed them before they started on me to see if they were able to accommodate me and they said yes right away. All I wanted were nails that were white but that had had glitter on top of them. 

The two ladies that were there were both busy with other clients and made me wait till 1250pm to start on me. Mind you that they told me to come in at 1230pm. One lady came by and started to coat my nails. She then said, show me the picture again. So I showed it to her and she had this look on her face (through her mask) as if she was annoyed and right then I knew she would try to convince me that I would not have time or  that it was too difficult to do. I don't know what the reason why but she just acted and looked like she did not want to do my nails the way I wanted them to do it. At that point, I felt obligated to get my nails done because they already cleaned my nails and put the base coat on .I offered her an alternative (I don't know why I did that) for french manicure instead and so she obliged. 

Throughout the whole entire process, she did not speak to me or ask me any questions. She had a really negative and rude vibe that I wasn't feeling. Not only that, the place was just really gross, it looked like it was not clean or they clean as little as possible. I wasn't comfortable, I was annoyed and wasn't happy that I had to wait as I was doing my nails during my lunch hour. 

The quality of my nails weren't the greatest either. If you look from afar they look even and polished. However, if you girls / guys are like me and always want your nails to be perfect ( in your eyes and your opinion), it was far from perfect. The french tips were uneven for each finger and the coating was crap. She only did one coat for the french tip and part of my base nail was showing. 

So would I recommend this place to the girls who love to get their nails done?
Absolutely not."

I'm not sure this place typically sells direct to the public. The employee asked me what plumbing company I worked for. When I ""revealed"" that I was a DIY'er he assigned the purchase to plumbing company company and then I paid cash.  No big deal I guess - not planning on returning an anode rod..."

See, I have been searching for the new denim high tops that I saw in Elle magazine about a month ago.  No one in the Milwaukee area sells them and I cannot find them online.  To my delight they had the shoes here!  I searched for a sales person, and when I found him he went to the back to find my size and looked at me strangely when I told him how difficult these were to find back home.  He came back telling me they didn't have any even close to my size but he could order them and ship them to my house!  ""Yes!  Great!  Thanks!"" I exclaimed.  So again he disappeared to the back.  About 5 minutes later he came back saying he was so sorry but these shoes are almost completly sold out worldwide and that would be why I cannot find him and he cannot order them.  Damn.  He told me he'd let the district manager know tomorrow when she comes in and I could call back in about a month to see if they will add them to their permanent collection and carry them again.  Boo hoo.  

I sadly left but noticed the amazing chandelier on the ceiling.  It was an amusing blend of all things Vegas; glitter, playing carks, poker chips, etc.  Very cool!"

Sounds awesome if you look at their website and interactive map and a preview of all the thrill rides.  The landscaping looks to be much better too.  It's about time the hottest, fastest-growing and fifth largest city in the nation had an A-List theme park when SoCal has about ten alone!  When I see the Travel Chanel's ""Top Ten U.S. Water Parks"" they blow all of ours away.  I hope they re-engineer the wave pool with rolling waves, so that you can ride them like at Big Surf, instead of the intermittent ""undulation"" it had here before and at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa.

Went with a group of colleagues and despite being one of the only parties there the service was bad.  

We had bruschetta that was too dry, and I had the worst gnocchi I have ever tasted.  The portions also seemed quite small

It took them 15 minutes to clear our plates when we had finished our appetizer, and the waiter had the nerve to assume I would tip 15% on the total bill.

I would not recommend this restaurant."

I purchased my washer / dryer from these guys 20 years ago when they had one location down south.  Excellent customer service, very happy.  And 20 years worth of wear on the pair, cannot ask for any more than that.

Recently went to the NE location to look at a replacement for my GE pair that just can't do the job anymore.  
#1 - there were about 5 salespeople, but they were all on the phone.  So, I went to the counter and asked if I could get some help.  One guy finally peeled the phone away from his ear and asked what I wanted, kind of rudely too.  Sorry to interrrup your 1-900 phone call.
#2 - I actually did some research and knew the pair I wanted.  Samsung for about $1800 for the pair.  Salesmen Dicky didn't even look towards the appliances and said they were out of stock.  
#3 - I went out the door and drove to Coast Appliances and purchased the pair for $1600.  Excellent service, great salespeople.

For what's it's worth - here is the blessing on this story.  I went onto the BBB Calgary website, and apparently dodged a bullet as this location of Trail Appliances is notorious for bad customer service and delivering faulty / defective merchandise.  So, all in all, I was happy to NOT do business with them in the end."

Naturally I returned the next day. All the items are beautiful. They seem to be handmade/imported from Morocco, so they are a bit pricey.

I walked away with a few keychains that were $10 each, a coin bag for $15, and a small backpack for $100.

I loved it, it was just very pricey. But I understand that it's the cost of having beautiful handmade items."

They are very reasonable on cost, but unfortunately, habitually ignore calls and emails.  I've inquired about a refile of a previous years tax returns about a dozen times (literally) to various staff members including Monica, Aaron and others to no avail.  It's a very simple and quick process to accomplish since they already have all of my info in the computer, but they simply refuse to respond.  It's too bad - I generally find them all to be pleasant and competent.  But when a business (at all levels of the organization) does not prioritize responsiveness to its customers, it's hard to continue a relationship.  It's just a cultural flaw over there I guess.

But it was really nice.  

They helped out a lot.  Everything was pre-purchased and whatnot, so it was very easy... just had to pay the pastor to come in and speak at the memorial.

So... what I wanted to say about this place that's really neat, is that you can now have something to do with the cremains that's personalized.  

They have a room, attached to the building, where they have a bunch of shelved glass units, separated into different sizes, from floor to about ceiling.  The room is almost all glass, so the sun lights it nicely.

Anyway... so you purchase one of these units by size and you can put the cremains in there of your loved one and put anything else in there that they were fond of in their life.

For example, for my grandpa, there will likely be something with trains, golf, accounting (yes, he loved accounting), and the grandkids.

It's really neat.  I had never been one to consider something like that for myself in the future, but seeing that... I really like it.  It's much better than a headstone or something like that."

We sat down and chatted for 20 minutes about my finances and my needs. He then showed me a used Toyota that was exactly what what I needed. I bought the first car that Mark showed me. 

After I settled on the car, I was nervous that I would not be able to get financing because of my bad credit. Mark sent me to see Steward who worked with me to find the right plan. Later, Steward took the time to explain my credit history and gave me some valuable financial advice that was unrelated to the car. He really understands finance.

Overall, everyone at Erinwood Ford went out of their way to make me feel special even though I was only buying a $5500 car. I definitely will be coming back."

I got connected with Bob Duguid, who along with the rest of the experienced AutoPark Mississauga team gave me five-star service from the moment I walked in the door to the test drives, all through the sales process. They made the purchase of the loaded 2015 Dodge Grand Caravan Crew Plus that I ended up buying very easy (which is, of course, their job), and financing it was a snap. 

I picked it up about three months ago, after almost 10,000 KMS of driving, including two long family road trips to the southern and eastern US, it's been as trouble-free as advertised. 

I do not hesitate to recommend this team if you are in the market for a vehicle, though in retrospect, I could have done a better job of negotiating the purchase price of the vehicle."

The appointments are hard to get, 2-3 weeks out. 
They do not listen, I had requested each time to not put the ugly bows on my dogs head/neck and each time I have to hold down my dog when I get home to take them off, sometimes even requiring me to cut them out when they got tangled in her hair. 
The owner (wife?) cut my dogs nails making it bleed, wrapped it in a bandage which fell out in the car getting blood all over my car seat."
9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA,zi9fGHuzhehTaLvcLxd9Lw,"Used Tom Trucker (based on the Yelp recommedations) to move from Bathurst & Claxton to Bathurst & Lakeshore, a few kilometers away  on March 1, 2011.

Pros: Very pleasant service on the phone.  Showed up on time.  Wrapped large furniture in saran wrap like plastic.  Disassembled bed, and assembled again.

Cons: Showed up with three movers although we only asked for two and then said three would cost $110 an hour and get the job done faster.  The move took 4.5 hours with three workers moving a 1bdrm apartment with no dining room into a 2 bdrm condo.  They got lost and did not call our cell phone, and therefore wasted 30 minutes of our time (which we had to still pay for).  Broke our mirror even though they wrapped it.  Dirtied our couch and mattress, even though they were wrapped, by dragging them on the ground.  One of the workers talked incessantly, argued with the others and used our bathrooms repeatedly (about 10 times - we kid you not).  The others took several smoke breaks.

So even though they had 3 workers, one to load and unload, and two to carry, we basically only saw one toilet using dude dragging and bringing in our stuff.   Probably because they simply did not get along.  We had also moved all of our clothing and and several car loads of items out ourselves the previous day to make it easier for the movers.

Completely not worth it, and we would NEVER use or recommend this company to anyone else."

LCaX2PyWukPEvPpPU5wkLw,9W73B44Iw8WslrTNB2CdCg,"This is the only library I've been to outside the downtown core and it was actually delivers on all fronts a library should deliver on. It certainly helps that it's part of a library system that has a capacious collection so that you have the option to peruse through multiple branches. Of course this is true of any regional library but it is a serious plus that they offer us. 
For some of the hot titles right now such as the Steve Jobs bio, A Dance With Dragons and The Hunger Games series which I'm listening to at the moment almost every copy was out except for 1 or 2 copies of the latter 2 series in other branches. staff are helpful behind the various info desks, they have a good sized quiet study space, lots of study tables (especially on the second floor) and ample computer terminals and everything has always been in working order each time I've been there. 

Their hours are not the greatest, especially on weekends so that's a bit of a downer but overall they seem to be a great community center, across the parking lot for the ever expanding Bramalea City Centre. 

This branch is only an average 3 star location because despite it's great location it doesn't have anything that makes itself stand out as a location that I can see myself spending a day studying/reading at. Maybe a bit more accessible features for laptops (aka power outlets) can help?

I'm always a fan of the library systems and I still see it as a ""too good to be true"" kind of deal especially with them carrying DVDs, Audiobook CDs and e-books. However while this is a reflection of the overall Brampton Library system rather than this specific branch I think they still do have room to play around with the potential the new mobile digital world has to offer to libraries."

I was so turned off by the Dr.  I get that not everyone approves of CrossFit but the Dr's attitude toward my injuries and condescending nature was not a good selling point.  Telling me not to work out as much as I do is also not the answer.  The video that they make you watch of testimonials is absurd.

Probably the worst acrylic nails I've ever had. The nail she repaired fell off a week later, and the polish was so thick that it started peeling off as well. The reason I'm even leaving a review is because it cost $60 for a fill and gel polish; more than I've ever paid for those services in my life. I would never go back and I would never pay those prices ever again, it's ridiculous. This place isn't worth the price they're trying to charge.

2qbqrNLv8HTd3EVTUGoS7g,drHg2_DR1RNA0tlpepXOtg,"I bought a controller here in October and got 3-4 day shipping. One thing I dislike is they wait until after you purchase the controller to tell you that it will take 5-8 days to make the controller, THEN your shipping method of 3-4 days to get to you. I wouldn't have paid extra for fast shipping if I had known it wouldn't make it on time for my SO's birthday.

Other than that, the controller was of great quality when I received it. Everything was the correct color and just the way I customized it. One thing that bothered me was that I ordered the bullet buttons for the controller. 3 bullets were the same and had gold centers. The 4th one was a different brand bullet than the rest so its center was silver and not gold like the rest of them. When you want stuff to match, this can be bothersome but my SO and I decided not to bother to get it fixed and just figured it gives it character. Less likely anyone has the same controller that way.

I am still going to order from them again in the future, but I will not pay extra for fast shipping, and I will not order anything that could possibly have different colors that won't match."

However, what ruined the experience was the subsequent service.  I wanted to return the purchase but didn't know the return policy, so I called to check before I make half hour trip.  I specifically asked if cash refunds are given and was told yes.  I asked again to be sure - and sales clerk confirmed yes.

I made the half hour trip.  And was told I can refund but in merchandise only.  I was puzzled because this is not what I was told on the phone.  The sales manager said that that's how they were trained to answer and she did not know the difference when explaining cash and merchandise refund.  It is a shame that somebody would use that excuse and be so insensitive of customer's time."

Their teriyaki sauce is too watered down for me so I usually buy a bottle of the real stuff and add it myself.  Staff are very efficient.

It is quiet and clean and a perfect size. Noise from neighbors can only be heard in the hallway and after the door is closed, the apartment is basically sound proof. I totally recommend Sauk creek to anyone!"

Not only do they offer great prices and solid work, but when I totaled my car 4 days after having some major maintenance done, they spoke to the insurance adjuster with me and made sure he was aware of how much money I spent on the car just the week before! They actually helped me get all the money I spent on maintenance back through my insurance claim! You can't beat that kind of service!!"

The staff was extremely disrespectful to customers simply because we asked for a large cup of water. How broke can you be to supply a 2cent cup of FREE WATER. The manager insisted this was mcdonalds policy however every other mcdonalds In the province would satisfy the customer. 2 minutes later we drove to the next closest mcdonalds and they gave us a large water with no questions asked! This location has Rude disgusting customer service. Save your time and go somewhere else!

This is probably a good location for children. First, they can run off some of their stored energy by trying to 'be first' on area trails. The visitor center has displays, including information on invasive species, but the kids will like the animals. There is a snake and turtle on display. There are also bird feeders that attract local feathered animals from the woods. I think they had a coloring book activity. Along the paths you may happen on a heron or some loitering geese.

There are functional public restrooms.

The trails are steep. The visitor center looks wheelchair accessible."

And EVERY table is cleared out of all Christmas merchandise!! They had boxes everywhere on the ground and people walking around them and it looked like Christmas was over! There is still a few more shopping days if I'm not mistaken but they were Done with Christmas mode! I heard someone ask if the store was going out of business?? I was shocked, I couldn't find a gift package at all !! I asked what appeared to be the Manager why everything was gone and her response was 
""No other time to do this and I'm NOT doing it Christmas Eve""!!! I ended up buying a candle which was not what I went in for but Holiday stuff was nowhere to be found! I paid for it and wasn't even given holiday wrapping, I had to ask for it! Just a joke! Turning tables and merchandise should be done after hours not during peak shopping days !! 
Won't be shopping there anymore!!"

I said I wanted it to hang over and grow out I did NOT say I wanted it faded there. Not once. It's like she doesn't understand English. I'm going to a legit barber who knows wtf they're doing next time. If you do go here you might have to talk to them like children.

y_Haa3kEddcox6R78o12pQ,1SEwOEWqJsJGBR1NYKC5uA,"Store manager Christina is incredibly rude. In my 30 minutes there, she swore at a customer, got in several arguments (shocking how much she likes confrontation), accused a customer of stealing which was completely baseless and when that person was being defended by another customer, she became overtly racist. If you are of darker complexion, you are a thief as per her.  When the customers left, she went on to disparage them with staff and customers for quite some time. It was loud, obnoxious, and disgusting. I am surprised how someone so terrible at her job became the store manager. A lot of items don't have prices so good luck getting a fair price from her. Even things which do have prices, she will arbitrarily change them if she feels you are getting a deal. This is what happens when an insecure person feels they are the king. This store left such a bad taste that it makes me reconsider our family donations with SA."

Now, I can definitely understand being a lazy business owner with a captive audience in a tourist trap, and not wanting to make more money by serving more people. More power to you and your comfort taking precedence over money. Seriously. Good for you! But, don't be rude about it. Fake a smile. maybe throw in a ""desole"" or something. Avoid this place."

Taste is really good authentic Jamaican and when locals and Jamaicans flock this restaurant you know its good.  

My only qualm is the kiddy portion; note that I am a frequent customer of lunch specials and I know what a 'lunch special' portion should be like. I had to eat a ratio of one 'meat' to three scoops of rice.

Maybe I just got the 'lucky' portion but that is one wasted pilgrimage."

an-iqcJVeX8zfEHMc_Zy0g,Rp-cSUHm-EKBxgBS73PNNg,"I don't understand why on their website it clearly states under ""consultation"" the following: ""...you will have a consultation with Dr. Derek Chow to discuss your health-related problems, concerns, and potential treatment options. This initial visit is designed for Dr. Derek Chow to learn more about you, your condition, and  expectations to determine how chiropractic care can meet your goals.""  To my surprise they simply just told me Dr. Chow only meets the patients if your injury is sports related. Really?!  I felt that this is misleading because the number one reason I gave this place a try was because I thought I was going to be assessed by the doctor himself. 

Secondly, the straw that broke the camel's back was their scheduling.  I was there on a Friday and I booked a second visit for the following Friday. My injury is due to postpartum baby care pains and so I had to make alternative arrangements for a babysitter to babysit my newborn in order to attend my next session.  They called me 2 days before saying they aren't able to see me anymore Friday because there was a scheduling error.  This had caused me $45 to cancel with my babysitting service less than 3 days in advance.  

Friday comes, receptionist called me but I missed their call and she left me a voicemail at 5:30pm asking if I was still going to go in for my 5pm appointment?!?  I don't get it, why call to ask me that when you cancelled?

I would not recommend this business."

FWHM-XazgsVVLSGbnva0qA,aBH88pGiH9nlE2b1y3xBBA,"We had an awfully horrible experience with a new AC install several years ago (see Cool Breeze review....and listen to me throw angry punches in the air). Luckily we found Blake, owner of Peavler, a few years back, and he helped nurse the sad system along until recently when it up and vomited in the yard. One unit was 'stick a fork in it' dead. Instead of throwing anymore $$ at this cursed sad system, we had Blake rip out everything. I burned a few smudge sticks and had a priest perform the exorcism after the removal. Blake knew my wife was picky, but I was pretty sure not to the degree - if the woman got sent to Hell and someone found a nice comfy chair for her to sit in, brought a table over, poured a tall glass of cool water, and pointed a fan in her general direction, she would be pissed there was no lemon slice in her glass. Ha! I thought, Blake you are in for a treat. Little did I realize the man is cut from the same cloth. He gave her a hard hat and called her 'The Inspector'. What they installed was a thing of beauty. I started getting an ulcer thinking about the size of the bill. The Inspector was asking for (and getting) all sorts of extras. A two day job turned into 4 days. In the garage they even sheet rocked around the metal return air drop vents (Blake's idea). And get this, they even moved the concrete slab away from the house to provide better air movement. We have dual zone AC's, and the slab was over 6' long & a foot thick, so it must have been over a 1,000 lbs. And he made sure the slab tilted slightly so rain would drain away from the house. Incredible. His final bill was more than reasonable - a few $100 over the original quote. We paid him about ~$2K more than the awfully horrible install of the sad Goodman AC system back in 2009, and this had a 1/2 ton upgrade on one of the units, and both are a couple seer higher, AND are Trane's! Blake even rebuilt the air handler pedestal in the garage, insulated it, and sealed it. This man does not advertise - I can see why. It would be a waste of honest money. Blake is a rare find. I was convinced his kind went extinct long ago. May his gene pool increase."

8oJGvieNjG6JGhRD4iIu5A,HFItzRohDHZvcKDrM6ABZg,"I purchased a voucher for a 6-month membership at Florida Jack's located at the corner of Yonge/Bloor for $199.

I am a fan of group fitness classes because I find it adds variety to my workouts.  I have done boxing classes before.

First and foremost, this is a small gym.  It is located on the second floor.  It is shared by a few fitness companies, Evolution Fitness being one of them.  

On the third floor is the boxing area.  Equipped with punching bags and a boxing ring.  This is where my class was.  I took the Beginner/Intermediate class, and everyone else in the class seemed to be regulars.  

It was an intimidating experience.  First and foremost, I didn't know how to wrap my wrists.  I approached the instructor, Eric, and he wrapped my wrists for me.   He suggested I buy my own, which was good advice for personal hygiene reasons.  

The class started, and the music was blaring, and drowned out Eric's oral instructions.  I felt like the new kid on the block who was socially outcasted and left out by everyone else.  

He went through the moves so fast that it was frustrating as I didn't get myself well coordinated the first time.  I was also left sans partner and was left with practicing my punches and uppercuts on a punching bag.  

It was a frustrating experience, and I felt that the instructor really didn't care for beginners, as he focused his efforts on the regulars.  

I will probably not be coming back again, and rest assured I will be fighting for a refund."

Her gorgeous work hangs all over our house. We have young children and I thought for sure each time we had a session, Emily wouldn't have been able to get any good pictures. Little ones are prone to meltdowns, refusal to cooperate, lollipop smeared faces, etc. But each time she captured the most wonderful shots and her pictures truly tell the story of our family. I can't say enough good things about this talented lady. So glad we found her!"
YG9HmLHzoC1LxAOmnUYDNQ,kSX1GPyZeSMMvpHR6B-N8Q,"I'm torn on what rating to leave for Bevans. They rate very high in all of the fundamentals: cleanliness, friendliness, helpfulness, convenience, fair price. I called 1/2 hour before closing to see if I could get my cat's nails trimmed if I could arrive within 5 minutes and they gladly fit me in. The groomer was professional and handled my cat in a no-nonsense way, which is my personal choice...do the job quickly and offer a firm but kind hand to keep the pet calm. I also liked that since I was getting a service that was a quick one, I was able to be in the grooming room with my cat. This to me is great! On the negative side, their selection of products is very thin. It wouldn't be a good idea to have Bevans as a destination to purchase supplies but rather a ""while I'm here"" purchase. But the #1 reason I must give them a lower rating is kind of an odd one but turned out to really have a negative affect for me. Even though I didn't notice it while I was there, once I returned home I noticed an overwhelming perfume smell on my clothes. I am very sensitive to such strong odors and they give me severe migraines. Well, I of course could easily change clothes. But several hours later when I went to bed, I noticed that my cat, who likes to sleep next to my head, had the same strong perfume odor. It was so strong that it gave me a terrible migraine and even made my throat feel raw. I was very upset not just because it made me ill, but I also was worried how it would affect my cat. I still don't understand how this all happened. Was it the groomer's own personal perfume? Was it a pet shampoo smell, even though my cat wasn't shampoo'd? I don't know, but it was disturbing enough to be certain I will be unable to return to Bevans which is a shame. Everyone I came into contact with was so friendly and the groomer did a great job. Oh well, easy come easy go."

After telling my generous and gracious loving Wife what I did, i stumbled across Metrolina Body Shop and man was I happy I did.

The shop is impeccable! Well cared for, people clean, smiling and genuinely interested in serving you. Now, this is NOT a common experience as most shops are filled with grease, grime and people I wouldn't necessarily hang out with...except I met the owner. 

This guy was TOP SHELF. Caring, hilarious, bright and understands what people need...and he helped me. 

With one swoop of his hands under the car, he literally reset the entire car back into position! Now, Toyota wanted thousands to fix this and Metrolina just did what was far above and beyond the call of duty. He helped me...and now it's my turn to pay it forward for him. 

These people understand what it takes to take care of you and if even consider another body shop, you would be doing yourself a disservice. 

Thank you Metrolina. You made a difference for me. I appreciate you and respect how you treated me.

We ordered a large pizza, wings, & breadsticks. We were told it would arrive within 40-50 minutes. We only live 1 mile from the place. 

1 1/2 hours later I called to see what was going on and was told the driver left 10-15 minutes ago. The person I spoke to on the phone was not helpful and didn't really seem to care that we had been waiting so long for our dinner. 

When our food finally did arrive they were missing the breadsticks and extra marinara. The food tasted absolutely TERRIBLE. The pizza wasn't even cut all the way through.

i2sPQCTBYmcLJHiRAUzo_Q,1eVSM6naSQ4XHczg-NnTtw,"Title Nine is a clothing store for active women.  The branch at Hilldale is the newest of 14 from this California company.  I've bought from their catalog for years, and was thrilled to see them open a shop in Madison.  And after my first visit, it looks like they've done it right.

The retail store has limited space, so this fall they've concentrated on their basic and cold weather items.  The space is no-frills attractive, the layout more browsable than tightly organized.  Staff were friendly and helpful, but didn't hover.  The woman who waited on me showed up every so often to put my stuff in a fitting room and answer questions; other than that, she let me do my thing.  Both clerks present that day knew the merchandise.

This is not a cheap place to shop.  A top may cost $50, a pair of pants or sweatshirt $75, and outerwear more like $100.  What you get for that is a well-made item that's both functional and attractive, made for movement, and in many cases suitable for athletic, outdoor use.  They're well-sewn, using technical fabrics and other synthetics, as well as some cotton and wool.

They will also help you with items from the mail-order catalog, if you want to order something that's not in the store, or have a problem or return.  I have been happy with 95% of what I've ordered from them for the past five years or so.  Having the store is even better, because it takes out the guesswork."

When we come to the Heard, either here or in way North Scottsdale, we find we can never leave without a purchase or two.  Granted the jewelry case is much harder to resist.  But, most of the jewelry items are similar to those found elsewhere, such as in Old Town Scottsdale.  It's a matter of price and what catches your eye.

As I mentioned above, the other Museum shop is filled with books and food items for the home, or to send away to family members as gifts for birthdays and the Holidays.  Recently we were here with an out of town relative and must of picked the close-out book section clean.

XJlYrK-2g6l6t5VF8cBFUg,8959F5stCzJWI_I7dgxurg,"I've been getting my taxes done here for over 5 years.  Everybody at the firm is super friendly, helpful and very professional.  There are several accountants, but the only one I have used is Aaron Blau and he is excellent.  He takes the extra time needed to explain things to me because this tax stuff can be pretty confusing.

My wife started her law practice about a year ago and Aaron assisted in setting up the books, payroll and other misc. stuff including solid tax planning advice.

I like it that they are able to provide personal accounting services at a very reasonable price no matter what stage in life you are in or how much money you make.  I started with them when I was in college,  when I got my first real job and now my wife uses them for her law practice.  There were many different jobs and life-changes in between all that and they were able to provide advice and help plan for the future.  I guess the most important thing is that they successfully keep the IRS from knocking at our door while somehow getting us some $$$$ back!

Anyway, everything at the firm is top notch and we will continue to use their services for years to come."

I waited until 2:43 and no one greeted me or helped me ( beyond the receptionist) and I ended up walking out. Why schedule an appointment if not going to keep it. My time is just as precious as yours and if not more! Also stop making excuses the sales people are with other customers.

It's sad but true that so many people out there are in the field of helping people but they really are doing it just for the money.

IU3LHDXYYQctW7JhQlXKoA,K2ZswR5OKb_rLFJTZQaeVA,"Bender performing arts offers a variety of classes in many disciplines. This includes a competitive performing company called Dancemotion, a full theater department, music and voice lessons, and dance/gymnastics. 

The problems with BPA are rooted in the inequities that exist between the performing company and all of the other disciplines. For example, if your child takes a few dance classes just for fun, their class will be showcased in the recital at the end of the school year. This is the only stage time your student will get, which is pretty normal for any dance studio.  

However, as opposed to taking this opportunity to highlight non-company dancers in their only production of the year, BPA pads the recital with Dancemotion performances, making it a tedious three hours long. It is insult to injury for these dancers and their parents when you consider that Dancemotion participates in at least two full length productions of their own earlier in the year, in addition to competing and performing in multiple venues year round. With tuition that can barely be called competitive, forcing parents to sit through forty-five minutes of previously performed company show dances in order to get to their own child's 3 minute routine is unnecessary, to say the least. 

The theater program that has been developing over the last few years can only be described as amateur hour. Last season was filled with contradictory emails, numerous additional fees, and a complete lack of organization. There was no focus on skill or technique, only a push for over acting worthy only of an audience wide cringe. The kids worked REALLY hard, but without proper direction were unable to produce anything of quality. AGAIN, adding insult to injury, BPA padded their musical theatre productions with company performers, all the way down to casting the lead roles with the children and family members of the owners and directors. 

To contrast our experience at BPA, there are many highly successful community theaters in town. These organizations are usually set up as nonprofits. They are professionals with experience in theater and directing. They know how to put on a top notch show. The audition process is based on merit, and is free from bias. In my experiences, rehearsals and most costuming were free of charge, with the expectation that parents donate just a little of their time for volunteering during the performances. However, every theater is different, and you would be wise to read the fine print before signing up anywhere. Some examples of good venues here in Phoenix are Valley Youth Theatre, Theatre Works, And Stagebrush Community Theatre. 

In short, if your child is skilled enough to get into the dance company at BPA, and you can afford the pricey tuition, this might be the place for you. If your child is interested in musical theater and dancing for fun, you should seriously consider other options."

Z7lRCPa9MPwFRg18DaOXlg,HhYUDP1vR7CSRi2cvfai0Q,"The reviews for this chapel are pretty understandable, however I still give them three stars and I'll explain why. My mom was getting remarried and had driven by this chapel hundreds of times over the years. We looked into it and yes communication with Cindy is atrocious! I mean really bad, and she can be rather rude. She rarely responds and you have to practically stalk her to find out if your even booked. Also the day before the wedding we had some rehearsal time at the chapel. A different woman was there and she was also rather rude, and apparently had a poor opinion of Cindy (she was rather vocal about it). We laughed it off and rolled with it, because what are you going to do the day before the wedding. 

Now, I still give it 3 stars because the venue itself is beautiful. If you like that rustic, colonial, puritan vibe then this place is 100% for you, even with the poor service. The natural light is phenomenal and allows for great pictures. The bonus is the beautiful graveyard and the cute labyrinth. I know a graveyard isn't exactly ""wedding"" appropriate, but again it's kind of how my family rolls lol. 

So... yes the staff is stressful and crappy at their jobs, but the venue is amazing anyways. As long as you are aware of the pitfalls and know you will have to micromanage (aka harass) the staff, that should eliminate the stress and your big day will still be beautiful."

You don't want to get jerked around, you don't want to get lied to, you don't want to get scammed. Ideally, you just want to pay the person a fair transaction to get the job fixed as painless as possible.

Jim is that guy. My family and I have been going to Jim's for a decade and he's always been fair and communicative and reasonably priced.

Not only that, but Jim has stood up for his customers in the court of law on a few occasions (my mother being one of them) fighting other automobile shyster who have at one point or another tried to defraud his customers. If there is anything this guy hates, it's someone trying to be dishonest.

I will note however Jim and Pals are pretty high in demand and the waiting list can be high at times. If you only have one car and can't work out some leapfrog approach with a friends automobile the wait may be too long for you.

mgkF33BgKpjsKn1uzUyTww,WoKCLSctS7G2547xKcED-Q,"*This is a review of their Friday fish fry only.*

I went here with a friend because it was one of the few Friday fish frys that offered lunch.  Here at St. Maximilian Kolbe Parish, fish fry is open not just during Lent, but every Friday from September through the end of May.  The menu changes, though, and some special items are only available during Lent.

For around $10, there are lots of options here and I don't just mean take out or eat in.  Options include fried or baked fish as either a sandwich or dinner.  The dinner includes two sides (fries and cole slaw).  Other choices are crab cakes or shrimp dinner, linguini with shrimp or scallops, egg salad on a croissant, tuna salad stuffed tomato and tuna salad on a croissant.  I got a look at those egg and tuna salad sandwiches and they are much larger than your average croissant.  There is a list of several other items sold individually: pierogies, haluski, mac n cheese, potato pancakes.  Drinks and dessert are available but not included in the price of dinners.

There is parking available at the church and the hall itself is not that spacious but we did not have a problem with crowds during lunch (around 1pm).  

I ordered the fried fish dinner that came with crinkle cut fries and a vinegar based cole slaw (no substitutions allowed).  The sides were okay but that piece of fish was enormous and hanging off the plate.  It's served with a bun to be eaten as a sandwich but I didn't even try.  I pushed aside the bun and went right for the fish.  The breading was just right and the fish was flaky and delicious.  One dinner is definitely a meal two people could share (if maybe they ordered an extra side or two).  I couldn't finish it all myself.

Hook, line and sinker, this Homestead parish has now made my list of go-to fish frys."

I have naturally curly hair and no inclination to spend much time on it, so I just need a haircut that will bring out my texture and not take much time to style.

A friend of mine used to go to Rejuvenation and get her hair cut and colored. The cuts always looked terrific (the color did, too, even though her hair was a great color to begin with). I live in Sun Prairie, so driving over to Rejuvenation was a bigger time commitment than I wanted to make for my hair. 

But when my friend told me that her stylist had moved to her own place (though sadly still on the west side), and then another friend (with very fine hair) was introduced to and liked this same stylist - I thought the time had come. That was how I had my hair cut by Amber. 

She really knows her way around curly hair. The first time she washed it and then cut it, which cost a little more but scored me a neck massage (mmmmmm). The second time she cut it dry  (which I've read about but never experienced before) which took about half the time but still gave me a terrific haircut. 

Driving to the west side isn't so bad after all, as long as I'm getting such good haircuts. Also, Amber is nice to talk with. I've been to salons where the stylists are just too cool for their own good, and I was intimidated and felt like a lame suburban housewife (wait, never mind). But Amber is non-judgmental (even when I was severely overdue for a cut) and just very *nice*. An under-rated quality."

**Please note, I'm not rating them based on the work they have done so far..i don't have a clue as to whether or not they do good work BECAUSE THEY CANT BE BOTHERED TO SHOW UP WHEN THEY ARE SCHEDULED.**

I've been in the process of a home remodel and have been waiting and waiting for my counters to be put in, which has been taking forever, but they were FINALLY going to be installed yesterday. I was out of town and coming home last night, so everything was set up to have my house unlocked for English to come in and install then I was going to run by my house when I got into town to lock up.  They were scheduled at 8am, I got back after 5pm and go to my house.....where the installers never came.  No communication, no show, nothing.  I have no idea who dropped the ball but I'm pretty pissed.
So just be aware that if you choose to use this company , plan to not have counter tops for at least 3+ weeks.

9i4ftKXTyyzZqjXxd4E77w,7tCL10cCP1EzOXyILgnMvA,"Halfway up Flowergate in Whitby is Sherlock's, one of our favourite coffee shops in Whitby. Always incredibly busy due to its reputation, we tried twice to get a table at Christmas, both times unsuccessfully. We were fortunate enough this time to grab a table in this unique coffee shop. The building dates from the 17th Century, and is full of lots of different little areas in which to dine. Lots of ephemera around the Sherlock theme and Victorian type decoration all add to the ambiance. Tables to suit all group sizes too and the chairs are very comfortable, like sitting in your own lounge!

A decent sized menu, with a good range of hot and cold drinks, lunches and of course there are the famous cakes; they even do themed desserts like Dracula's Delight! My wife opted for their fruit scone with jam, baked throughout the day on site. So tasty that once we even witnessed somebody storm out of the shop, when they had temporarily run out! I had the Sherlocks's Toasted Stottie with sweet peppers, pesto, tangy sundried tomatoes and mozzarella, great flavours and accompanied by a dressed fresh salad. Coupled with two great cups of coffees, all for less than a tenner, great stuff. The staff are efficient and friendly too. The only thing that slightly lets Sherlock's down are the somewhat dishevelled state of the toilets"

Why am I a fan? I love the variety here... of grocery stores. Yes it's true, there's a Safeway, Superstore, Super Walmart andddddd a Co-op all on the same street. There's a Sobey's about 5 mins away. 

There's also new stores coming up all the time, there's a Home Depot and Lowes facing each other, along with a Canadian tire down the street. This street has everything I need.. I think... a movie theater would be great. 

My only problem is that it's completely impossible to navigate through the strip malls.. especially down by the BMO/Co-op gas station. Horrrrrrrrible urban planning. There's not enough ways in and out."

We arrived looking forward to our favorite Deuces Wild breakfast but found a fifties themed diner with a whole new menu. We're happy to try something new.  The restaurant is called Mary's Diner. It's cute and thankfully the old servers are still there. Lupe is a doll, has been here for 22 years! 

So the prices went up, my Skillet was $6.99,which is not a bad price, but I was hoping it would taste good too but it was really bland instead. There is less of a breakfast selection, gone are the old favorites. No substitutions either. Talk about corporate menu unfriendliness. 

I do hope corporate makes a few tweaks to improve the food. I like the service and the servers here. They've all been here a long time and we would have fun razzing them when they wore a football jersey from an opposing team. That's gone too. :-("

I asked the sales associate if they had long lengths as I'm tall & most jogging pants don't fit. She said they have yoga pants. I told her I didn't ask for yoga pants, I asked for jogging pants. She said that most of them were really long as she had bought them and they were long on her. I looked DOWN at her as she was 2 feet shorter than my pinkie finger and said that I wasn't asking for her height, I was asking for mine. I held the pants up to my waist, showed her that on ME, they are not long, dropped the pants on a pile, pivoted and walked out.

I had someone come out for 2 plumbing issues.. A leaking sink and tub. I was charged 3 hours of labor for sealing a leak under the kitchen sink and an attempt to repair the tub leak. The tub leak was not able to be fixed because of the need to replace a valve. The technician spent hours trying to find the water source in the house and then left to go get parts to attempt to repair the tub leak. I was charged 441.00 for labor and the cost of repairing the leak under the sink which was ""sealed.""
After sending a request to speak with the technician to find out exact details of the work, their accounting department sent a return email only that stated they overcharged for the work done and credited 200.00. The total cost still remained at 288.00. I was charged for the time the tech left and attempted to find a part for work that was not completed. After knowing their inconsistency in their work, I will no longer use their services. Very disappointed."

4_m4Liqvt-0UnWB5gPxJNw,0BBUmH7Krcax1RZgbH4fSA,"Customized flash frozen ice cream, made fresh in front you. 

You choose your milk percentage (Traditional 10%, Super Premium 17%, Gelato 6%, Yogurt 0.5% and Sorbetto 0%), choose your basic flavouring, and choose your mix-ins. All this gets a blast of liquid nitrogen and ta-dah! instant ice cream. 

Does it taste really that different? It's fresh and all natural for sure. But it's a little gimmicky. But their price point is not too bad ($3.09 for a small cup, $4.78 for medium and $5.19 for a large,), would gladly go for this rather than BR.

However, the wait time for this I would say is about 5 mins, if there is no line up. With one other group in line, it was about 10 mins before we got ours. I found that the staff here was tired (around 4pm) and she seemed a little out of it and confused sometimes. She prepares the recipe in a bowl, and lines up for the 'chef' to flash freeze while constantly mixing in the stuffs. He also tastes each one before mixing it in. It looked like hard work. 

I wanted to get their Matcha Green Tea with Strawberries. But they were out of green tea. I switched it to Cappucino, and she talked me out of added strawberries for some reason. I thought this was supposed to be customized. 

They say that their operation is short staffed, but at the same time, I don't know how you can add another person in that booth or what they would do. She takes the orders, he mixes (there was only one nitrogen tank), and another girl washes things. 
There are a lot of fixings, but its not displayed (would be nice) and sort of strewn along the counter. 

It's a good idea, I don't know how financially sustainable it will be compared to the effort required. Also, their menu needs to be a bit bigger, so it's easier for people to pick. At the same time, their website boasts pre-made creations but they are not posted on the menu at their booth. 
Also a lot of the ingredients on the website, don't match up with what I saw. 

Its tucked away near the No Frills of Dufferin mall. Yes, It competes with the Baskin and Robbins, and makes me wonder why they didn't put their location closer to them. Given, a choice, I'd wait an extra few minutes for this. Maybe they can't handle the traffic. But, as it turns out this is a soft launch, and I guess they are testing. 

I wonder if they would do a Soy Milk base. That would be nice. 

I'll be interested to see how this goes. Would have been better to open in the summer."
PgGHZLmxjNjw1ImCTNQ67A,GIZXLWqutXUP2cDXvuSfUw,"Haha, first to review. Something tells me the folks who frequent this place do so out of necessity, simple convenience, or happen-stance. 

This is my closest local hardware store. I love supporting local business (although its a chain) but I usually bike to Canadian Tire for my odds n ends/light bulbs/handy things because they can be pretty cheap there. The prices there (and at every Home Hardware I've ever been to) are nearly double the price that I can source the products for elsewhere.. so I only go here when I'm in a pinch or I want to treat myself to an over-priced hardware product and excellent customer service. 

The folks who work here are very friendly and knowledgeable. Recently, they set me up with all the bits and pieces I needed to build a cold frame.. helping me choose bolts, hinges, etc that work with the tools, materials, and ideas I had. And they're really sweet. They always keep treats behind the counter for dogs and whenever I walk by with my dog she strains toward the doorway in anticipation of a snausage. 

One time, however, I went in hoping to replace a fairly conventional halogen lightbulb for a desk lamp. They didn't have it and they told me that Ikea was probably the only place I could find such bulbs, which is not true and would have been very inconvenient for me had I not known better. This place is old school and a lot of the products on the shelves look to be at least 5 years old."
By5t_SapEX5TAxT9P4G24g,oo2-4ZEdyodJ6xlRC4eQHQ,"They were responsive and prompt for the appointment.  I called to get an estimate on a basement remodel and inquired about several other smaller jobs while the owner was here.  I ended up not hiring them because they wouldn't give me a fixed price, but wanted to charge by the hour and add a 30% surcharge to any supplies they purchased for the job.  

In a reply to a review that I posted on Angie's list, the owner tried to state some of the work was started and not completed plus that it was sub par which led to a lot of unknown factors.  This is simply not true since in the basement the existing paneling and ceiling tiles were removed along with the tile floor. The window trim that I wanted replaced was damaged when the new windows were installed. You don't partially replace exterior lights or doors.

It should be pretty straight forward to take measurements of a room and figure out how much drywall it would take and how long it should take to put it up.  Some people might be okay with paying by the hour and possible getting over charged, but I wasn't.  It also made it impossible to compare to the other fixed bid that I did receive for the basement remodel."

Cat has still has the same store number, so call her if you were planning on dropping by. She's open by appointment only now. Showing up at the door and ringing to see if she can let you in her counts as an appointment, so she's pretty laid back about it.

H4j2vhb9NKEiqsG5tqS3wQ,tkYKsqiYKJ8eimYrmSimuQ,"I was referred to Kyle Scoresby by a friend that did not know better than to let this man represent my dog in a food theft allegation.  My divorce was not supposed to be complicated - and I was willing to settle for far less than what the law says the 50% would be mine because I could not get my ex wife to be my ex fast enough.  In our first meeting, I laid out the terms of a settlement I was willing to accept.  

Next thing I know, this guy is issuing all kinds of document requests from banks, employers, scheduling depositions - he escalated my case to a level that created an aggressive and confrontational response, which then escalated his involvement even more.  In 1 month, he racked up over $4,000.00 in fees!!  I went in and met with him and told him again I was willing to settle.  That conversation got me over $6,000.00 in fees for the second month - and no conversation of settlement, no court date, NOTHING had actually been done to advance the divorce - it was all just legal maneuvering!  I had to resort to firing him as my attorney for total incompetence in acting in my best interest.  He was all about HIS best interest to bill for as many hours as possible.

After I fired him - it only took me 1 phone call and 1 email to get us to the settlement table.  I totally wasted $10K on a blood sucking selfish attorney - no wonder they all have the reputation they do.

If you want someone who is expert at racking up fees, getting everybody angry including you as his client - and in the end doing nothing for you to really help - then hire this fraud!

It seems the employees at VisaCenter Toronto have never learnt what customer service and product knowledge is all about, starting with the receptionist whose head doesn't know what her tail is doing. She is always dumbfounded and speaks with a lot of uhhhsss n ummmmms.

Towards end of February I had applied for a Schengen visa for travel during second week of April and upon acceptance of my application I received an email saying that it's too early and it'll be put on hold till the required date. 

Couple of weeks later I get the package with required forms n checklist of VFS for my visa appointment and wait for it, my visa interview was in OTTAWA. I called them stating that while applying I had chosen Toronto as I live there so why on earth was I assigned Ottawa? The agent replied that it's the jurisdiction that chooses the centre and that was something which didn't sound convincing. By now it was too late to withdraw my application as my travel dates were getting closer. 

So as stupid as I may look, I drove to VFS Ottawa with all my required documents and upon meeting the officer working there I was charged their visa fee with taxes which mind you'll I had paid VISACENTER when I'd applied for Schengen visa on day 1 and I had the receipt to prove it as well.
It seems VFS - the official Visa application center for most countries do not recognize VISACENTER as their affiliates which means VISACENTER is running some sort of a scam and someone needs to put a stop to their horrible practices.

Also the officer at VFS told me that it takes 15 days for the consulate to approve my application and dispatch my passport and I had barely a week left before I could travel.
Luckily my application was accepted in no time and I could travel hassle free.

I had a wonderful vacation but not at the cost of what I went through and I urge every individual to please read this review before giving VISACENTER your business."

The staff are mostly or all bilingual in English and French, which is great.  The soaps aren't too pricey for what they are, and they smell amazing (depending on what you like).

They go out of your way to show you vegan products (which they have a lot of) when you ask, and when you buy something they usually (or always?) give you a free sample of something, which is definitely appreciated.  So yeah, it's a good place."
MHFWpZY47XSnkXuzeWJnFg,zsZBYWYEmLLs81_f-HHM8w,"After having lunch at On the Border in the same shopping center (Promenade on Providence), I thought I would zip over to see what Steinmart had for my new place.  A lamp perhaps?  A new bedspread?  Maybe a picture for my guest bathroom?  Candles?  Steinmart had all of this and then some.

A very clean store, the employees that I encountered seemed friendly enough.  I breezed through the chubby ladies section, which was small, and it seemed to contain mostly meemaw clothes.  No problem - meemaws need clothes too, so I moved along to the home goods sections.  I found their bathroom items (shower curtains, towels, rugs) to be a mixture of items that seemed to be fairly well priced, to items that I thought I could get a better price at Bed Bath and Beyond for (definitely with a 20% coupon).  I moved next to bedding and found several blankets that I would have taken.  A king size blanket in a lovely shade of green (they had LOTS of colors of solid quilts/blankets, along with a few prints as well) was only $30, which I thought was a very good price after recently dropping $70 for a comparable item at Target.  

Onto knick knacks, kitchen and even pet items.  I found a microfiber pet bed that looked like a chaise lounge that matched my living room furniture exactly, so that had to be purchased for my cat ($60).  They had several different scents of Yankee Candles, although not scents that i have seen in the Yankee store or on their website, for quite a bit less than standard retail prices for that brand ($10 for small tumbler that is typically $15+).  I picked up a kitchen spice candle to see if it is good as what I would purchase at Yankee Candle.  A double walled cup with a straw needed to be purchased for $7.

They had a somewhat large section of purses and shoes, although I didn't really need either, so I didn't shop those sections.  This store seems to have a little bit of everything kind of like a Ross/Marshall's, but much better organized than what I remember Ross/Marshall's being, and I was happy that I stopped by to check it out."

Their facility is clean, spacious, and modern, with lots of equipment and accessories to get people ""back"" on track.  Along with their effective care, they teach patients a variety of home exercises and practices so each person can take an active role in improving their health.  Today's healthcare system has myriad problems...thankfully Active Life Health and Wellness provides solutions!"

The gentleman at the desk was very friendly as well. The surroundings are very peaceful and serene with a lake. The room was inviting and calming. I'd say it was the best massage experience I've had in a long time."
Y1xOdL5zt10TiM4MOV2Utg,lDSwCgPW0FjJL2L3IJaz9A,This place is incredibly aesthetic. The staff here is so sweet. They chatted with my friend and I and even gave us a free croissant to try. All their drinks are strong and they always offer to make the drink again if it isn't what you like. Will be coming back very often!
bX5t4CXzQQg1JS46aJYywQ,hbWIuinoVkMFS3WHAlBOzA,We just went on a trip with Allegiant Travel Company to Las Vegas.  We used Showtime Transportation as part of the package to get between the airport and the hotel.  Guess what - our return shuttle was so late that we had to take a cab to the airport - WHICH TURNED OUT CHEAPER THAN THE SHUTTLE FEE - and by the time we got to the airport - we had to throw our liquids that we had bought at the bath and body in the TRASH because the lines were too long to check a bag.  Allegiant airlines refunded our baggage fee for the suitcase we didn't have time to check - but Showtime Transportation said they couldn't refund our shopping costs as it is against their policy.  They admit it was their delays that caused the issue but couldn't stand behind a $50 request for reimbursement.  A very sad way to end a great vacation.  My advice - TAKE A CAB!!!
ggZ3ElY09a8UgkF4WaTUyA,rPtdBUC7ypFguYBzVlc-aw,"Do not hire this contractor.  Everything was of course perfect leading up to signing the contract, except prices were a little high.  We negotiated down some.  He understood everything we wanted (so we were lead to believe), and even made suggestions.  We signed the contract with all the design features spelled out, then magically the design described in the contract was not doable for that price.  6 weeks of arguing later, we find out his stone subcontractor is doing 90% of the entire work.  3 of those weeks were spent waiting on this stone sub to finish other work.  B&E had him price a standard design that didn't match our agreement.  B&E was getting paid something like 15% to simply manage the project, not build anything, and they couldn't even manage to communicate our design to the main sub.  We were issued a huge change order, couldn't reach an agreement, and terminated the contract.  What other change orders were headed my way if we actually let them build???  Again, do not hire this contractor."

When walking in, you notice that it's a different decor than the others. They sell Crabtree and Evelyn products along with this huge organic and gluten free section in back. There's also regular Shoppers items in here too. 

The problem is, that it looks seedy and dusty and not that appealing. If they put brighter lights, I think the look of the store would appeal more.

I had to take the car again to the store and they refund me for the wrong invoice and kept my car for a few days to fix the scratches.

We don't go here often, mainly for special occasions, but we have never been truly disappointed. They offer many different varieties of shortbread, but the shortbread stuffed with the chocolate caramel or the shortbread bar with a layer of caramel and chocolate drizzle are by far our favourites. However, if shortbread isn't your favourite don't fret because they also offer a variety of other types of cookies. Once, years ago we ordered a cake for a family gathering, and while it wasn't the best, the cookies definitely make up for it. As long as it stays open we'll be back from time to time to get a sweet fix!"

I left him several messages before he ever called me back, and when he did his attitude couldn't have been any more rude.  He claimed he delivered them, and treated me like I was owed nothing.  I ended up asking for my money back, and told him to forget about the pictures.  We'll see if I get it back.  He did offer to reprint the pics, and send them a few weeks later.  When I asked him why it would take a few weeks his response was ""do you want them or not?"".  I just don't do business with people who treat customers like this.  I hope you don't either.

I would never use him again!"
IiwoP08d-ehTTJVWAHuJKw,q3Y0HKr-ofTbP7bh2T5auQ,"I was very excited to book a tour to Death Valley. I did a lot of research on which tour to take, and despite reading some negative reviews, such as unpleasant seating, this was one of the few tours that offered a trip to DV in July.

Unfortunately, I fell ill on the Friday before the Sunday tour and ended up changing all of my travel plans, including canceling this trip. Be warned: the cancellation policy is 48 hours in advance. If you call merely two hours after that (like I did), you will be denied any type of refund. Actually, the Bindlestiff tour representative that I spoke with on the phone stated, ""Oh yeah the manager is a real stickler on the refund policy. Someone recently canceled because they were hospitalized and we still didn't refund them!"" 

The lack of empathy and customer service here is disappointing. The fact that I didn't go on the tour, when it was confirmed that the tour still had available seating, and my presence or lack thereof, did not impact anyone, seems fraudulent. 

They did say I could reschedule, however only allowed a 30 day window to do that. Not much to work with when you are from out of town."
qJLxcfNPnla1RvipRLAonw,qHCiF1xKfq167alpLcHNCw,"My experience with Steven was outstanding; he is extremely professional, very pleasant to deal with, and his talent as a painter is truly excellent!

I called Steven to paint the flashing and fascia of our new roof and he was able to provide me with a price quote over the phone. The cost of the project seemed reasonable so, I booked him and he came out two days later.

Upon his arrival, Steven and I walked the perimeter of the home and he noted a section of the house that was not included in the price of the project (I had planned on painting that myself just to save a few pennies).  I explained to Steven that it just wasn't in my budget and he immediately offered to paint it WITHOUT RAISING THE PRICE; he even gave me his business card so I could get a discount on paint!  He never once tried to up-sell me on anything that I did not request.

I was completely stunned by Steven's kindness and generosity; not only is he a skillful painter, but he truly is a pleasant person to work with.  Steven completed the project to absolute perfection; he promptly arrived at the designated time, he took extra precaution to protect the surrounding landscape, and he was meticulous in cleaning up.

I was so impressed with Steven's work ethic that I immediately requested another quote and I plan on scheduling the project in the very near future.  I highly recommend Carroll's Painting; Steven is an honest business owner who works hard to complete the project in a timely manner and to earn the trust of his clients."

Plan to spend 2 to 3 consecutive hours here. Bring a coffee, take a break and eat at the Liberty across the way (or Tupelo on the second floor), and just have fun. 

Picking out house materials can seem like an overwhelming task. Granted, I'm not gifted at knowing what flooring pairs nicely with which backsplash tile. However, I know it when I see it. Sophia was very helpful in pairing different materials together and also getting the details down to the color of the grout (which I had no idea it even mattered). 

They have a terrific assortment of materials from the basic and traditional, to the classic and timeless, to the trendy and colorfully patterned. It's everything from flooring, backsplash, countertops, accent tiles to make your kitchen or bathroom amazing."

They didn't clean up the bushes, trees or prune the trees in the front like they promised ""it's going to look like a model home"". I paid what he asked for the work.

I never imagined that I would have the body that I have now. Thanks to his professionalism and consistent coaching to push me I have really been able to make some serious strides in my workout.

pI2UxM0VnWbrFauLEXXXcg,4Ty_20vcpCSXSpcpXV9CZw,"Friday has an older more chill crowd. Saturday has a younger crowd. If you're over 30, opt for Friday. The music 'can' be good, and the place is nice with a decent male female ratio. Worth checking out. Dress up here as dress code is in effect. Drinks selection is ok, and there's a nice little dance floor. Don't show up without a reservation or you will stand around with nowhere to sit, and worse nowhere to put your drink at all. The night we had a reservation was good as we could sit and park our drinks; the night we did not, was just tiring, mostly from trying to hold drinks. The place is geared too much towards drink, drink and not so much of a good time. Manager and staff walks around looking grumpy if people are not drinking. The place comes across as trying to hard to be classy. We put our drinks down on a  barrel - the only place in the whole entire place with a surface and the waiter, would maliciously scoop up the drinks, literally the second we had our backs turned -- when they were still clearly full? This happened twice! Weird. 
 So, get a reservation with a small group where your minimum spend is $250 plus tip to get a table and service (those are the actual rules, although, I wonder if that's even legal, or don't bother showing up, unless you're OK standing all night, with no where to put your drinks."

Everything was perfect, from start to finish. I was able to rent a u-haul online schedule a time for pick up and drop off.  Shortly after booking my u-haul, I got a confirmation email.  

My rental was for a Saturday at 11:00 am. When I arrived the staff was so down to earth and efficient.  The u-haul store had EVERYTHING!!! you could ever want for a move.  I ended up purchasing some moving gloves and mattress covers. Check in was super easy they had everything waiting there for me to sign. It took less than 10 minutes to get signed and review the disclosures. Talk about hassle free. 

We rented a van , I think it was a ford e-350 model, but don't get me to lie.
This fan rocked It was so clean on the inside it was like we were the first people to have ever driven in it.  Brand spanking new baby. 

The clerk at the store even gave us an extra half hour of time for free. Which ended up coming in handy.  Moving is so hard and doing business with this u-haul location really took  some stress out of the equation.

What sets this apart from a regular walmart is that in addition all the stuff you can get  from toothpaste to furniture  they have Produce, a Bakery, A Deli,  a meat section and a Frozen Food section. 
For those who like Tim Hortons and McDonalds, they have those in the store too.
The aisles are wide, and the store is spotless. In particular, the produce section is quite beautiful full of the vibrant  very fresh produce. The frozen food section has really nice black  eco friendly freezers that light up when you walk by them ( if the light is off). The bakery section is quite large, and always fully stocked with fresh items.

YVwbfDRE75n75YxK8AqzMw,dTAIFnLDtY1IvsmQIGOtjA,"I started learning Kung Fu with my daughter at Rothrock's 5 years ago and it has changed both of our lives. At first we just thought it would be a fun activity to do together a few times per week but as we continued to train we realized Rothrock's provides more than a great workout. 

I have watched my daughter gain focus and self discipline and a ""never give up"" attitude in her schoolwork and in many other areas of her life. As a parent, that kind of discipline is irreplaceable. The day she achieved her goal of earning a black belt was a day I know she will never forget.

As for myself, I have never felt stronger or more confident and healthy than I do now as a result of studying under Mr. Solito and Master Rothrock. More than health, I have also found a community of friends who care if I show up for classes as we all hold each other accountable to be the best martial arts students we can be. 

If you are considering martial arts, self defense, a personalized workout or starting authentic, traditional Tai Chi, Rothrock's is really the only place to consider in Pittsburgh."

Our apartment is suitably spacious enough to allow for creative living that compliments the rectangular and perpendicular interior corner shapes mandate by the buildings unique circular design. In the five plus years that I have lived at the Roundhouse, I have always found the on-site management staff to be personable, helpful and professional.

The sheet music is sometimes hard to find, so you may need some help from the staff.  There are rows and rows of filing cabinets, and an excellent inventory of music.

They are well stocked in terms of accessories, such as strings, mutes, music stands, etc.  They have plenty of parking in a private lot.

The salespeople are rather helpful and knowledgeable, but sometimes you need to ask for help or advice.  It's a large store, and sometimes I've noticed I need to walk up to the desk and ask for help."

eFF000MRzjxMNvIUJkRogA,N8_qnYm7GTBsFznVXTW09g,"I can't believe I haven't written a review about Forward Theater Company yet. I fear that this review will not adequately express my love for this company. But nonetheless, I will try.

In short: Forward Theater Company presents professional, modern, progressive plays, and IT IS AWESOME! 

I first became aware of Forward because my roommate was their technical director. He invited me to see the play he had been working on and gave me a ticket that had been reserved for him. I love theater so I was excited to go, but had only ever really seen productions I was already familiar with (Shakespeare, Broadway stuff etc). I went in with a open mind, but wasn't totally sure what to expect. 

The first play I saw was From Up Here by Liz Flahive, which is partially set in a modern day high school (so it included some amateur actors as well as professional). I was BLOWN AWAY. Literally moved to tears. The set, sound, actors, script, we're all amazing. Despite the fact that I had been given a free ticket, I paid for a ticket to see that show again.

I've made it a point to see every Forward show since and have never been disappointed. With modern themes (sometimes slightly provocative) I find the plays to be extremely engaging. 

So, I implore you -- Go see a show! You won't regret it."

I prefer more intense workouts and she doesn't because she's had an issue with her knee that causes her discomfort.  So we signed up for the 2 week trial to test the waters and she fell in love so we decided to join.  What we like about Koko is that every workout is customized for the individual.  Each person has a ""track"" to run on that can be changed at will.  I love the tracking Koko provides and it's actually motivating to see the results of each workout online. It's clean and the staff at this location is extremely friendly and helpful and they are willing to assist when you need it.  I wasn't sure it would work for me at first but like the concept and the results I've achieved after 10 weeks.  The only reason it's not a 5 Star for me is I feel the club should have more elliptical equipment.  I'm not a fan of treadmills at all."

She then sighed and gave me attitude. I told her I can come back if now isn't a good time. She said it's never a good time I'm always busy. She did her job and then charged me 10 instead of 7. I will never go again and I will never recommend this place to any of my friends. The young employees were very nice but the old hag needs a piece.

The vibe was kind of like Baha'i center; there was a cooking class and it smelt scrumptious, a kid's yoga class has just finished so there were people of all ages. The instructor demonstrated to the class what she wanted us to do, and would quietly explain finer points in English to me by the mat, which was loaned to me and all the props I needed. Occasionally she interjected English into the class, and was incredibly gentle.

We also tried the burger (also $11) and the sliders.  Lousy burger, it's grey, tasteless cadaver-meat.  Think school cafeteria burger only thicker.  Again, no toasted bun, not ketchup/mustard/mayo.

Just as I suspected, the prices in PINK is cheaper than the high end mothership.  The type of bra you'd get here is different, definately more fun, and flirty, and targeted towards the young person (18 to 40) however, my mom quite liked it. 

What really was the big difference for me other than price, was that the staff here is super attentive.  And the best part was my discovery of the Bra Box. 

I thought she was joking about getting me a bra of every style in the store in my size in a box.  She reached her hand out of the change room, and someone handed her something. It was like magic because inside this wooden box was all the styles of bras in the store, in my size. 
It's pre prepared, and I loved it allowing me o try things on at my leisure, quickly, efficiently, and then go choose my colours.  
After wandering around the big Victoria's Secret store aimlessly, this was a good change.

She even was as patient with me to bring multiple boxes, to help me figure out my size. I guess after wearing my cotton La Senza so much, higher end bras seem to fit me differently.

I was super pleased to find a bra that fit me. 

I also love the lounge wear at Pink."

Pizza hut advertises on their every invoice that fillup an online survey at pizzahutlistens.ca and get a special code to avail buy one get one free offer (BOGO). So like last several times we called the call center (only way to redeem) and availed the offer and arrived to pick our pizza.

They refused to honor the offer saying they don't have any such offer. We showed the older invoice (from 5 days ago) with the offer details. They still said they don't know about the offer and that the stores and call center are not connected even when they got the order from the call center.

On calling back and spending 20 mins on phone, pizza hut couldn't figure out how to honor their customer appreciation offer!

zM4VdWz2ln4eInxQsz33Xw,pakBpBuRD7TivtIbJ49r7g,"I am really sorry to read that previous reviews, which I may note are at least a couple of years old, are not very good. 
Perhaps Yelp has served its purpose and Belly Maternity has listened. I had a great experience at Belly Maternity today.

I am having my first child and have hesitated to enter the maternity clothing world. I refuse to settle with Thyme maternity ""fashions"". I was welcomed by the sales lady in the store (I regret to not have known her name), who happens to be the mother of the owner and who has much experience selling maternity clothes as she had her own maternity stores for many years.

I wanted to start by finding basics- tees, jeans, leggings. I literally went through the entire store. They have great, fashionable variety of selection. The sales lady walked through with me and made suggestions for pairing pieces together, she was very honest about what items were appropriate and flattering for me- she was honest about suggesting a larger size. What I enjoyed most was that she was willing to highlight which items were better value for their price, and not necessarily suggesting the most expensive items. Some items in the store are not necessarily ""maternity"" clothes, but are great for the maternity period and would accommodate for moms' bellies. What was awesome as well, was that the sales lady was very knowledgeable about her inventory in the store, sometimes making her way downstairs to get other sizes. 

To comment on prices, yes the prices are a bit difficult to swallow. However, the quality of the clothing is very good. Not having many other shops to compare to, I'm not sure if prices are higher. However, as an example, the 3-in-1 down parka (not the M coat) they were selling is the exact same price of $345 than at the other store I had previously visited. The goal anyway is not to buy an entirely new wardrobe- a few solid quality basic pieces to carry me through were what I was looking for and what I got. I, admittedly, will look for tanks and tees and long tees at other big box stores that carry maternity clothes, as I will want a larger amount of these items- Belly charges a pretty penny for their basic tops, but probably in line with MSRP pricing. 

Overall, my experience was very positive. The sales lady (I hate calling her that, because she provided a very personalized experience!) was down to earth, patient, and very helpful. The selection was very good quality and and variety. It was definitely worth the visit :)"

_kH0FjXR4ZcNG9ZsJ2TT3g,AvecQucBNHJ-HqmpPPzfpg,"I wish Yelp allowed a different rating for companies that process orders via an app, web site or by phone. 

www.pizzahut.ca was how I ordered my pizza and meal deal. 

The web site for Canada uses postal code to determine the nearest location.  However the postal code has to be split up. A0A 1B1 if not then the search seems to take for ever to process.  The web site also doesn't let Firefox so I had to use Internet Explorer.  

So I get the Game Day meal, 2 medium pizzas, 10 chicken bites, two dipping sauces and a litre bottle of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi or 7 Up. 

You select your first pizza from a list of set orders; meat lovers, Hawaiian.. Etc or you can create your own.  Then you click next and pick your second pizza.  However, if you need to change your pizza order the ""Back"" button had me back to square one.  So I had to reorder both pizzas again.  After you get past that, you select the dipping sauces, then the bites either plain or coated.  A decent selection of flavours for the bites.  I did wish that they offer the sauce on the side for the bites.  

However, after confirming everything I received an error message that the server had issues.  May be it was peak time, but really at 3:50 pm?!?  If that is peak, the web servers need to be replaced.  So I tried again and still got the same message.  Error.  So I tried to find the store number to place my order.  The web site prefers on-line orders not call in.  So I used Yelp! plus the Yelp! Reviews for this store were 3/5 and not 1/5 for the Pizza Hut Delivery across the road. 

So I called the store.  To my surprise they received the order even if I did not get an email or on-line confirmation.  Thankfully I called them.  Had I not I would have been surprised when the person showed up to deliver my order. 

So back to the review.  Pizzas were hot and tasty. The people I ordered the food for loved the dipping sauces and devoured the honey garlic bites.  I could have done with a little less sauce - the bottom bites were drowning.  The bonus item ordered, that was not part of the deal, was the Hershey cookie pan.  Also consumed with reckless abandon.  So with three hungry teens who are picky pizza eaters, it was money well spent."

I arrived about five minutes before 10:00 and expected to have to go to the counter to inform them that my prescription had just been sent earlier in the morning and I assumed I would need to get comfortable and wait but to my surprise Dr. Travis the head pharmacist recognized me and said my prescription was ready ...she comes in early to handle prescriptions that come in prior to opening.  I only had to wait for the registers to get on line a minute later and once they did she ensured I was immediately rung up! My expectations were exceeded and I love Dr. Travis and all the friendly people at this CVS location....will always be my preferred pharmacy.
cdm9TISDvuR94dMwm07EQw,PEXci6EGqeQ5TpIbEkJN9A,"this place is absolutely horrible. i have an extremely strong resistance to cavities ""thick enamel"" anyhow i get cleanings on time every 6 months and have never had a cavity in my entire life. not even as a child. so i get her and the dentist said i had 5 cavities. i refused service because i knew i didn't have any and felt he was just trying to earn money. i went back to another dentist that i don't like ""gentle dental"" who are ok besides their office staff. but upon my return there it was confirmed i had zero cavities. i contacted my insurance company to inform them what they are doing. i proceeded to allow him to finish a cleaning he literally finished in less than 3 minutes. he didn't scrap any tarter or calcium. just used a machine and 3 minutes or less he was done. worst dentist office in vegas. do not go!!!!!!!"
qvgo0I7j_BH_XRMxueO8Ag,4LeB46C_CywHskPGX58hBw,"Avoid this place! I dunno what units these ppl have but mine sucks!! I been here for a year now and the only nice places I seen here are the front office and the demo units! My A/C didn't work during the summer. They tell u its A/C but its a chiller system. I had no water AT ALL for about 3 days, and they turn water on and off when they feel like it and they dont give u any notice before it happens. I got notice like once or twice but it happened 6 or 7 times since i been here.

Don't expect any hot water here. They don't have any hot water for ur showers most of the time. I get 5 minutes of hot water then bam, it goes cold. When u tell the ppl at front office they just shrug and say to take a faster shower.

Don't expect peace and quiet. I live downstairs and hear everything, and i know that ppl make normal living noise when upstairs. that's not the issue.

the problem is that there's a bunch of old people here who think this place is a dog show or place to put their 21 cats. there's an old lady who rolls around in some wheel chair with like 5 dogs and cats and talks to them as loud as she can, and some other lady who shouts to her dog she lets loose.

i don't want to hear old ppl calling out or talking to they animals at 4, 5, and 6 am keeping me awake before i go to work everyday. especially on weekends. these old ppl think they own the place and own YOUR PLACE to where they can disrespect u like dat and if u say anything they act like u trying to be sensitive. it aint like that. there be laws against leaving ur dog to run with no leash and noise laws they ain't respecting here and i seen plenty of it to where when my lease up im moving. i didnt pay to live at a place where i get no quiet. im in school at ASU so i cant study right when here. i have to go to library all the time.

Place ain't safe. Some ppl be shot like a week ago here and ppl asking me for change and tryin to sell me drugs when i take the trash out. Messed up. Ain't no security usually but when they here they on me quick bc im black, but they ignore the drunk native with no shirt on trying to sell molly in they parking lot. Renters lives matter, but only on the day u pay ur rent to them! They treat u bad the other 30 days of the month.

Parking!! people always take my parking place here whether it be assigned or not. front office does nothing. there be water leaks springing up everywhere when pipes break and they act like that the reason u got no hot water. yea right. like i dont know whats up? they do mess with some mexican tenants but only if they male, but there a few undocumented ppl up in here they stackin apartments that get 5 star treatment and dont worry about nothin.

im an african american lady and it looks like black an white ppl get treated the same up in here: LESS. i live downstairs next to a native or hispanic girl and she told me they came and took care of same issues i had and she got the hook up. she also pay like $90 less than me for the same unit. when i moved in i had to deal with bugs. it took them 3 weeks to fix it. my homegirl next door said she try to help me and speak spanish to front office since they all mexican and maybe that help! i shouldnt have to speak spanish to be treated right here! my money still good just like urs is right?

laundry room: ppl vandalized it and i had nowhere to do laundry for a month. had to pack up th car and find a laundry place. they lock laundry up where ppl living here cant do it if u work late or get home late, but they let bad ppl mess it up and destroy machines? what r they thinking? oh, and they washers and dryers ruin 4 of my best outfits and hundreds of dollars of clothes bc they dont take care of the machines and let ppl put motor oil and bleach in washer and dryers and kids stick things in there. its nasty af and u think u got a clean one or cleaner than the ones u can see be gross, and then the clothes come out ruined. i been doing laundry elsewhere but not everybody can do that, and they ruining a lot of ppl's clothes here cuz they cheap and dont care.

theres cat vomit and dog crap some places here. if this what they want to rent to instead of me and other quiet ppl up here who aint spanish, then im just gonna go when my lease up. i know apartment complexes aint perfect but they chargin me like twice what i paid for my old place that didnt have no problems this bad. i thought i move to a nicer apt and area but no.

there heroin needles in the laundry room and parking lot too i found. i called front office and told them and they said to come in and talk to them bout it. i came by and it was like 2pm but they went to lunch and left for the day on a thursday. just bad management and i dont feel like they care about nobody unless u pay a lot of money or u speak spanish. this place is just wrong on so many levels. there other problems w/ things but that all i gonna say cause this already long."

Dabei hatten wir Гјberbackene Aubergine mit Schinken in wГјrziger Tomatensauce und gefГјllte Schweinerolladen mit Kroketten und Salat. Die Portionen waren mehr als reichlich, dass sogar noch was Гјbrig blieb. Dazu gab es noch schГ¶n gekГјhlte GetrГ¤nke. 

Am darauf folgenden Tag gingen wir noch mit zwei Begleitern dort hier. Diesmal hatten wir Gnocchi mit Gorgonzola, Salat mit Rindertranchen, Zwiebel und gebackenen SchafskГ¤se, Salat mit Putenbrust, Orange und anderen GemГјse und Penne mit DГ¶rrfleisch. 

Es hat alles sehr gut geschmeckt und auch diesmal war es fГјr diese groГџen Portionen gГјnstig. Die GetrГ¤nke waren gut gekГјhlt und zu echt guten Preisen. 

Das Ambiente und der Service war in Ordnung. Das Restaurant ist in rot TГ¶ne gehalten, mit dunklen Mobiliar und recht schick. AuГџerdem gibt es drauГџen noch einen groГџen Biergarten unmittelbar an der HauptstraГџe. Der Service war zwar etwas langsam, aber freundlich. 

Fazit: ein sehr guter Italiener und wirklich einen Besuch wert, werden auf jeden Fall hier wieder was essen gehen."

Shaw has a nice selection of house plants as well. In the summer they also have a small garden centre on the side of the building. It's an unassuming little place but worth a visit if you love keeping plants and gardening or you're the good boyfriend type."

It took him about 20mins to put it together and wrapped nicely with the vase inside a box. I was very happy with the results and the quality of the flowers. Would purchase from Bloom again.
oW92jgTVjJnX9hbk8I1reg,Ynh5YbifcFvaJRJksiF81A,"Today I fired a gun for the first time.

I think as a woman, it's important to know how to do things that people don't expect of you. My sister and father both have their gun license, and they are members at CTVSP, so they brought me along today to try out the shooting range. They each own 9mm Sig Sauer pistols,which if you're unfamiliar with guns, has a clip that holds 10 bullets. You'd be surprised how quickly you go through them...and bullets can get expensive, so remember to bring money for those, as well as targets, and to rent a gun if you don't own. Protective glasses and headphones are provided, but you will also need foam ear plugs - bring your own or buy a pair for $1. Female guests can shoot for free, but males need to pay a small fee ($10).

There are strict rules to follow on the range, and if you're unsure the range officer can help you out and let you know the basics. 

I pulled a couple images from their website because you're not supposed to take pictures in there. I had a really great time today, I shot a bulls-eye targets and silhouette targets, and I'm not half bad for my first time! It's much louder in person than I anticipated, the first time I heard someone else fire, I jumped a little. The first few shots gave me a rush of adrenaline, I can't lie. If I was still living in Montreal I would probably rush out to get my own license so that I could become a member and do this regularly. 

The facility is often used by law enforcement, security firms and others in similar fields for practice, so you know that it's good. There were a few ladies there besides my sister and I, and 1 on staff so they are female-friendly and I didn't feel at all intimidated - I totally recommend it to anyone interested in shooting for fun or looking for a new club (but do remember you need to have a license).

oMr5KXhogCwvYar0AQXWbQ,xD_p45cL63ojL57hV5g6VQ,"So, it was the evening of July 4th, and our VW bus broke down in Phoenix, Oregon. We were on our way to Washington, and we figured no one would be around to work on our vehicle. We towed it to Aaron's, and to our surprise Aaron was there after hours, lighting fireworks with his kids. He cheerfully accepted our vehicle. 

We arranged other transportation, and left our VW with Aaron. Now, from the symptoms, this could have been serious engine damage. Knowing we were from out of town, a less reputable shop might have run up the bill. We were very happy when we spoke to Doah, the shop manager, who told us the problem was a simple $40 fan switch.  On top of that, Doah took the stack of wedding announcements from our glovebox and mailed them for us, adding stamps himself!

Our VW is running fine. I recommend Aaron's to anyone traveling through southern Oregon in need of an honest and knowledgeable mechanic."

DZ0hUkFyvaPr6kDaB1v9Wg,XvvfgHGu49zYbtVRgq5fNw,"I rented an awesome 56 foot houseboat at Don Pedro for a weekend and had an awesome time. The boat was comfortable, well stocked and a ton of fun. The staff at Don Pedro marina were awesome. They were friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. We were a bit nervous about piloting such a huge boat, but the staff was so helpful and set everyone at ease. Anchoring the boat was simple with the instructions that were given and this was one of the most memorable family trips we've taken. Everyone on board from 2 years old to 60 years old had a blast!
The only reason I cannot give a 5 star review is that the Houseboating.org information did not give an address or instructions on how to get to the marina or locate the boat on the day of our arrival which resulted in frustration starting our trip off. The lake is large and there are several camping areas and more than one marina. There was not a single sign for houseboat rentals or forever resorts! We were finally able to find the marina thanks to a helpful park ranger. I would highly recommend some signage or at least detailed information in the emails to future renters."

TxJCpcWVqSluQoNxFO_WQA,HPbEAkKXgmzZRAIw5_zjEg,"I can't attest to the service department since I have not been there yet, but the one star reviews are a huge understatement to how wonderful this dealer is. It doesn't hurt to go up and ask questions instead of waiting for someone to find you and read your mind. Then again, I'm someone who prefers to walk into a business and let me search around and ask questions on my own if I need to instead of being tackled by a sales person.

My experience with this dealership started when my husband and I moved to the area and found out we needed to re-take a motorcycle riding certification course in order to be able to ride our motorcycles on military bases. We already have our motorcycle license/endorsements, and every single returning rider or basic riding 2 course was booked in the area, so we decided to just re-take the basic riding course again. I was emailing back and forth with their riding academy rep and found out we did not qualify for the special $99 military riding course rate, but she was able to still offer us a generous 50% military discount from their actual regular course rate. And just to note, their course rate not only includes instruction and coaching in the classroom and field, but it includes beverages, snacks, and lunch on ALL days (dinner if it is a night class), and plenty of small gifts such as a gift card, books, stickers, key chain, etc. 

I also had the pleasure of meeting the female owner of the dealership when I came in to sign up for the riding course, and it shows that she takes so much pride and dedication in her employees and dealership. I had walked into a different Harley Davidson dealership just a few weeks prior, and it was NOTHING compared to how I was treated here. Every single person I came into contact with here was courteous, friendly, and very professional. They definitely set the bar high for the Harley Davidson image. Like a previous reviewer said, it definitely is a family-owner business and it shows in every single employee. 

Terrie and Dominic were our instructors for the riding course. We've taken an MSF course in California before and the instructors are like drill sergeants barking orders at you down the field and waiving their hands at you to go away or get back in line when you screw up. Terrie and Dominic's approach allowed even the most inexperienced and frustrated new riders to walk away with confidence in their abilities and fundamental skills to remember in order to succeed out on the road. They do not yell, they don't have attitudes, and when you screw up, they calmly walk you through it, coach you on what you did wrong and what you can do to improve it, and give you a pat on the back, which (believe it or not) will help your confidence when you go back and try again knowing that it's OKAY that you messed up, hence the purpose and importance of practicing with them on the field. Even as experienced riders, my husband and I walked away learning new skills and techniques to improve our riding skills, and our experience and interaction with everyone here was such a great pleasure. I highly recommend the riding course academy at this dealership.

Note: This review is my opinion based on my experience only and may not reflect on the business as a whole. What experience I had may not be the same for someone else."

He is also pretty quick.  My son gets a ""high and tight""  and it's nice not having to explain what that is or worry about one side being higher than the other.  He knows what he's doing and even finishes off with warm shaving cream and a straight razor...  Which my son loves.  You won't be disappointed."
uIPCRKIuq4aSVmsWgAa6tA,pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w,"This place is located within a health store called Noah's (way at the back).  They have a good size ""buffet"" bar where you pay by weight plus soups, wraps and some snacks.  The buffet bar is $2.60/100g which is average by Toronto standards, but pricey by mine.  However, the food is quite good and seems to be prepared daily and very fresh.  They have an assortment of salads, cabbage rolls, tofu and lentil inspired dishes.  I've tried their hot dishes twice and also had a samosa.  While I loved the food, the problem is that it isn't very warm or piping hot and the samosa I had was practically frozen and no offered to warm it up for me.  

I might visit again, but only if I'm passing by.  It's great takeout food, not necessarily food you want if you want to eat something there before a workout or something."
_80vznYut7O0Vq6F5-95Zw,Nr2uHirba5WNcG0vOXoVDA,"I've been a ChocoSol customer for quite a few years now. I first discovered them at my local farmers' market, where they pedal-power a cart selling warm drinking chocolate that is dairy-free, some of their bars, coffee and even vegan cookies. They now have expanded into making fresh tortilla and grilling up one sweet and one savoury tortilla, both of which are vegetarian and the savoury can be made vegan through the omission of cheese. 

Over the years, they've really improved on the quality and presentation of their cacao products in my opinion. I come from a chocolate retailing background, as well as a cacao-growing ancestral history so I've been familiar with the pod to bean to bar process since I was a child. 

Last Friday, I got to check out their new factory space near Dufferin & Dupont. They're hosting weekly chocolate workshops leading up to Christmas. The 'chocolate-making workshop' title on my ethicalDeal voucher was a bit of a misnomer. We didn't actually make any chocolate, nor was it really a workshop. 

So, why the heck am I giving it 5 stars? It was a really great evening examining the chocolate-making process at ChocoSol, from beans to bar, and from farmer in Mexico to cold and grey Toronto. We also got to sample everything from their freshly Vitamixed warm drinking chocolate, which has vastly improved over the years, to their raw and roasted cacao and all the different flavours of bars.

Everything they do at ChocoSol is done with sustainability in mind. They only receive one order of beans per year. They only have one winnowing machine, one conching machine. They do solar power roasting whenever the sun is out. All they get to all their markets, Dufferin Grove, Wychwood via bicycle. Really, you can not get more granola and they know it!

All their cacao products are dairy-free (save the tortillas at the markets, but they don't sell those here) and they are expanding their line to include other sustainable local foods like organic hemp seeds. Their chocolates are also gluten-free, and nut-free to accomodate for just about every common food allergen. Their hemp seed bar was my absolute favourite, followed very closely by the coconut and the vanilla.

If you're used to eating only chocolate confectionary aka candy bars, then you might not have the palate for this. It truly is a something you acquire, just like how McDonald's consumers don't tend to like vegetables, your tastebuds need to have the sensitivity to enjoy the richness of dark chocolate with minimal sugar content and zero artificial flavours. Most candy chocolates also contain hydrogenated oils, also know as transfats, and just about a zillion other additives, sometimes even food colour(always read labels, folks)! Yes, the crap from the grocery store, **nodding** even that Laura Secord and Godiva stuff at the mall has it. Why do you think this stuff can sit on a shelf for years on end and not expire? Anyway, you won't find any of that here. This tour has actually stole my top chocolate local, fair trade chocolate endorsement from Camino.

ChocoSol, you've won over my chocolatey heart!

I stocked up on great stocking stuffers like drinking chocolate pucks, wrapped bars, even Karmalicious cocoa butter bath bars, as well as a stack of unwrapped bars for myself. Keep with the sustainability theme, if you bring your own container, you get a discount on the unwrapped bars.

They have holiday discount and gift packs promotion on for a limited time. Check it out: http://chocosol.posterous.com/theyre-here-chocosol-holiday-giftthrift-packs"
DKpxxXm7a_hJlV6KNyUFPg,RSAHZjr2yPZHZ-HhrgCrXQ,"So, I rowed way back in high school and when I moved to Cleveland last summer I thought I might want to take it up again.  Well, things got a little busy and before I knew it I was bogged down with work and school.  Thanks to Cara for posting up the Learn to Row info up on Yelp and giving me that little extra push to head down there now that I have more time.  The LTR program goes over one day (about 7:30 - 2) and covers everything beginners need to know about rowing on the river in Cleveland (and it also reminds a few of us who have done it before of things we may have forgotten).  A little bit of a classroom session with Erik and then down for a boathouse tour and some work on the erg's before hitting the water.

The boathouse is beautiful.....and they just moved in a little while ago after the old boathouse burned down.  They have a lot of room here and are working hard to improve the area and make it into a Riverfront Park that everyone can enjoy.  Lots of room for boats (so many places row out of here: high schools, colleges and universities along with the master rowers and private members).  The only thing that I wish the boathouse had, is a nice indoor rowing tank, then it would be complete!

For the rest of the day, you'll be out on the water in your 8 with a couple of experienced rowers and a coxswain along with your coach alongside in the launch.  They'll teach you everything basic about getting the boat in and out of the water and the fundamentals of the stroke.....and how not to get run over or swamped by the 7-story high ships that come down the Cuyahoga!

After such a fantastic day out on the water, I knew I had to sign up for the rest of the summer....these people are fantastic, in reality, it seems more like the Hash House Harriers...they're a ""social club with a rowing problem"".  The group camaraderie was so amazing that I even convinced a fellow Yelper to join up with me too....and I anticipate an excellent summer out on the water!

I love looking at beautiful and unique shoes. Some of them are almost like work of art. I however, prefer function  over aesthetic.  1 hr in high heel I am begging for mercy. I have friends who will endure blisters and bleeding and paying big bucks to the cobblers to make a pair of shoes fit. They put foam or lifter and spreader to expand and adjust the positions.

I, on the other hand, have sworn off heels. I love my comfort and ease. 

It was the ""surprise sale""that drew me to fluevog in the distillery district. I was immediately drawn by the beautiful lines of the design. They are unique, funky but not outrageous. The material look very sturdy and high quality. That's something about the colours of their shoes that scream luxury.

There are not many kitten heels, which I tend to avoid. Yet while the heels with this design tend to be chunky, they are decorated with some details to make them stand out. I tried a few on found them to be very comfortable. Sadly I could only buy one but I think I am ready to start a shoe collection!"

The house was a mess when we moved in and even though it was suppose to be a pet free property there were piles of hair in the corner from the previous family's Great Dane. When we call and talked to Todd (the owner) he called is liars. 

Things just got worse from there. They lost rent checks, never told us they lost them and then would back date the late fee and only tell us when it reached 500. They refused to fix the water heater, they wouldn't send on HOA notices and so we get fined.

At one point in time I was told that they needed to ""speak to the man on my relationship"" and then hung up on me. If I ever answered the phone after that I was told ""the discussion was not for me"". 

These truly are the worst people I have ever worked with. If you need to pay twice as much to live somewhere that is not managed by them - do it!! Anything is better than what we went through."

The rates are very, very reasonable, I'm so glad I got the chair so I got to see most of the show.
Because we were at a hotel, they said to just leave it with the concierge and they would pick it up after the 4 days free. I think that's a great service.  The chair was not grungy...in good condition and clean.
They will definitely get my business again if the need arises."
zi0G4rXG2pQJ77KOwnjwYQ,C9avSG4QShJPcXlRvqObNw,I can't speak to the quality of service of the actual business because I have never been inside. Partly because when I first moved here a few months back I saw someone had thrown a brick through their window. Upset someone much? I went today to publix which has a public parking lot that they share and got the nastiest look from the lady inside. Turns out they have a sign on a dry eraser board that ask for you to leave that one space for their establishment. Okay...Great... the sign was not out it was inside the dry cleaners. She waits until I come back out of publix maybe 15 minutes later to put the sign out. Bitter much? You really want to be passive aggressive with a potential new client? Find something better to do with your time than pick on an 8 month pregnant woman(Why I chose the closest spot to publix in a PUBLIC lot).  Seriously. Better yet pay to have an actual sign placed there like other business' have paid to do.

Then (after saying the outside unit was perfect) they said I needed a new compressor for $3100. Called someone else for a second opinion and got it fixed for $100.

DO NOT trust this company to move/pack your belongings unless you want to have to buy all new furniture.  I recently used them for my move and they damaged nearly all of my furniture pieces, some of which are antiques.  One chair is broken to the point where it's unusable.  When I called to complain, Evan, hung up on me twice and told me he'd see me in court rather than attempting to make it right or even saying that he'd talk to the movers who packed my stuff.  I know there is inherent risk in moving but this damage was due to negligent packing and handling.

The initial service was good,  but after the final installment was paid there was a huge lack of customer service. Also during the project there was some lack of coordination and communication with the work to be done. First they subcontracted the painting of the rocks, but the people they hired never asked for our input on how we wanted the pattern of the paint to be like, we had expected that it they would merely be the same pattern that already existed. We weren't too fond of what the new pattern looked like. Then they painted our rocks prior to the tile being installed, which created a void in the paint on the rocks, which still exists now.  We tried numerous times on contacting them to have this resolved. Each time they responded that they would get back to us, but unfortunately that never occurred. Finally it was agreed that they would make sure the pool's chemical balance was okay for 30 days post project completion, but they never came back out to check on that."

And that's not because the job was easy. In fact, our home had some structural limitations from hardwiring our security cameras that made it difficult compared to most other jobs. But James and Juan came in each day, on time, ready to work and explain all my options to me. Even when I had changed my mind about the location of the cameras, they kept a positive attitude and worked their tails off to make sure everything went off without a hitch.

They are extremely accessible, knowledgeable, and professional. Making an appointment is easy, and you're given email reminders right away. You rarely meet businesses that really excel in customer service, and they have set the bar extremely high."

FXDNp7mQTDEQWKZnlNIkpA,YoNIzx1YqeFrdtSbMpH6jQ,"I have been seeing Dr Griego for about 10 years now and love her! She's wonderful and takes great care of my eyes. She's honest and up-front, always happy and friendly, and very knowledgeable. She even does newborn screenings and is wonderful with our special needs son - who loves his glasses and her office! 

The front office staff is usually pleasant however they seem to have a high turn over rate with only Cindy being around as long as I have been going there. I feel like every year when I go in there is someone new training who is not very knowledgeable about the office processes and frames. That being said, we've had wonderful experiences with our children and getting replacement lenses when scratches occur!

My only real negative comment is the lack of frame selection. For the last 4 years I have not been able to find what I am looking for with minimal options in the office. This year I actually bought my frames online and LOVE what I got however when I went to the office to have them adjusted behind my ears I was told they would not help me if I didn't purchase the frames at the office (I had no problem when I walked in to a random office elsewhere with no questions asked). My husband has not gotten frames at the office for the last 3 years since he can never find what he wants. When it comes to kid frames, my 3 were extremely happy with the selection and we get more compliments on our son's glasses than I can count! He has a pair of Solo Bambini glasses and they are amazing!

Overall, I recommend Dr Griego to any and everyone, but for frame selection you may want to get your script and look elsewhere."

Staff are extremely lazy, personally very rude and unwelcoming. Have been to this wishful a handful of times, sample tea canisters are usually either near empty or have been sitting there for hours. The lady who was trying to sell me some tea had very low product knowledge; in fact kept score on how many cups each person drank, reminding potential customers to only take one serving. Most likely due to the laziness of not wanting to brew another batch. 

Seeing as these teas are about $11.00-$12.00 per 50g and I'm guaranteed to spend quite a chunk load of money on tea even if I buy a small batch, doubt it's wise to annoy your customers. Other stores are definitely 4 stars, this one deserves 1."

I called them twice to make sure that my primary insurance is accepted there because they dont accept my secondary insurance. They said they do accept my primary insurance, so I made an appointment and my husband and I took an extra day off at work so we can all go including our children's eye exam. So when we get there, they said my they don't accept my insurance. I got really upset coz I took the time off at work. Since my 2 kids are under my husband insurance, they went ahead for an eye exam. I told them my son is getting glasses and contact lenses. They gave me the prescription for the glasses but NOT for the contact lenses. I was really mad coz I already paid them and my kids got culinary insurance. Dr. Kent Helmick and his employees got the WORST customer service and they're NOT doing their job right. I have my rights to get my son's prescription and they DECLINED it!!! WORST experience and we are regular customers there for a very LONG TIME and I will NEVER go back there again and NEVER EVER spend my money on them again.  BEWARE guys don't ever go to Dr Kent Helmick. I will only buy my glasses there from Visionworks itself coz the employees that works there are the best  but NOT the Doctor's office. PLEASE avoid going to Dr. Kent Helmick. It was really sad on my part that I have been going there for 17 yrs but now they just lost a loyal customers."

hm_9fXPdQgPffJP5btjVbg,pMefTWo6gMdx8WhYSA2u3w,"Okay, I'm a guy, I live by myself and work anywhere between 45-60 hours a week, add on 2 hours of commute time and sleeping time, that means I barely have any time to clean my condo.  I try to do it once a week, but sometimes it ends up being once every 2-3 weeks and can result in some massive chaos.  That massive chaos finally made me give in and call a cleaning service.  

The first one that popped up and I knew of was Merry Maids.  They charge $45/hour/cleaner.  They said they would arrive between 12 and 1 and arrived exactly at 1.  Good and on-time.   Definite plus.  So here's a summary of the pros and cons:

Pros:
-On time, friendly
-Did a bang up job on the bathroom.  Was very impressed.  
-Finally got the baseboards clean (I struggle with those)
-Even cleaned the inside of my microwave though I thought they were only cleaning the outside.
-They said ""your condo isn't that bad. We've seen 10X worse"".  Wohoo!  I'm not a total slob!!!  *pats himself on the back*
-Overall, very good job

Cons:
-There were two people, so it came to $90/hour.  Kind of pricey imo, but I've never used a cleaning service.  

Verdict: If you need to have a spic and span place for guests and are willing to shell out the dough, then go for it.  Wouldn't do it weekly, but maybe monthly."

It was not until I got home did I realize that the receipt was on the floor in my car.  I read the receipt and it ""seems"" everything in my car was leaking, my oil, my transmission, and my power steering.  What's funny, is neither of the mechanics found it necessary to mention that to me.  What is also more interesting is IF my car was leaking from all of those areas, would not there be a leak in my clean garage on the floor?  On the floor where I park my car at work?  I had a friend check my car and he saw NO LEAKS at all.  I find this to be highly dishonest.  I wrote an email to complain about this so called service and told them I wanted my money back, but they insisted that they did a good job; and would NOT refund my money. I would never go there again, and I would suggest that you don't either.  With so many honest mechanics out there why use a dishonest one?    Their dishonest, rude and not respectful.

I flew in to see Dr. Marlow from LOS ANGELES CA in hopes of a positive experience.I have never felt so uncomfortable and disrespected as I did at this office. Let me explain:

The receptionist named Shirley was rude, dishonest, and just plain disrespectful.
I have never witnessed such poor behavior in a professional setting.

Over the phone Shirley MISCOMMUNICATED the payment plan to me.
I arrived at the office and was unprepared to pay for services at that time because of what Shirley had told me earlier that morning. She denied ever speaking with me and had insinuated I was lying and that I must have called the wrong number.
Thankfully I had proof on my cell phone of when I had called the office that morning. After bringing that to her attention she failed to recognize she was in the wrong and didn't' apologize.
*Payment wasn't the issue. It was about the principal and poor treatment that upset me. 

Since I wasn't planning on paying for services that day I had to leave the office and run to the ATM. After I returned ten minutes later she said she would have to RESCHEDULE my appointment because I had ran to the ATM. 
I arrived to my appointment ON TIME but because of HER mistake I was being held accountable. That was totally unacceptable! Had she FORGOT (once again) that I flew in from Los Angeles for that one appointment. I have a job and didn't plan on staying in Charlotte any longer than planned.  So she informed me that I could stay in the waiting room and be seen if a patient didn't show up. So for the rest of my duration in the waiting room I filled out my paperwork and was treated coldly to put it lightly. * She was very short in her answers regarding paperwork. 

Finally I saw Dr. Marlow for a brief time. It was a very UNCOMFORTABLE experience for a doctors visit in which I haven't experienced in my lifetime. 
He rarely made eye contact with me and was very short with questions and answers. How did he expect me to openly converse with him about my health needs if he was conducting himself in such a closed off  manner. 
Anyhow after the appointment I was happy to be leaving and on my way back to LA. I have since found a NEW doctor who is compassionate, honest, and a great listener. 

My new doctor needed some paperwork faxed over from Dr. Marlows office.
I called and politely asked Shirley if she could please fax over the paperwork.
Her response was short like usual. I asked her when should I be expecting the paperwork. She said MAYBE Friday if they got to it. I was calling on a Tuesday.
WHAT A JOKE! It takes 2 minutes to fax over paper work. The receptionist here in LA even noted how ""unhelpful"" she was when contacting her.
I understand offices are busy but when I was in the waiting room for 2 hours I saw one other client. It all goes back to PRINCIPAL. If she had good intentions and was kind hearted this wouldn't even be an issue. God bless her miserable soul and I am RELIEVED to be free of of having to be in contact with that office. 


If you are contemplating on whether or not to see Dr. Marlow I suggest you save your energy, money, and time. 

If you are seeking a doctor for HRT feel free to contact me and I can share with you my doctor."

The bad. . . Flavors. Regardless of the premium appearance, their flavors aren't tasteful and unique, like most premium flavors- they are designed to pull people from smoking. I respect and understand the need, but this concept is for tobacco stores. For these prices, I expect well crafted flavors, not what technically is juice.

Within the recent months, the good corporation of McDonald's Restaurants decided that operating 24/7 in selected locations would be a great a idea. God have mercy on the poor souls of the employees that still work in this location at the late hours of Thurs-Fri-Sat

I mean it, I would've quit the moment I learned that I would have to deal with drunkards fresh off the mating grounds..err...dance floor.

When we walked in the lineup was already long and was in complete disarray, and the only thing keeping the rowdy drunks at bay was a friendly old lady wearing a security jacket. Clearly she was the night shift manager trying to establish a presence of importance. I will give her points for doing a good job in preventing the place from turning into post apocalyptic raider's camp.

So while, ordering and getting food was a little annoying, eating it was just as annoying. Mickie-D food is Mickie-d food, it's the same everywhere and staff are trained to make Big Macs under any nature of duress. So by default, it was good. But the dining experience itself was annoying, which begs the questions ""why didn't we just get the food to go?"" and to that I reply ""it doesn't matter, shut up"". For security reasons, they made sure that every door except the main entrance made a LOUD alarm that made people think something was on fire, when it truth, it was just Glenda going out the back for her smoke."

The sound effects and walk through static displays moved me. I suggest coming here during the week so you can take in the place alone. Don't let a big group sway you from being in the moment. Leave your phone in the car and really let this place touch you. I had no idea how much I didn't know about the plight of Native Americans when it came to the systematic attempt of the government to solve what it called its 'Indian problem'.

Sadly, I did not splurge for this fine delicacy, but it's definitely worth a look around in their shop for all you cheese aficionados.  The employees looked bored, but I think I would be too...I mean they just cut the cheese all day long.... (pun intended)  ;)

My real grievance with this location is the level of training and professionalism the that the few staff members employed at this location tend to show. To start with not paying attention to customers. For Example I re-loaded my card, And the computer acknowledged it. The barista however did not. Also the baristas need to start telling customers to share the space. For example I've seen people have most of the big table occupied with their things taking up space for others at this table.

They have a few vegetarian options and I ordered the cold noodle salad.  It was around $6.75 (I think) and the portion was probably good for a small lunch or large snack (depending on how much you eat).  

The tofu and the veggies were fresh and the sauce was good too.  Food came out in less than 2 minutes and the service is very friendly. If I'm in the area, I'd definitely go back."

Instead of cute, reasonable, furniture pieces, people stock their booths with chatckis, dolls, plates and really nothing remotely close to sellable.  It belongs at Goodwill, not in a vintage marketplace.

I just left this place, empty-handed, again.  It needs a complete overhaul of space, PRESENTATIONS AND PRODUCT.  Ditch the toys and junk.

I was pretty excited to have it magically transform into a beautiful piece of art that I could show off to potential employers. 

Except when I walked in the door, I was greeted by less than friendly staff. I didn't expect to be given a tiara and a glass of champagne, but I think I stood at the counter for 10 minutes before someone helped me. Then the guy who served me kind of gave me the ""yah? What do you want"" routine and so I coyly suggested I have some of the pages redone and the cover re-bound. I asked if he suggest I do anything else and he said he didn't know. 

He then swiftly took my stuff away and came back 15 minutes later with my semi-new portfolio in hand. He rang up what I owed him while answering a phone call. He didn't look at me or have the courtesy to call the guy back while he finished serving me. I left feeling deflated that I hadn't asked for more help or been more assertive, but I didn't have the energy. 

Shouldn't these people WANT to help you? WANT to make something look professional and beautiful that you'd be proud of, and then, presumably, you'd suggest their services to your friends (or potential employers?)

s_QdsTRboXMZp6c8VKtwmQ,7s0EXUCGMBAu-Odc6iC5rQ,"Taking my 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee (3.0 Ltr Diesel) to Canadian Import Auto was the best thing I ever did... and it saved me thousands of dollars. Literally. 

I had previously taken my jeep to the dealership where I bought it - Renfrew Chrysler. My jeep had a persistent oil leak coming from underneath the engine somewhere. After leaving my jeep with Renfrew Chrysler for four days, all they could tell me is they ""thought"" it was an oil pan leak or my rear main seal - quote - $3,500 to pull the motor and repair the rear main seal. 

I left Renfrew Chrysler with ZERO confidence in their ability to help me. 

I then used Facebook to crowd source my network - ""who would you recommend to do mechanical work on a Jeep with the 3.0 Ltr Mercedes Diesel?"" 

Richard and Canadian Import Auto was one of the recommendations by a friend who's mother takes her Mercedes for service. 

I drop off my Jeep and in less then 10 minutes of being up on a hoist, Richard knew exactly where the leak was coming from... and why. 

Richard said he could easily drop the transmission to fix the rear main seal. Renfrew Chrysler said they would have to pull the motor to explore where the leak was coming from... pardon? 

After a closer look, Richard found more leaks, fixed them all. At the same time he checked my glow plugs - they were quite corroded. He replaced those too. 

New seals, air filter, oil filter, oil and transmission fluids, and glow plugs... all in for less than Renfrew's quote. 

On the test drive, Richard heard an unusual noise coming from the engine. Long story short, it was the jeeps turbo. It was faulty and needed to be replaced. Renfrew Chrysler quoted $7000 just for the turbo. Richard made a few calls and found a reconditioned one for $1800. 

Richard and his technicians were nothing but professional and accommodating. His communication throughout the entire service and experience was fantastic and timely. 

I will never service my jeep at Renfrew Chrysler again, nor will I buy from them or refer them. 

I am forever grateful to Richard and his team. I highly recommend."

A word of advice: if you hate dealing with the public, do the public a favour and don't work in the service industry!

I've been to an actual BBW outlet that housed all the old school and last season fragrances. No matter though, they had what I wanted.

Brought to you by the EPA & and some anti-car leftists that fail to accept science.

The service here is a joke, the mandate to be forced to use this service is not a laughing matter, instead, it's sad. 

In an effort to placate to the program's many critics, state legislators agreed to have tax payers pick up the testing tab in 2006, to keep their big scam alive.

They've tied my hands into using the self service kiosk, which proves everyone's point that this program is an embarrassment, and a tribute to public policy gone wrong.  The Twinsburg kiosk failed twice requiring an employee to manually enter the vehicle ID, but still saved me from entering their testing station.

One brilliant caveat to the program is that if you register your vehicle outside the 7-county area surrounding Cleveland, you're exempt from testing, because apparently your car doesn't harm the environment as much as everyone else's.

The icing on the cake: if repairs are too expensive after failed tests, you're exempt, as the liberals can't have eCheck hurting the poor with costly vehicle repairs. So the environment still suffers."

I'll be honest, it was my mistake by not walking out as soon as I walked in.

The barber was glued to court tv, and eating his lunch when I happened upon his business.

Not only was the haircut average at best, but the conversation sucked, and the big one for me: no straight razor shave.  Thank God they don't attempt straight razor shaves here because I'd probably walk out with the hiv.

They refuse to return their poor quality items which are defected! WITH ORIGINAL RECEIPT!!! Days after purchase!! Yes they've been worn ONCe! But how else would we really find out if they are waterproof?? Or defected? Just by looking at them? 
Winter boots which are advertised as waterproof online are certainly NOT! 
My children were left with wet feet and a cold! Days after the purchase! 
They gave me such a hard time - refused the return. Would not give me names of people I was speaking to! Told
Me to call customer service- which request you pay for shipping and wait for someone to analyze whether the boot is ACTUALLY DEFECTED. So your basically forced to spend more money, and are left with no product and NO refund?!? 
Completely ridiculous!
Their quality of their clothes is low and now I finally have learned the reason why they always have 50%-70% discounts on their It's to get rid of their stuff! Cuz no one will ever want to pay full price!
I know I NEVER WILL AGAIN!"

I went to great clips right down the street from me and big mistake, made a mess out of my hair

Then I found this location and Kristen took me before I was even able to sit down.

I explained to Kristen what the Great Clips h c did and not only did she listen intently, I showed her the obvious mess and she took her time and cleaned up my hair perfectly, 

Kristen asked me if I wanted my eye brows done and other places cut.

She may be young, but Kristen takes pride in her work.

Kristen made me look like a million dollars, will see her until I leave Az

Well , I saw Kristen for the last time, only because I am moving back to Florida in 1.5 weeks. I had her shave me, a first for me.

Perfect job, expected nothing less from Kristen. I told her I only had 1 regret, and that is I didnt find her ealier when I move into where I live.

If there was a perfect 10, Kristen not only deserves it, but also a raise.

I will miss Kristen, she made sure ro make everything perfect."

I like QT. Gas is generally better than competiive for the local area. This one in particular is in SC with lower gas tax so if you are in the area, you can save a bit.

However wish they had choice of real naan instead of just reheated pita bread.  
Food is ordered at the counter and delivered to your table.  Seems like more and more of these casual restaurants are going to this format of order and pay first.  I'm guessing that they may have trouble seating everyone during prime times so be prepared to take out if no seats available.

The kids are given so many opportunities to explore their areas of interest. It's a great environment, filled with kids who truly want to learn and better themselves. The brains, talent and dedication exhibited by not only the students, but the staff as well, is very impressive. On top of it being a great school, academically, they offer so many extra curricular activities and clubs for the students to explore. The administration is top notch as well. Mr. Synold is open, honest and makes parent's input and involvement feel welcomed. The school also offers plenty of support and opportunities for parents and students to gather information about preparing testing for college. 
I'd highly recommend A-tech for any motivated student who wants an edge going into the work field and college."
UvKoGBUCrzI1TmAIVu9VYw,_Pv-sqQ0xWC70yReVcaPEw,"Poor business practice!  I posted a comment on here yesterday about the crappy service I received in Fort Lauderdale at the kiosk in the Galleria Mall, but Ghost Armor continues to remove it when I repost, obviously to cover up any negative practices so the only thing that people see here on their Facebook page is the good stuff.  Too bad that the posting wasn't left for people to understand that the full disclosure isn't being provided, prior to closing the sale, as to how the replacement plan works.  The kids who work at the kiosk in Fort Lauderdale pitch the product, but they DON'T tell you that you have to return the old Ghost Armor film to get the next new one for $5.00.  So, I go to get the new one after the old one had been removed and I'm told that I'm out of luck.  The guy was really rude and blew me off with an attitude.  I contacted the corporate office and was told that I should have read the fine print on the sales receipt (buyer beware, they tell you all the seemingly good stuff, but don't tell you the important stuff).  So they pitch the sale and suck you in and then you're on your own.  Very bad, and it felt like part of the excuse from the Corp office was that the Florida mall kiosks are privately owned, but if I would go home, get online, complete a registration process, then call the corp office back again they would issue a warranty or something, then GO BACK to the mall to the rude punk... yeah right, I don't think so, for a piece of plastic!

I would NEVER return to a Ghost Armor location or purchase this product EVER again.  If the corporate office blames the privately owned franchises and don't hold them to a high standard, then the problem is at the corporate level.

Let's see how long this post is left before they remove it again.  Well it lasted 4 minutes the last time.  Ghost Armor is removing my post as soon as I repost it because they refuse to let anyone say anything negative, instead of resolving the issue, they prefer to hide a single complaint.  Bad business practice again Ghost Armor.  You brag about your product, but don't stand by good policy and allow your franchise operators to tarnish your reputation, which I don't think there is much of a reputation here because if anyone says anything negative you remove it.  Sneaky and disreputable."

Mens obviously has a better selection and they do have cool knic knack products and better buying for mens clothes.  i saw some beer holster, and thought that was pretty groovy.
Otherwise, I think they need to step up their fashion game for women.  Its a little simplistic.  not trendy enough?  People do like simple clothes, don't get me wrong, but one has to see the value.  Just because it says muttonhead on it, doesn't necessarily give me value.  Value to me would be....reasonably priced in comparison to the same commodity elsewhere, and...i dunno why is muttonhead so greaT?  hard for the customer to be informed by some random name of a brand....without any explanation.

They've got a great mix across the board, stocking large quantities of the big box beers and wine, with a big enough selection of interesting beer wine and liquor to keep it, well, interesting.

While the main store in Crowfoot is a liquor super centre, this location is a little more like a general store. The selection is much smaller but they still do an impressive job at keeping the right products on hand so you can stop here for something craft or something common.

The staff are friendly, mature and  knowledgeable enough about their products to set them apart from any other liquor stores on 14th Street. 

While not high enough on the awesome scale to be one of Calgary's great destination liquor locations, this Crowfoot Liquor isn't trying to be. It's your best bet if you live in the area and a great place to pick up an impressive bottle of vino on you way to a party.

See you soon!"

I just recently contacted him because my auto insurance rates were once again going up and this time by $17! This after it had gone up around $3 or so the year before. Since nothing had changed i.e. no tickets, no accidents, etc. I didn't quite understand. So what did Erik do? Work his magic for me once again. He got me the exact same policy at a different agency for $27 less a month. SCORE!!!!!!!  He knows how ""special"" I can be as a client so if he can put up with me, I know can handle anyone.

RyupMPEgqaIW2abzMw2TLw,QWAkTDNWwlmRsgHv13YnHw,"I went to Lammle's (not this exact location) to be outfitted with Western wear with a company team for a promotional event during the Calgary Stampede. While the manager was friendly and welcoming, the employees only did the bare minimum and looked irritated when asked for help and shoe sizes; it made most of my team just want to get what they needed and get out as fast as possible. The employees were told that the entire team were from the city and 9/10 of us had never worn Western boots or hats before. If the staff knew this, they should have educated us more on how to wear leather boots and what sizes we should choose! Instead, I was left to look for a pair of boots by myself and when I asked a girl for help she looked at the boots on my feet and asked if they were tight. At the time I felt that they were snug and she said they would stretch so that was most likely the best size. Had she checked closer and given better customer service, she would have known that they were way too small and would not stretch at all- in fact, they caused bruising on my feet! Leather cowboy boots fit much differently than what I'm used to; flats and sandals.

Most of my team mates were outfitted with the wrong hat size and boot sizes and just 'put up with it' for the duration of the Stampede or didn't get to wear any of their purchases. When I went back to the store to discuss an exchange or return, the manager was kind enough to call one of the head office supplies managers for me because their initial policy is that they do not do returns or refunds. However, I felt that I was not treated right as a customer and I was robbed of my first Western experience and getting Western boots. At first, I could hear her refusing to talk to me. I could hear her through the phone saying, ""No way. I don't think so. I'm not speaking to her."" Finally, after telling the manager I heard her remarks, I got her on the phone and she said, ""We never get complaints about our customer service."" and told me, ""You're wrong,"" And when I touched on the subject about being fitted poorly by incompetent staff, she replied, ""When people complain about not being fitted properly, we tell them the same thing I'm telling you.."" So she just admitted that people DO complain and that she is rude to everyone else who is a customer. This woman was absolutely horrid and THEN, she hung up on me! I then decided to call another manager at the head office. The receptionist cut me off mid-sentence, was short and rude to me. She forwarded me to a woman's voicemail and I left a message. I never received a phone call back. I also e-mailed Lammle's twice with no response. 

This place was the worst shopping experience I've ever had in my life and I would never ever go back. Even though I was upset, I kept an even tone the entire time- no voices were raised. In hindsight, I wish I had caused a bit of mayhem because I can't believe that they are a ""successful"" chain- how that happened, I have no idea. The Calgary Stampede should be ashamed that they allow Lammle's to be the Calgary Stampede official wear."

I like this BoA because it has more parking than most any other.  Especially with spots right near the front door.

The people working here are by far the friendliest I have ever encountered.  They make polite comments and sometimes a good joke.  The kind of people you wouldn't mind running into at a bar and saying ""hi.""

They have one of those electronic live tellers - it is a real person but they are far away and they talk to you through the computer screen.  I call them SATMs because I feel like I am using a Skype ATM.

Be careful about bringing in Canadian coins - I had a few in my random change and they spotted all of them and wouldn't take them, even the pennies.  That is fair but I was trying to get rid of all my change.  They do take Canadian bills.

On the negative side there are usually two or three people working in the bank but only one of them is working the teller window.  You could have three or four people ahead of you in line and you see people in the bank not working this line.  If you are a supreme or premiere member they do special things for you like let you cut the line or take care of your deposits for you.

The service is quite friendly but the work is terrible. I have my nails done regularly and will not come back here after how bad my french gel looks--lopsided, uneven and lumpy. I had them fix a few problems but they didn't see many I pointed out. And they filled my sister's nails and they turned out horribly: the old gel they left behind lifted afterward so her nail beds were white and swirly. They said afterward that they should have removed the old gel first instead of filling them, but they never made that suggestion to us beforehand; which I find odd, since a new set would have cost more than a fill. They offered to cover her nails with a thin coat of glitter gel, which covered it a bit, but it's certainly not worth $40. Will not be back."
ql6gLdpqKdn8tGs2PTWOhg,6lwtMLkEL1unLGSnJK8ZXw,"* This review was also posted on Thumbtack.com, which is the website that I located this service through. 

Honestly, I was shocked at the experience we had with E&A after reading all the 5-star reviews. I scheduled our service for a 12:30-1:30pm arrival window on a Sunday. On Saturday morning, I was called and asked if the window could shift to 3pm-4pm. A 1.5hr shift in time was no big deal. But then 4pm came around and still no movers and no call with an update. I had to call at 4:30pm to find out where the movers were. I had people helping us with the smaller boxes and we were waiting for the movers to load the heavier furniture items that I wouldn't be able to help with. I received a call back at 5pm with an update that the movers would arrive by 6pm. Still didn't happen. And the stories that I was given over the phone were not the same stories the movers who actually came to our house gave us. At 6:15pm, the movers finally showed. I gave them a max of 2 hours to load everything they could, and they were able to load an entire house in our storage pod for us. While I was really happy that they finished more than I thought they would in their 2-hour window, I was upset that they scheduled a 2-hour job after a day full of other, longer jobs, there was no compensation offered for the inconvenience of having our time slot postponed again and again, and I am still waiting for my receipt that I requested from the movers before they left. The movers themselves were polite and professional, they moved quickly and efficiently, and they were apologetic for the experience we had. A bit too little, too late in our case. Two stars because of the professionalism of the movers, but I would not recommend this company to others."

hNWMvT7FBc6yrLxTZg3Zxg,4nJlNS5f4S75CwdTWgxY7w,"Flowers don't match up to website OR the price. 

We came across A Floral Expression, went to the website, picked out an arrangement and called Sherri. Sherri was agreeable and let us know that the ""Birthday Confetti"" arrangement online could be done and delivered. We wanted the flowers to be a bit bigger so we asked to increase the price from $50 to $75 hoping for a fuller arrangement (see photos). We've had issues with flower deliveries in the past so we asked that she text us a photo of the completed arrangement and she happily agreed.

Things seemed to be in order. Then slowly things started to unravel.

1. NO text of the finished flowers! She let us know ""she forgot"".
2. We get a photo from the birthday girl and we were not impressed (the flowers DIDN'T match the website advertisement).
3. The $75 arrangement looked more like something you could pick up from the grocery store for $40 (see photo).

We understand small businesses and want to support them, so we contacted Sherri to let her know that the flowers seemed a bit on the cheap side. She defended the arrangement via text and when we let her know we weren't satisfied, her solution was to return to the home and pick up the flowers. Way to add insult to injury. 

I suggest you order from a different small flower shop in N. Las Vegas. We really wanted this surprise to be special and were underwhelmed by the flowers and disappointed by the price. The worst part is the ""offer"" to pick up the flowers after they had been delivered...who would want that?!"

Later that evening i called them and was told should be done the following day. It took them 5 days to get it back to me. Also my face to my stereo was stolen from my truck. I approached them before i left and the owner told me that it was my fault and just walked away. Totally disrespectful. Never go here. Thay are liars and treat your vehicle like crap. Beware!!!!!

They've been remodeling recently.  But they do have a LOT of stuff for many different types of RCs.  The quadcopter parts selection is particularly impressive.  Prices are typical retail or a little lower on some parts.  Sometimes they are lower than online price on some things.

Most of the employees are super-helpful, and knowledgeable.  I've been able to get things fixed/built simply because they were helpful and steered me right.  They are really into the hobby themselves and like to share it.  I've had some great advice given for a friend's kids' first RC truck, and it was a great choice.

The track is well run and nicely built.  There is a LOT of setup/repair space nearby.  Price is pretty cheap."

The last time I checked this was a free country and since I have insurance I can go to any healthcare facility I want and get good care. The ethical practices of the billing department at this office is also very questionable.This doctor also  likes to give you lots of very expensive vitamins and potions that you can buy much cheaper elsewhere and that you may not need.

She knew exactly where everything was, and gave me two size options to try.

In the changeroom, Taneesha came in and adjusted me, and explained that small girls with large busts gotta wear their bands up a bit higher. I felt a lot more confident in rocking an off shoulder crop top for a party tonight! Thank you Taneesha and Jodie!

I was just a bit put off by the service. Granted it was a busy Saturday morning, but we were left standing up front for a long time and I just eventually sat myself down. I don't know if this pissed off the servers because we were ignored for at least ten minutes before anyone acknowledged us. Maybe they sensed we were out-of-towners or something, but I felt really uncomfortable. I was getting ready to leave when a server finally came over to take our order. Then it was another long wait for food. The whole experience left me cranky and put a damper on my whole day. If you have a higher tolerance for this type of service and you think the food is worth it, by all means ignore my review. This place just didn't live up to my basic minimal standards for a pleasant dining experience and it's overpriced."

Had to wait quite awhile to be told they didn't have it. In short, this store is understaffed.

As far as job completion times, they are standard.  Quality of work is good.  If there are any issues with the repairs they give a no bull 90 day warranty on all labor.  Due to the nature of my older vehicles I have had to use this warranty before and he was able to personally come over and tow my truck back to his shop and resolve the repair at no extra expense.  You can trust them in their word and prices regarding parts and hourly labor prices.  If things will need any extra work or additional parts they will notify you and give you the option.  Many occasions I have needed a discontinued part and they have always been able to locate them, even if they had to go to the Pick-a-part for it.  There are rims and tires, exhaust and car audio systems available as well.  Here's a tip: just talk the job over with the owner and he will give you an actual basic rundown of what the job will cost and you will see that he just tries to do what is necessary for the repair.

On 5-30-17 I visited Gentle Dental for regular cleaning and checkup I was told by Dr. Truman (get that... his name has True in it! ha) Seiler that I have a small cavity on tooth #31 which is next to  the implant. He explained, in great detail, that it needed to be taken care of before the implant is done. Listening to this ""expert"" I agreed and he did the filling. I paid my copay of $69.20.
On 7-18-17 I returned to the same office, same dentist complaining that this tooth that they had filled was bothering me . What does Truman Seiler tell me? He explains to me, again in great detail, that the filling was an old filling and need to come out!!! Ummmm, you JUST DID THIS EXACT FILLING!! 2months ago, CLOWN! So, now said clown dentist tells me he didn't do the filling. I left and went to another dentist who needed to now do a root canal and bonus, I got to pay out of pocket for it!

On 2-12-2015 I was told by these clowns that I need to replace a crown on tooth #30. While replacing the crown and completing the root canal they broke a file  in the canal. So, what did they do? They completed the root canal and placed the crown WITH THE BROKEN FILE STILL IN THERE!!! Of course, I continued getting infections in this tooth.  I went to Grand Avenue Family Dental where I was told that said tooth has a broken file and was given a picture of the broken file.
When Gentle Dental was presented with solid facts they told me they would remove tooth 30 and give me a free implant at no cost to me. So, I'm sure you can guess what happned next... They are billing me for what they said was going to be gratis for the incompetence they have shown in patient care or common sense. I'm being billed over  $500 for extracting this tooth. 
SO, the moral of this story is if you want to be ripped off, treated poorly, misdiagnosed, made to suffer and pay them for all this by"

I have had several sessions with Dr.  Becker and I am impressed by his level of patience and compassion. He has been careful to explain everything to me before he does it and tailored his approach to my care to my specific comfort and needs. I have begun to get some relief from the hand pain and my neck and back feel amazing...better than they have in years
 I highly recommend Dr. Becker and Chiropractic Plus if you are in need of relief from pain in your neck or back, or other ailments."

This was at 10am.  They called at 7pm to say they didn't get the chance to deliver it, but how about later this week?  Then when I said no, and asked about a refund, the guy hung up. I had to call back and let it ring about 500 times before he finally picked up and when I told him I was going to charge back on my credit card, he agreed to refund me.

STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!"

Health issues make bending over to remove the little ""gifts""  a real issue for us. We love our fur-babies, treat them like children, but did not love sanitation duty! 
We chose the bi-monthly service which means that someone comes twice a month to remove the little poopy-doos left by my two little Shih Tzu, we find that having the service every two weeks is sufficient for our needs. 
On each visit, the droppings are picked up. The yard is sanitized, deodorized and our backyard no longer emanates  Eau d'Pee or Essence of Doggy-doo! 
With easy auto-billing and auto pay, it is a simple process. We believe that the cost is fair for the service provided and a pleasure to work with POODINI. 
We have a regularly scheduled appointment day and receive a text message the day before with estimated time of visit.  Another is sent when the job is complete.

CskOctATmX5iy2jSZ-5rsw,H9zfYvIa80WBjclz1QaMqQ,"I scheduled an appointment for a yearly physical, about three weeks prior to today.  The appointment was scheduled for 9 am.  I arrived two minutes late, checked in and sat down. (I already felt badly enough about this, I get severe anxiety about doctor's appointments, more so about being late).  

I then waited a full forty minutes, before I was called back to the front desk and informed that, because I had not arrived at 8:30 for my 9 am appointment, they would not be able to see me today. My anxiety was wreaking havoc, so sitting there waiting that forty five minutes was hell.  If I had been told immediately, I would consider going again, but they let me sit for nearly an hour.  If I had been informed at any point when I made the appointment that I needed to be there at 830 am, I would consider going again.  

Don't go here if you want a primary care group that has any respect for your time at all. (And yes, I realize two minutes late isn't ideal, I prefer to arrive ten minutes early for appointments, but with two small children I am not always in control of that, but that's no reason to then let someone sit for nearly an hour).  Horrible, horrible experience."
uWUGJVpsACeHqtiigWC26g,KlTLXLm_rnAUkYyvD1pnBA,"I've been going to Port Union Lawrence Chiropractic (from here on to be referred to as PULC out of laziness) for almost... 5 years or more. My chiropractor is Dr. Solanki and I can't really say I trust anyone else to crack my back and neck. Once someone has jerked your head to the side quickly to adjust your vertebrae, and you don't die, you feel a certain level of comfort with that person.

So I can (without hesitation) recommend taking your chiropractic problems to the PULC and having a visit with Dr. Solanki. Aside from his skill as a professional, he's a good guy.

Now a few extra details about the PULC.  As far as I know there are more than one chiropractor at this office, but I never see them because of the time my wife and I both go (yes, she's a fan of Dr. Solanki as well). They are open on Saturday mornings but with reduced office staff.

They also have on site massage therapists. The last time I was there I over heard the receptionist talking on the phone. ""... all of our massage therapists are female."" So for those of you out there who are calling around the city in an attempt to avoid a massage from a dude this could be your place!

So if your medical coverage covers massage make sure you book early. Appointments for the end of the year fill up fast as people try to exhaust their coverage limits during the holidays season

Other than that, they are a convenience store that charges you for that convenience when you are in desperate need for milk and don't want to drive the extra 5 minutes to save a dollar or so. Rightfully so.

They do sell chicken which i've only tried just one time in two years coming here. i remember thinking the hot wings weren't too shabby...for a gas station.  

Their pumps do allow you to set them so you don't have to hold it which is mandatory for my go-to fill up station."
1qmsZxZZWvRsy5Z31MKerQ,Ug0ujy9-jd0Oc2nk3KIotA,"First the Restaurants drink the Kuel-Aid, then...

Show Off or Show-out! ! !  What started as a Potentially GREAT Idea, though maybe NOT well executed. Who suggested the Restaurants could create dishes just for the week that would not be on the menu (in some cases never again)!  WAIT !  If something is wrong with the regular menu, Change the Menu !  !!  !!!  Instead each Restaurant could Feature Favorites, something tried and true NOT tired and through!  Or Feature Favorites and something that is Newly added to the Menu!

What I like about Charlotte Restaurant Week :

Exclusivity : NOT Every Restaurant is Eligible!  Restaurants may Submit a Menu (Plan) and be excepted or not!

Membership : Restaurants must PAY to be ""IN""

Promotion :  Plenty of Publicity and though most of it is silly, it is memorable, like it or not, it is Branded Well !!!

If I would have reviewed this Event Three Years ago this might be a 4 or 5 star review!  Every Year (if not every time twice a year) for the most part the List of Restaurants gets BIGGER and the Menus get less appealing!

What I do NOT like about Charlotte Restaurant Week : 

Everything Rises and falls on leadership, this time I will not be challenging anyone to a Wrestling match and the loser has to leave Town (I'm already Gone)!  Most of these CRW Menus are not a GREAT Deal!  This is NOT, N O T a loss leader, so do NOT Promote it as one!

When I ask Out-of-town Friends (you know what I mean) or Family (more likely) to pick out some Restaurants to eat for CRW and they read the Menu's online or compare prices to the Restaurants regular Menu, I always hear the same two things and I notice the same things myself, Many do not sound that Great, nor is it much a of a ""deal"" in many cases!

I'm blaming the Restaurants for BUYING this (not initially, because it used to be better) year after year and ""BUYING"" (they ARE Paying for it AND PAYING or IT!!!) the idea that they need to participate AT ALL ! ! !   Or that they should make a special menu (some of them), serving Sub-par food and hurting their reputation as some have instead of promoting how GREAT they can be!  

Charlotte Restaurant Week WAS a Great Idea, Gone WRONG!"

Yea, we always called in mong gok because that's what it's called in Chinese. I actually just went not too long ago, and they changed the sign to ""New Kennedy Square"", although I still see Peachtree Mall on one of the signs.

A couple stores have changed since this plaza has opened, but there have been shops that have been here for decades, like the store that sells popcorn and cotton candy. Or the store that sells sugar cane drinks. More food court booths have opened here, though the one that is directly in the middle of the food court always seems to close, probably because feng shui isnt as great in the spot, no idea tbh. 

The not so dollar, dollar store is here selling any item you can think of. There are fewer bootleg dvd shops as before. I remember bootleg dvds were like $20 for 3 or $10 for 3 when they were popular in the day.

YN58Coh1nvnsNS0FXIeAKg,Ch47WbmGs7JNaO1HyFSUkQ,"Erin and the Divine Celebrations team are fabulous!  I really don't know how I could have pulled off our Wedding Day without her.  Erin is so sweet and easy to talk with during the planning process.  She even supported me by attending the meeting I had with the hotel that was the site of our reception.

On our Wedding Day, I didn't have to worry about a thing.  She handled everything from the wedding ceremony to the reception--setting up the church, movement of guests before and after the service, the flower and cake delivery, the linens, helping with the band and dj, making both the happy hour and reception rooms look amazing, etc.  She even got some great pictures of everything for us before the guests arrived so we could see what it all looked like.  Oh and our place card table--totally Erin.  She arranged them beautifully on a table with little details that matched the theme of our wedding.  I hadn't even thought about these details and here she took care of all of it.

Not only was Erin such a delight, but so is the rest of her team.  Everyone was scooting around throughout the reception taking care of things.  It gave my husband and I--and family a chance to enjoy the evening without worry.  I really felt like they were invested in our special day.  Erin was not just our wedding planner, she became a friend.  I highly recommend Erin and Divine Celebrations for their wedding planning services."

Love the boathouse, love the spirit of sport the members share.  I row a single so don't have any experience with the eights; I'm sure they are patient with new people and help introduce novices to this great sport.

Coming from open-water rowing, the bends aren't that big a deal, but I would caution new people to start with the eight with coxswain, so someone can steer for you.  If you hit one of the bulkhead walls, your craft will be far less crafty.  Head down there and meet these guys.  Pamela's comparison to Hash House is apt.

TeqMow367t0t4a2ZmTuvIA,MycctOER5yZtixDL64Bz8g,"I had an odd experience here earlier in the year.

Seeking a blazer, not wanting to spend too much, and having done some research, I made my appointment, confirmed over the phone and dropped in at the appointed time.  The space is pretty nice.  Tomas was finishing up with a client or some business so I began with his assistant.  She took me through how the process works and some of my choices, even answering some of my many questions.

(At this point I should confess that I can be a salesperson's worst or best customer because I've likely done too much homework)

About halfway through Tomas emerges and we have a nice chat about this item, clothing in general, etc.  I try on a test jacket and he measures me up, his assistant taking down the measurements.  We then went through the options and I noticed that the base price kept climbing and climbing as I opted for what should be standard features like surgeons cuffs.  He only could offer me two fabrics but had to check to see if he could get the less expensive choice.  After getting everything input, he was off to help another customer who came in.  I was told I would be contacted about the fabric but was never called or e-mailed.  

After several weeks I went to my regular guy who, while more expensive, is worth it.    I thought it was odd that I wasn't contacted again.  

A few other points:

I asked if this was made-to-measure or bespoke and Tomas danced around the question saying that his work was ""custom"".  I feel that a garment is either one or the other, unless it is OTR.  Perhaps he meant that it is ""bespoke-ish"" in that a pattern is not cut out for you but everything else (fabric choice, labour, construction, etc.) is that of a bespoke suit.  At any rate, it was not clear.

The fact that I only had two possible choices for a blue blazer was pretty limited.  Other tailors can offer you a choices of dozens in store or 1000s out of the book if you want to pay more and wait a little longer.

My overall impression is similar to what has been expressed by another reviewer in that Tomas is more of business man than an old school tailor.

The fact that he and the assistant were simply inputting things into an online form led me to think that all they were doing was adding a layer over what you can do online at home.  There are lots of online custom, made in China sites now for men's clothing.  Maybe it is possible to work with these companies where you can open up a storefront, charge a premium but give the actual labour to somebody else?

Tomas did say the clothes are made in Canada but not by who or where.

The number of measurements was limited although he did take into account some irregularities (one shoulder hangs lower).

I was offered water or tea/coffee but not the good stuff as shown on the website.  Maybe the scotch is just for show or is only offered after you've spent a few grand?

Again, the place did feel hip and cool but not quite like tailor shops I'm used to.

The process felt a bit rushed--maybe I came at the wrong time or had used up my allotted hour quicker than I realized.

Bottom line: While I do believe that many guys have been able to get satisfaction here, I'd advise you to look elsewhere in the city for either MTM or bespoke."

The lube oil filter can run anywhere from 14.95 to 19.95 depending on the coupon you get. Either way I can't do it this cheaply by myself.

There are very few people I would trust with a wrench around my vehicle, but this Conrads is one of them. I've never had to take my car back to have them rework a repair or do it over again. Even if I did I have a feeling that they would take care of it very quickly."

OWu_ftGoAIFjFENBsuFGpg,HpcqeJwnBCTZhMgPpUsslQ,"A solid 4.5!!

It's a great experience at the Q esthetics laser clinic's  modern Mississauga location. Recently I received Silk peel dermal facial   at the this clinic and boy I was absolutely blown away by the treatment and how it made my skin feel so incredible.The facility is nice and clean with professional skincare staff willing to help you throughout your stay here.There is ample amount of parking right in front of the clinic.

Initially, I was a little skeptical since I normally don't incorporate Laser light therapy in my routine facials but I was astounded to see the kind of care they gave me and how my skin felt extremely rejuvenated, clearer and fresh immediately after the treatment.

My skin care nurse(Czrina) was informative and attentive but not pushy at the same time she examined my skin and complimented me on having good skin and suggested we should go ahead with anti-aging and skin bleaching route since I have a few acne spots on my chin. She tailored the facial to my skin needs which I thought is very important for a happy customer.

Coming down to the actual facial, it's an hour long treatment The first half hour includes numerous treatments which included a diamond tip exfoliation. Before starting the treatment I had informed my nurse that I have very sensitive skin and she chose for me the lightest tip which caused no pain during the treatment or redness after the treatment.

The next step was the vacuum eradication that sucked all the dead skin. All the dead skin is gathered into a bottle which you can see at the end of the treatment-mine was fairly clean but it could be an eye-opener to a lot of clients. This phase of the treatment also includes the application of vitamin C serum.

Last 30 minutes of the treatment is allocated for the cold laser therapy. The lights used in the machine are strong and at times flashing with different colors. It wasn't easy to pass those 30 minutes but the excitement to see my skin after the treatment helped me go through that. A complimentary post treatment sample box was also given at the end of the treatment.

My face felt so amazing after the treatment I had a beautiful glow as you can see in the photo I have posted.My acne scars weren't noticeable anymore.

I really have no suggestions regarding the treatment since it was so immaculate and professionally done but my only suggestion would be  to make the coffee machine more visible for the waiting  customers to use.

I thoroughly enjoyed my afternoon here and will definitely be going back  to get some more skin fixes."

I should mention that both my wife and I are extremely 'picky' home shoppers and rather hyper A-type retired senior government folks, but Lily managed to keep us relaxed and help us work through some differences in home preferences and find us a place we were both pleased with.

1jmJ6wwlIsMozIx5_ld-3Q,ZzND0-NZUvwSSHJJUz1OzA,"No words can do justice to the amazing gift we received from Mr. Dave Heck...but I'll try. In November 2013, we adopted an 85 pound 2 year old Old English Bulldog named Samson. The original owner gave him up because he was too hyper and didn't have time to work with him. 
We could tell from the first day that he was probably never walked on a leash and he had no manners. Samson's bad habits included jumping on people, pulling on his leash, lunging and showing aggression towards big dogs, jumping on furniture and counters, not sitting still in the car and barking...just to name a few! I also must add we have 2 other dogs, chihuahua mixes. One loves Samson dearly and the other would like to rip his throat out any chance he gets. At first Samson ignored the chihuahua's outburst but I guess after being attacked so many times he has had enough! Because of their hate for each other we have suffered bite marks, scratches, and holes in our screen doors. 
Something needed to be done! After reading several reviews and making several calls it was the call to Dave Heck that changed our world. 
From the first day we met Dave it felt like he was part of the family.
Samson thought so too. He did his normal ""welcome"" for our guest....he jumped on Dave, slobbered on him, tried to eat his laptop bag, leaped from one side of the couch to the other and was just downright rude. In the middle of all that, Dave went over how the training works and what options were the best for our Samson. He told us to think about our options and to let him know whenever we were ready. Dave was very upfront and never made us feel forced to make a decision. He then invited us out to meet his dog Mr. Luke. After seeing what Luke could do, we instantly decided Dave was the real deal.  
By the first day of our second week of training Samson was already a different dog. He no longer dragged us down the steps...which was a big accomplishment!!!! For the remaining two weeks we met with Dave once a week and worked with Samson on basic commands. This requires lots of homework and patience. If you don't do your homework you won't see results. 
When Dave came back for our three week review he was amazed that Samson just sat quietly and did not jump on him or the furniture. Dave gave him the ok to join group classes. Group classes are a lot of fun and great training for you and your dog. 
We also left Samson with Dave for the Board and Review. This is where you leave your dog with Dave while you're away and he continues to strengthen your dog's abilities. Now keep in mind, Samson is not good with all other dogs! Not even 24 hours with Dave, Samson was socializing with Dave's dogs and never had an outburst. We are still working on his socializing, as he is still picky about certain dogs. 
As of today Samson is a much happier dog and getting smarter with every homework session.
And to this day, Dave still gives us as much attention, support and guidance as he did the day we signed up."

Top Must-Get: mutton
Top Regret: chicken patty

This place apparently opened six months ago (October 2016) but I only recently noticed it after a Domino's pizza run! It's nestled in an easy-to-miss plaza and doesn't face the main road, but it's two units down from Domino's.

It serves South Asian and Sri Lankan goods, and was empty when we stumbled across it at 9 pm on a Sunday. Eventually another person ordered something there too, but I don't think the location is very noticeable.

First time there, I only grabbed a mutton roll and chicken patties. It took under 10 minutes for the order to come out. The staff person seemed slightly taken aback by our arrival but was friendly.

Mutton roll was $1. Chicken patty is normally more, but since I originally wanted chicken roll, they just charged me $1 (and got three mini samosa looking patties...)

The mutton roll was VERY oily but still tasted delicious; packed with meaty, gamey goodness with a bit of heat.

Chicken patty was also super oily and packed MORE heat than the mutton roll but was not as flavourful. The chicken was bland and dull tasting.

Will be back to try the biryani!"

NO STAR REVIEW! ....not even worth 0.01 of a star. real bad quality work. long review but worth reading to avoid my mistake.

this is my 2nd review here at yelp (i usually just lurk and read reviews, but i really have to write this review to prevent you or others from going to this place).

   vegas heat was around the corner so i decided to get my car tinted. my coworker recommended a tinting place he normally goes to but his bad direction didnt help. i ended up looking at craigslist. SIN CITY TINT AND ALARMS had an ad with $30 off on their $129 tint job. tempting. i rushed over before they closed. one hour before closing, they accepted my car. i was told its going to take 2-2 1/2 hours. the place smelled like wet dog (of coarse cause they have 3 bulldogs) so i decided to walk around outside and check out this korean store. one hour and 15mins later i decided to check out autozone (same building as sincity tint. right next to each other). voila! my car is parked outside. finished. my big mistake was paying right away without checking. oopps. windows were dirty (seems they used dirty rags). 

   while driving back home the car reeked of wet dog. worse part is, i couldnt even open the windows for ventalation (new tint rule). when i got home i decided to wipe off the windows clean. OOOOH S***!! What the F***! (that was my reaction). i called them the next day. i informed them of how badly they did the tint. it looked like they ddint clean the windows real well before putting in the tint. there were specks everywhere and scratches. they told me to bring it back in a week cause it could just be the water bubbles that should dry in a few days. i told them it aint bubbles, but they told me even if i bring it in now they wont accept it. not until i give it a week. 

   a week later i brought it back in. they looked at it, comfirmed the specks and scratches. but instead of trying to fix their bad tint job, they tried to squeeze more money out of me. they told me those specks came from a supposedly old tint that was previously in the car and was removed. and that they have to charge me extra 80 dollars to fix it. wow....what! we argued and argued. to the point the i wanted them to rip it off and give me money back. they wont return my money or redo the work unless i pay more. (real sad that authorities cant do anything about these kinds of situation). finally we came to an agreement to of $40 dollars. i was pissed and i wanted it fixed. they couldnt do it that same day cause they tell me its gonna take half a day to redo everything. 

   a week later i brought it back. 6hrs later (15mins before they close) they call back to tell me its done. GUESS WHAT! YUP, specks. but not much. when i got home. i noticed my driver side window was lighter than the rest (initially i had them do 15% on the back and 30% on front). finally i realized they only changed 3 windows (the front passenger side window, the two back passenger side windows). and left the rear window and my driver side window untouched. the new tint they used were all 15%, leaving the driver side window untouched and at 30%. i managed to bring my car back to them after a week later of frustration (busy sked). one of the only two guys that work there decided to wiggle the mistake AGAIN away from their hands even after i just finished telling him that the they only changed 3 windows and not all. lucky me the other guy (the owner i guess) confirmed that they did ANOTHER MISTAKE. they told me to make another appointment.

   i brought it back today (6/15/12, which is 4 days after i showed them the lighter shaded driver side window. i waited at autozone (again the dog smell). 45 minutes later. my car was done. i inspected it. and of coarse, you guessed it, a whole bunch of specks and un-squeezed out water bubbles. went back inside and told them to redo it again. not only specks and water bubbles. there were DOG HAIR all over the carpet! nasty! surprise! the dude tried to wiggle out of it again and blamed the hidden dust that are hiding inside the door panel. guess what!? he told me to remove the door panel so he can do the job better. wooooow seriously? luckily, i carry a tool set in the car. i removed the door panel and had them redo the tint. 15mins later its done. and guess what. still some specks (few but still there). i drove out of there wishing i should have spent the extra money at a different place instead of trying to save 80-100 dollars. 

   another mistake i did was not informing the UNLUCKY new customers that walked in while i was there. sorry guys (i thought if i had said something for them to lose business they might not redo the tint in my car and/or do something bad to my car). 

this is real bad business. and i urge people to stay away. unless you crave frustrations."

JCY is a trend follower, they carry all the ""cool hip"" brands such as Paul Frank, Seventy, Juicy Conture (am I outta it, or is juicy still in?!?), Emily the Strange (LOVE her), Miss Sixty, and Versace. 

I bought a Killah Babe vest a few years ago, probably the best quality jacket I've ever gotten believe it or not. The material is still fluffy and puffy, and the jacket has given me no problems. It retailed for over $200, and I got it for I believe just over $100. Not too shabby if you can find some sale items. 

Still expect t-shirts to be around $40, jogging pants and sweats over $100 and jeans to be $300+.  They have extremely funky items, check the website for evidence. But they are also overpriced, also check the website and make note that there are no prices available.

6YjpS-sik6EBvMW6yv-dHg,beGr8BtdQ1h8cUHce5ZHPw,"Where do I even start..

Pros: Safe neighborhood, lots of grocery stores in the area, no crazy bugs.

Cons: endless... First problem, customer service from both the office and maintenance is horrible! I had my AC go out in July and called the emergency number because it was over 100degrees outside to be told ""I can't do anything to fix it at night so I'll come back in the morning"" umm what's the point of emergency maintenance then? It's called a flash light! Get one. Then when I moved out I needed to get rental verification from the office and they lolly gagged on doing it even after we called and spoke with the manager and asked her to send it over. Also, when I told the manager about my AC going out multiple times in July she said ""that never happens so I'll look into it"" but if you click on the not recommended review you'll see it had happened to other people as well. Oh and they NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE.

Second problem, THIN WALLS!!! I could literally hear everything all my neighbors did. My upstairs neighbor stayed up all night and my downstairs neighbor turned their bass up extra high and my next door neighbors would ""do it"" loudly! So horrible! I would have been so mad if I had kids and they were hearing all that!

Third problem, horrible parking! Somehow people must not work there so they always have the same parking spots. Also, don't bother asking to buy a covered parking spot because they have no extra since the people who have been living there for ages have them all!

Last but not least. Don't think your going to get any sleep during the week if your sick! They do yard work all day everyday!

I wish someone could have told me these things about this place before I relocated from Ohio and had to pick without looking! Hope this helps if your considering living here!"

Such a beautiful lake!

I've never been on a speed boat before so when my friend asked me if I'd be interested in joining her & her local friends on a boat outing, I said why not. I only live once so I might as well enjoy it while I'm young and healthy.

There were a lot of boats that showed up even though it was a Tuesday afternoon.  I didn't think that many people would have been available on a weekday, but I guess when you're out in Vegas any day can be a weekend.

Even though the temperature showed that it was 90 degrees, but being on the boat with the nice breeze made it seem so much more bearable.  

The lake was so nice and peaceful.

I'd definitely come back again!"

You are greeted at the door with a hello and a sales person that wants to follow you around.  This is a huge turn off to me. I want to be left alone to look and not have anyone following me trying to make a sale.  If I want to buy I will buy.. not from what a sale person says but by my own opinion of the furniture.  

The original prices are extremely high so the sale prices are about what I would expect the normal price to be not on sale.   So I did not really find and good deals.  There was however some nice dinner table chairs that I liked a lot for $35 a piece and for the quality and style this was a very nice price for them. other then the chairs I was not impressed with the deals.  

I did not look through the whole store as I was very frustrated with the sales people watching me like vultures and I left irritated.   Had they left me alone and just given me their card and name to get the sales credit if I did buy something I would have most likely stayed to look further and would have got the chairs.

From the minute we walked in and were greeted by Shirin, the owner, it felt as though we were a part of someone's home and were welcomed and we cozied in immediately thanks to her big smile and warm enthusiasm. 
The prime rib that was prepared by the chef, Bob, who is the owner and husband of wonderful hostess Shirin was the best beef I have ever tasted in my life! It simply melted in your mouth, it was cooked to absolute perfection and the most tender meat you can imagine.
Served alongside was a delicious fresh creamed horseradish sauce, decadent new potatoes mashed with fresh garlic and steamed garden vegetables. 
Of course there were delicacies of appetizers and a beautiful ceasar salad, etc.
Wonderful chocolate cake with a maple and orange peel glaze filling and goodies that I can go on about....
The service and the food are simply outstanding!! And so although this restaurant is a little out of the way and you are best to have reservations because there is limited seating but it is so absolutely worth the drive!  

You will think you are in heaven ... and the views are spectacular also!!
I did not even get to mention how spectacular the views and location is....

You must go here!!"

The gas is always cheaper than the other stores in the area, the staff is usually pretty friendly, the store is always clean, and they are fairly competitive with prices inside the store as well.

The have a great selection of drinks and food including a Fountian Drinks and their ""grill"". As a bonus they have a fixin's bar where you can add toppings to your sandwiches, nachos, etc.

They also have an attached car wash that you can get a discount at if you buy gas and a car wash at the same time.

My only major gripe is that they charge a fee to use your debit card, however if you run a debit card as credit, they don't charge anything"

Guess what? Nothing has changed. It was 2:30pm on a weekday (hardly peak rush hour for banks on a 110 degree day). The line waiting for tellers went all the way to the door of the bank. That alone would prevent me from wanting to return to this branch."

PPGX3aNoxgKzmY3g5Jr8lA,A7X_6kzt_vchHi375AMGCw,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. I went to Dr. Kwark for the first 5 months of my first pregnancy and it was probably the worst experience of my life. As I said it is my FIRST pregnancy so... maybe for people on baby 3 or 4 she might be a good choice but for me it was awful. She never explained ANYTHING that was happening or that she was doing to me. I never even got information on what I could eat! I had a really really rough start and she never tried to work out what was wrong or help me in any way. She would make vague statements about things being abnormal or odd and I should see this or that specialist and set me to panicking, take mystery blood tests that I never knew what were for or what the results were, and then when I would ask on the next visit she would not even remember correctly... I think she got me mixed up with some of her other clients a few times. She never spent more than a few minutes with me and pretty much avoided any sort of eye contact the whole time. When I filed for intermittent FMLA it took almost 3 weeks to get the paperwork back, the staff in front is extremely rude, and when I started contracting and spotting at 20 weeks I called the overnight emergency service- the Dr. on call took 3 hours to call me back and then could not speak very good english, asked if the baby was still moving (at 20 weeks?... OK) and then said he would have Dr. Kwark contact me the next day. I called 3 times the next day- the first time I was told no message was passed on and to call back, when I called back she was various degrees of busy and would get back to me. I never received a call back and ended up in the hospital because I had NO idea what was going on and was panicking. I ended up seeing 4 different specialists in the time that I was seeing Dr. Kwark before I saw a General Practitioner that explained what was going on, the terms she had been using, said it sounded like she wanted zero responsibility and recommended I get a different OB. Wouldn't you know I'm still sick (thank goodness only a few weeks left) but now I know what is happening with my body and I only have to see 1 Dr. What a concept. This place is a money mill... that is all. Get as many people in and out in a short amount of time as possible. The only good things about ANY person on this staff was the Nurse Assistant who was actually somewhat friendly, pleasant, and human. Final word- STAY AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE."

zhKTy6XLKkConDapIN11KA,P28OrLTcpxU0eOlwizYKeA,"Lori Walters honestly and truly is one of the worst ""professionals"" I've ever dealt with.
She is rude, inefficient, never returns emails or phone messages, is quick to lose her temper when you are trying to get information out of her, and quite frankly, I'm dismayed that she is even allowed to be in a professional capacity where she has so much control over people's money.  Since when did doing business with people mean putting up with ALL the things they're NOT supposed to do as a professional? Like why be in business if you're going to do everything wrong, all the time. If you're going to be a senile, crazy, old bat, do it somewhere else.

As a tenant you can do everything to the letter, submit everything on time, and she will still say that you did something wrong, will not get back to you in a timely manner, and heaven forbid you have anything wrong with your house: it will NEVER get fixed.

Just horrible, and appalling and doing business with Lori instills a certain degree of hopelessness in you, as you will never actually be dealing with a sane, level-headed, professional person. 

If you have the misfortune of finding her as your property manager, I sincerely wish you the best of luck, and I feel bad for you."

eE59bLL5FJwfcXvrqaxTJw,Vo4SKqrCs7Alk-YqW6R1Pw,"If I could give 0 stars I would.  We went to their showroom and did get reasonable assistance with our flooring needs for our small project (10 x 12 office).  We were torn between two tiles and we were allowed to bring samples home.  We called the store in less than an hour of arriving home.  He (we do not remember his name...think about it) took our address and number and said the would be in contact to come out and measure.  Before all of this he advised us it would be end of June (at best) they could install...which was roughly 2+months).  After almost 3 weeks of not hearing back from No Name we contacted a different company.  That contact resulted in our flooring being completed in less than a week (start to finish...selection, install, etc.).  We decided that when we returned the samples we would politely let them know they had the sale, if they would have simply followed up.  However, the gentleman in the store just took the samples and said ""Thanks"" when we stopped in.  Not a single question/comment about if we picked one, if they would work, nothing except ""thanks"" and walking away.  ARE YOU SERIOUS?!  There was your chance to close a sale (as far as you could have known) and you do not even ask a single question?!  Do not waste your time with this company.  They apparently do not want to waste their time with customers."

A few days later I had a message to call. I returned the call and left a message. Still no call. So my review is strictly because it seems very difficult to get any kind of estimate. I like to getvestimates and get stuff done as I have time lines as well. Apparently this business doesn't take that into consideration.

If you order something from drive thru the staff at the pickup window almost shoves all things towards you. I've had them give me bagel napkins and my change all at once.

I had to keep my equipment that didn't work and sell it on Craigslist, and I could only get half of what I paid for it!!! That manager wouldn't even exchange it! we even asked for a store credit! He said no! 

I went home and filed a complaint with the BBB and I told them exactly what happened. 

Today, at about 3 in the afternoon, the manager, Carlos, called my HOME TELEPHONE and yelled and cursed at me! He said that I made the situation up, that I was a liar!! He cursed at me, and told me to ""never come in my fucking store again!""

Since I reported him, I found two new shops that are much better than AZ sea bottom and also cheaper! they answer my questions, give good deals and don't call my home and use profanity.

I don't understand how any business person can get away with that? They had my number in their computer, along with my address and full name, and they used it to call me and harass me.

Not only did they misdiagnose the issue after inspecting it for 4 hours, but the claimed my Compressor was blown and would require an extensive replacement- among other things. They quoted me $2,000 to restore the cooling functionality in my Acura...absolutely not! I then sought a 2nd opinion from an independent Honda dealer. They were quick, friendly, knowledgeable and guess what!? They replaced a coil and boom, my cooling has been restored for a WHOPPING $380...that's insane! Moral of the story is to not trust the initial assessment and always obtain a 2nd opinion from a dealer that specializes in your vehicle. Also, just skip on pep boys in the future on any services outside of basic oil changes and tire replacements. They literally tried to charge me 2k to replace several parts that were in great, working condition. It's bizarre and a terrible business move on their part. I'll never visit a Pep Boys again.

mydwaZMBCfXnaGjczwAVgg,aubtkSqnaWQF5g3-IfVhuw,"This Sleep Inn is a little off the beaten path -- it's behind an office complex and up a hill; if it weren't for GPS, I would not have found it. 

The room was really nice -- spacious, well-lit, and there was even a little sitting area with a couch and coffee table. There was a small refrigerator in the room as well. Unlike in many lower end hotels, this one had plenty of electrical outlets to recharge all your devices.

The bed was comfortable but the pillows were odd -- square, rather than rectangular, and too squishy for my taste. Fortunately, there were a lot of them, so I piled them up.

There was also a closet with hangers, an iron & ironing board and extra blankets & pillows.

The breakfast area was well-stocked. There was yogurt and hard boiled eggs in the refrigerator, along with the usual cereal, breads and make your own waffles. They also had some pre-made French toast and pancakes and a separate grill on which to warm them. The woman tending to the breakfast area was friendly and helpful.

My only real comment -- not actually a complaint -- is that I got there late and was hungry. I asked the young man at the desk if there was a place that was still open & that perhaps had sandwiches, and all he could think of was Buffalo Wild Wings. But right across from that is a Burger King, which, while not really sandwiches, would have been something worth mentioning. (There may have been more choices, but after a long drive, I didn't feel like exploring it any further.)

I'd never stayed at a Sleep Inn before (although, I have stayed at other Choice Hotels), and I was very pleasantly surprised."
pnfN4L279fWamBW4-XKwXA,ZWTR80zMUGlfcYMjTSQm0A,"If you are looking at this review to decide whether Koko fit club is a good idea, I'll save you some time. Do it!

The facility is spotlessly clean, rarely busy, intimidation free, technically advanced and they have some of the best staff of any business I have ever experienced. They help you with new moves and general operation of the machines and while they don't walk you through your entire workout, they are always keeping a watchful eye in case they can tweak a weight or form for a particular exercise. I mostly had experience with Tara and Michelle at this location. Both of them were great and really helped me get the most out of the workouts, but Michelle was my favorite.

If you are like me and most people, then weight/reps/workout times are very confusing. You can read books or the internet forever and will get multiple different opinions on what is best for you. This might cause you to either give up all together, try something out on your own with mediocre results or decide to hire a personal trainer. Guess what, personal trainers are expensive. Koko elegantly solves this problem by having a virtual trainer with you on every workout. The machine keeps track of all of you fitness test data, weight requirements, reps, speed, and range of motion both during the workout and stored on a usb key. You are free to choose from a variety of programs that match your goals. It completely takes all confusion out of working out. Just do what the monitor tells you. No yelling, no tight tank top, no bulging neck, no sweat smell.

Ok, well does it work? I visited Koko more than average (they recommend 3 days/week and I did 4+) but I was able to achieve a 33% overall strength gain my first month.

Welcome to the gun show."
RBEFjztls6xArCPUwX3EWA,a1OT3fnCv4hFQnb1lph-LQ,"As a professional remodeler i have found ForzaStone real stone panels to be one of the most innovative shower enclosure products to come along in years. I have always had clients that loved the look of stone tile showers. My opinion is that many of these clients would have jumper at the chance to have a stone shower or tub surround without the grout lines and the maintenance that the grout requires. 

Prior to ForzaStone there were no other options other than building showers out of the same stone slabs that we use for counter tops. Using thick slabs looked great, but the fabrication and labor to install it was prohibitive to most homeowners.

Now that ForzaStone is available to the Phoenix market, my remodeling company has found it to be very popular with our bathroom remodeling clients. 

The stone panels are reasonably priced and more time efficient for our installers that traditional stone tile instillation. The panels come in numerous colors, and stone varieties. The stone is cut thin, and bonded to an aluminum backing for strength and to create a waterproof barrier. Our craftsmen can cut the stone at the job-site with normal tile tools. The end result is a beautiful solid stone shower, or tub enclosure without grout for not much more than stone tile work. 

If you are considering having your remodeler use ForzaStone in your bathroom remodel, I would highly recommend the product's quality and beautiful end results."

They've really stepped up their game on their quality of home goods, and their grocery department is absolutely stacked to the rafters with fresh food and great prices.  It's nice to go to a big grocery store that is not an absolute mess - their aisles are full of product and very organized.  Great produce selection and everything is very fresh.

A few things on my Walmart wish list: More organic and gluten-free products; a self check-out line; and better meat selections (I couldn't find any ground chicken or turkey)."

ja2VhZGkLxEi2wtCFT1KhA,E-62DHu7J1OlG9Ro_4O23Q,"I've been in a few times now because I go to Gourmet Vapor which is right next door to them. While I will say that they are all very nice people, they do not offer a lot of art... 

I really like to get a variety of art done on my nails. Even if it's just a simple solid color and a different color on the ring finger. But anytime I ask, they try and talk me into just a white tip set. Kind of annoying.. I know what I want, and I don't want to be told that 'French tips' are more pretty and feminine.. 

All of that aside, their nail guy David is really nice. He is super funny and he really does do a decent job. I never have any of them fall off, which seems to happen EVERYWHERE I go. I rough house all the time with my nails and they always pop off, but these haven't not even ONCE. So that alone gets them a 4 star rating in my book. 

Prices are decent, but if you want any nail art, go somewhere else."

The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Mike was my official instructor and made me feel safe and comfortable behind the trigger. He was a blast too by making my target harder to hit and giving me all the best pointers! Never felt insecure or unsafe. Da Brown Guy (seriously, that's what's on his ID card and sweater!) was behind the counter and quick to give us all the required info for us to go again. 

Can't wait to go back again!"

When I was there, Alex was great, and gave me some awesome tips.  I went with three other guys, and even when he has a group, he gives specific attention to each person as he's giving the lessons.  I'd never golfed before, but he didn't put me down for that or get annoyed, just started with the basics, and helped me nail down some simple techniques! 

Another great thing about Alex, is he showed us all an app that allows you to watch your swing afterward, shows you posture and positioning issues, and helps you to make adjustments as you go!

Great, personable guy, and I'll send all of my friends his way!"

There's also a sandwich station with a great selection of fresh bread and sandwich toppings.

I'm comparing what was offered at this years Charlotte RW to 10 years of Miami Spice and it doesn't hold a candle. I'm also comparing RW dinner at Coppers to my previous experiences there, I spent the same as usual but service was rushed ( in a nearly empty restaurant) and some of the dishes were way sub-par - Vanilla sponge cake for desert ?? 



Unless things change, I'll be avoiding Charlotte's restaurant week in the future."

There were plenty of heartfelt tears during the bridal procession, and he provided such a great balance by offering some appropriate humor to the ceremony. He is just a funny guy! He's got such a way of making you feel cool, calm, collected before the ceremony. I loved getting the pep talk before game time! He wrote a beautiful ceremony for us: heartfelt, genuine, God-honoring, and memorable. That is exactly how I would describe him as an officiant... Memorable. Our guests complimented us on our choice of officiant... Guests were engaged during the 30 minute ceremony. We had the perfect balance of a traditional yet hip ceremony. He also took the time to meet with us prior to the wedding to get some background on us and to find out what we wanted to have for the overall feel of the wedding ceremony. Thank you Jimmy Mac from the bottom of our hearts for being a part of such a special day for us.

There was a horrid experience I had at this branch last year, but after speaking with the Manager of the Branch that day, then speaking to Corporate about the incident, I must admit.... since then things have seemed to turn around here.  

Last week when I made a large deposit into my business account one of the tellers finished the entire deposit of several checks in less than 5 minutes, which was record breaking time, and that was truly impressive!  Big time progress has occurred here, and I must commend the effort regarding efficiency! Good work Caitlin!"
b3PngyKRH6wTkMceU7h0FA,tWBLn4k1M7PLBtAtwAg73g,"Locals to the area may know of this building as a former beer bar, that originally intended to become a brewery but couldn't get through the legal loopholes to make or sell their own beer during their couple years of operation.
After a bit of shift in ownership, battling through the red tape, renaming and re-modelling the space, Lot 30 Brewers are officially open and brewing beer at 303 Lansdowne Avenue!

I'm very impressed so far, and there is lots of upside to stay excited about.

They currently have 9 house made beers available to drink on site or take away in tall cans to go.  They've covered a variety of styles, from easy drinking Pilsners and ESBs, tasty NE style IPAs, fruity sours, and even a Belgian Dubbel, Porter, and Saison to round things out. 
Flights ring in at $11 and all of the beers are pretty true to style and well made, although the Breakfast OJ IPA (made with lactose and blood orange) and their Surpass Raspberry Sour are my personal standouts. Jefferson Star Fruit Sour gets wildcard shout out for its unique flavour and smoothness.
Beers are expected to rotate with new styles and recipes coming, and I'm excited to see what else is to come.

Beyond the beer, the place has a nice warmth to the interior with lots of brick and wood beam walls, cozy booths, and some super slick looking communal tables for bigger groups. Even better, is that their patio should be functional within the next few weeks (and is one of the few west facing patios in the area for the benefit of that late evening sun).

Being a brew pub, I'll also point out there is food. I can personally vouch for the chicken wings and the beer braised pork sandwich (similar to a pulled pork, but with a less sweet sauce), both of which are well prepared and tasty meals.

Kudos to the Lot 30 team for transforming this place into the neighbourhood brew pub we've been waiting for!"
U9NeWizXL6V49KElTXW6mA,nHf_QGNpw0oP7uCeq7jzvg,"Pretty simple gym. Has all the basics: treadmills, ellipticals, weight machines, free weights etc. it is a pretty small space with a lot crammed into it so sometimes it's hard to find some free space. With that said the gym is hardly ever busy, especially early morning which is a plus. The only huge con is when there is a group class there is no free floor space to do crunches, stretches etc. Would recommend removing a few of the duplicate weight machines in favor of some mats. Overall a great gym for the price."

In just 30 minutes I burn most days between 500-600 calories, far more than I have ever done at any other gym I belonged too! There is never a wait to work out as there are no class times. I arrive, check in, put on my hand wraps and I am immediately put onto one of the stations. The owner, Matt, and his trainers are always available to push you to reach your goals and to assist you with anything you are not sure of. Currently I am enrolled in their Beach Body Challenge and I am loving it. This week I already lost 4 pounds! I highly recommend this gym."

I like to call ahead  and order so by time I get there in about 10 -15minutes it is ready to go. The pizza is not to thick or burnt on the bottom and taste similar too NY style ( not exact but close). The price for the large pizza is fair.

The staff is always friendly and they offer great customer service. They always put in extra cheese, pepper packets,and napkins (plates when I ask). I recently have  had a hard time calling ahead to place my order.  Answer your phone please Sbarro ! I've had no complaints or issues so far with the pizza. We will be back !"

The staff is really one of the best around - they always greet you at the door, answer any questions you might have, and offer to help take heavy items out to your car. If you ask where something is in the store, quite often someone will walk you right to it, rather than just point you to a general aisle. 

The selection is smaller than a big box, of course, but most of the time I'm able to find what I need there. They have a great selection of rentals at very reasonable rates.We've borrowed tall ladders, edgers, rototillers, etc. and have been very happy with them. On the rare occasion that something is wrong with the item we've rented, they've always made it right without a hassle. They also rent out carpet cleaners. I've forgotten the brand name that they rent out (it isn't Rug Doctor), but it works wonderfully. In the summer, they have a greenhouse outside, and the plants I've purchased from them have been healthy and always do well. 

If you are a frequent Ace customer, be sure to sign up for their rewards program. Once a year or so you'll get a $5 gift card to spend in the store, or even more depending on how much you've spent over the course of the year."

It is not a fancy place but it is very clean. Most of employees speak English and French. You can pay by cash or debit card only. No credit cards. Closed on Sundays."

The staff was amazingly friendly.  I truly got the feeling they cared for my well being.  I went on a Saturday afternoon and did not have to wait more than 5 minutes to get seen.

After they take your money you are screwed. They will cancel the flight if it's too windy, they'll cancel it if it's too calm, they cancel the flight if it's it's too warm... The business model here is to take non-refundable money from as many people as possible and fly as little as possible. Even when the conditions are PERFECT, if the pilot doesn't feel like getting up in the morning, you will be notified that the flight has been cancelled by calling an answering machine at 5:30am."

Dr. Fazel and his staff are headache savers and affordable. (and in network with my ins.)  For example, I had a dead root canal he detected, (another one didn't) I didn't have to go to to an endodontist which is added hassle and cost because he's comfortable with root canals, (at least basic ones) he does minimal tooth reduction and when I had a cleaning done, the cleaning lady took glue off my teeth from braces over 15 years ago, all the other cleaning people didn't bother to do over the years.  Accurate, thorough, definite diamond in the rough."

I ordered this new avocado, bacon and egg white sandwich that was a very unfortunate $5.50 that I wish I had never spent. Tiny sandwich with the smallest little morsel of bacon and barely any of the so called avocado. As you can see from my photo there were plenty of tomato but not much else. Even the egg was very sad. That was supposedly two eggs that they charged extra for also! My friend ordered a coffee and was also very disappointed that the coffee pots were almost empty and couldn't even fill up the entire cup. Would have complained but we were in a hurry."

The menu offers something for everyone, and the patio is large and nicely decorated.

Yes, it is fairly far, and yes, it is off the beaten path, but it is definitely worth a visit - I know it is on my to do list, for the near future.

My mother bought my husband and I a gift card for Fuzzy Peach in early April 2015 and each time we have visited Fuzzy Peach we have been told that we could not use the gift card. 
The first time the boy behind the counter told us that we would have to pay out of pocket but that he ""fixed"" the gift card so it should work during our next visit. We visited again about two weeks ago and again the gift card didn't work. The girl behind the counter told us that the boy lied to us because only manager has approval to override and if we wanted to discuss with him we could come back between the hours of 12 p.m. - 4 p.m. to speak with him. Mind you that my husband and I both work full-time jobs and don't have the option to take off from our jobs to handle this. I will not be returning to Fuzzy Peach and will advise anyone planning to purchase a gift card from that business to not do so. They will not honor them."

You guys need to train your sales associates to become more friendlier to customers...
YNYUrINEPY-Z7fgYeJOvvA,qRWzBX1q07ZuPgaTXB_4JA,"Paragon Pharmacy is my neighborhood drug store.

Even though I do not frequent this store for my prescriptions, I am in this store quite often for a variety of products.  It is convenient and the staff are extremely friendly.

Every time I come in, no matter who is working, the cashier behind the counter acknowledges me and says hello.  I assume the owner of this drug store expects that, because without fail, I am consistently acknowledged with a friendly hello!

Even though Paragon is not a large shop, it is rare that I cannot find what I am looking for, so their stock is varied enough that my needs are covered.  I have bought not only hair styling products that I have run out of, but I have also bought curling irons and hair accessories.  The selection is big enough that I can find something in a pinch.

I have also bought vitamins (they had a special this weekend where Jamieson brand, you could buy one and get one for free - you can't beat that) and also any type of OTC medications such as tylenol, gravol and any kind of cold medication.  Like a typical pharmacy, its all there.

At Paragon pharmacy, when you walk in there, there is a little table with various sale items on there.  I always slow down and see if there are any impulse buys.

They also sell kicking horse coffee there for $12.99 a lb, and I have even seen it on sale. (shhhhh.... I don't want them selling out, if I need a coffee fix and run out!).

If you are in the SE, definately check out Paragon in the Riverbend Strip Mall.  A pharmacy is a pharmacy, but if you need those little extras (like kicking horse coffee, and a fun little sale table), why not take a quick browse?

28vLnZjjGnNyL2oDIE7ptA,qRWzBX1q07ZuPgaTXB_4JA,"This London Drugs has been kicking around forever!  I remember when I first moved to Calgary, it was the first time I have ever entered a drug store of this magnitude.  In NorthWestern Ontario, a drug store is a little shop with a pharmacy, and a small selection of toiletries.

My first impression when I first walked into a London Drugs, was that I had just entered a department store. 

What impresses me about this location is that it has a wide variety of kitchen appliances (which I have a weakness for), and it also has a few key items of affordable housewares.  I have bought a few little microsuede ottomans from me, that were relatively inexpensive, and every bit as in style as anywhere else.  Why spend $100 at a furniture store, when you can pick up these accent pieces for $29.99 at London Drugs?

The cosmetic section is always a weakness for me as well.  They have such a wide selection and it is just too easy to browse through and see what's there.  I rarely come out empty handed.

All in all, this location has certainly served me well over the years.  I have never used the pharmacy here, but I tend to shop in there a few times a year, and enjoy the experience."

I have been frequenting it a little more often lately, since I have recently discovered the esthetics salon beside it that shares a common doorway off 7th Street SW.  So to a certain extent, I have rediscovered it.

The gallery cafe has a large assortment of sandwiches, that come with either a salad or fries for under $6.  I kid you not.  

Further, I was watching them scoop out an insanely huge portion of homemade macaroni and cheese to the customer in front of me.  In my mind, that portion would have fed 2 - 4 people easy.

In the same visit, the special was perogies and cabbage rolls, and again, the portion was insane.  There were 3 large cabbage rolls that easily filled a third of the plate.  Then a stack of perogies.  They kept falling off, but the girl behind the counter was persistent about loading it up, and then another wedge on the plate with a salad.  It looked pretty good, but what really surprised me was the large poritions for little money.

As I approached the till to pay, there is a friendly sign over the cashier.  The sign lets you know that their meals are homemade and prepared with care and that they value comments and suggestions to help customers happy and healthy.  Who wouldn't want to support a business like that?  I know I do!"

I would go on Tuesday as that's Taco Tuesday so all tacos no matter the meat are $1.50 each. This spot is a must try and is clearly not getting the attention it deserves.

8oJGvieNjG6JGhRD4iIu5A,gpp515oOUI-grsnRx-76aA,"In general, I hate going to the gym and working out. One day on my way home I decided to pop by and do a free class.

I am now a regular and have been going for a year. The instructors are great and the workouts are incredible. I have lost a considerable amount of weight and toned my body. I also know how to punch and defend myself. 

If you are new to boxing, you might be dissuaded as most people are regulars. You will feel confused and you won't be good at it. However, that's the case with anything new! If you stick with it and persevere you will see results in terms of your shape and boxing technique. Do not expect a boxing tutorial or detailed instructions from day one. You might get some one on one instruction but it is limited. You will have to figure somethings out as you go along.

I also like that I can pay monthly with no contract. 

It might not be the prettiest or the largest gym but it got me into shape.

Thanks guys."
EtW_BZq3jxYJF2YuzZ_Z6g,wVAHI5ByT9vVKo6o9kyldg,"I will start this off by saying I am a VERY anxious person, I will do just about anything to avoid a Dr office. I finally had to do it, I needed a MRI and and ultrasound, I've never had one and was extremely scared. Naturally I looked up reviews, which aren't so good, so now I'm super nervous. 
My appt was scheduled for 8 we arrived at 730 and the front desk ladies were so kind. 755 I was called back, by 8:15 I was in the MRI with the sweetest tech. He played some calming music and told me step by step what was happening, Next was my US, another nice staff member wheeled to the waiting room and within 10 mins I was ushered into the room by another incredibly kind nurse. She also was extremely comforting. After she was done I got ready to go only to be stopped with the disk for my MRI, they got it done within 20 mins!!! We were in and out within a hour and a half. 


Great customer service, super caring, helpful, and no long waits. 

If I ever have to have these things done again, I would definitely go here. 

Highly recommended"
VjnRyaYHqJX7wtxzvgAfkw,iHZZi0HLkrd8gX-iwfDwWQ,"I brought my daughter here to get an eye exam because it was relatively close to home. The office is small, sparse, no frills and clean overall. There was no wait, which I was thrilled about and the sign-in process was easy and hassle free.

Then we met the optometrist. He was curt and very down to business, which is fine. I like doctors to get to the point but there are some who can do that and exude a level of warmth at the same time which puts patients at ease. He was not one of them. There was no ounce of friendliness at all. No small talk. Just straight to the eye exam. Didn't even ask about any problems she's having or whether we might need to discuss anything we're concerned about in regards to her eyesight.

His tone even bordered on slight exasperation when my daughter had a hard time deciphering between which frames she could see better from during the exam. Finally, at the end of the exam, he asked us when she last had an eye exam. My daughter replied, ""Two years."" He then said that her eyes had deteriorated (which comes as no surprised because she is constantly on her phone) and that her current pair of glasses had stopped being effective. He then said, ""That's why it's important for kids to get their eyes checked every year instead of every two years."" Yes, valid statement indeed but it was said in a somewhat masked, condescending tone. I said nothing back because I don't know or care about this man and I didn't need to explain why.

I do however, have advice for those working in healthcare. If you don't know or care to find out enough about a patient, leave your guilt trips out of it. You don't know what your patients have been through. You don't know if they happen to be uninsured, struggling financially, whatever that might be. Healthcare and medical costs are not cheap. Keep your judgments to yourself."

My favorite is the steak. They told me that they marinade the meat for a few days. It shows in the great flavor and tenderness of the steak.  I recommend trying their special rice. Its a great healthy addition to your order.It has peas and other veggies in it. I usually get the two tacos and that is more then enough to fill me up at lunch.
The staff is very friendly and helpful, just speak up because it is hard to hear over the glass wall. You get to choose everything that goes into your meal like Cafe Rio. 
A bonus for me is that they have a veggie juice that taste great and isn't overpriced.

I am happy to recommend Mcken's if you are downtown. Its only a few blocks from Fremont street and perfect for your break during jury duty."

Some people in our basket were scared but the balloon driver really calmed them down with his experience and knowledge we knew we were safe. 
Some people were lost so the company went out of their way to meet them at another place that was close that they could make it to. I thought that was really nice because most company's wouldn't do that. 
It was interesting the process, especially the landing. We landed in a farmers field and then they explained to us that we had to wait in the balloon because they have to ask the farmer whose field we landed in if it's okay for us to be there or not. If they say yes then we can obviously stay but if they say no we have to go back up in the air and find somewhere else to land. Our day was lucky the farmers wife said it was fine so we didn't have to go back up. 
At the end we have to help with clean up which is fine. It's hard work for the people and even after we leave they still have a lot of work to do from just one ride. We have to help fold it and pack it and after the ride because of the time you go it's damp out so the balloon is wet. So when they get back they have to iron the whole huge balloon and dry it so it doesn't get moldy after we have just packed the whole thing up which is hard to do. 
Overall, it was just a great experience :)"

UvKoGBUCrzI1TmAIVu9VYw,Xti9oK0wCXZrike6fgQmCg,"There are no Ghost Armor kiosks or stores near where we live.  However, our kids live in Tempe, so during one of our visits, we went to this mall & saw the kiosks for this product.  After inquiring about it, I bought this product for my phone.  After several months, it came off.  We took it back and the 'kid' (as a previous reviewer said, they DO have 'kids' manning these kiosks), explained that without the old protector, he would have to charge $5 to replace it (even though he looked on his computer & saw we had purchased this).  We paid to have it replaced.  At that time, my husband decided to get one on his phone.  Well, guess what, after several months, his came off, too.  But this time, I kept the old protector in a baggie.  This past July, we were again visiting & went back to have his protector replaced.  This kid then tells us it will cost $10 to replace it.  We questioned him and explained what happened last time & what we were told and showed him the old protector.  He said it didn't matter, it still cost $10 and had no intention of budging.  In fact, he was busy installing one on a new (unsuspecting) customer & didn't even bother to hardly look at us.  We ask it he would check his computer & he could see we'd purchased these.  He again told us it didn't matter, it'd still cost $10.00.  We were so mad!!!  This product is five & diming us to death.  It certainly hasn't been worth the initial cost, I don't care how nice it is.  We ended up walking away TOTALLY disgusted.  My husband told him we would reflect our dissatisfaction with Ghost Armor online.  He just shrugged his shoulders.  What an A@$H*%$!  I wrote a complaint to Ghost Armor on their website after we returned home.  It's now been almost a month and we've received NO response.

Once you have those steps understood, he will move you to intermediate level where more complicated patterns emerge. In both levels, there are helpers to guide and to make the lessons easier to follow. Errol rotates partners so that you get to lead/follow people at different levels. Each class covers both Salsa and Bachata dances. So that when you go out social dancing, you can dance all night long. Did I mention he also hosts monthly social dances for you to practice and have fun social dancing? Errol makes his classes fun and enjoyable for everyone. There are now 4 locations near you.

k2fKijAyvqfrJ6QEMVS-eg,GgkKMu5wuCoh6iYdpstZpw,"I don't have any complaints about the actual store.  It is fairly large with a decent variety of good quality products.  However, my husband and I recently purchased Hunter Douglas blinds from them.  It was a huge ordeal from the beginning.  The design consultant was quick to give us a quote and even extended an offer for a discount on motorization, but unfortunately it all went downhill from there.  We ordered our blinds in December and should have gotten them in 4-6 weeks (January), but didn't get them properly installed until July.  We had to call the designer multiple times to get updates on our order because more than 8 weeks passed and we didn't hear anything from them.  When they finally came in, it turned out the installer didn't measure one of our windows properly so we had to have it sent back to Hunter Douglas to remake.  Also, another one of the blind's motor wasn't programmed properly.  We then had to constantly call the installer get updates on our blinds because he would tell us they should be ready in 'x' number of weeks but we wouldn't hear from him for weeks AFTER what he told us.  He even didn't show up one time even thought we arranged a time for him to come in to install the blinds.  He was difficult to reach and didn't return some of our calls.  When the 'fixed' blind came back, it turned out it still wasn't programmed properly so they had to be sent back again.  Finally after 7 months we had our blinds installed.  One of the reasons why we went with Linen Chest for our blinds was their 24 month interest free payment plan.  But that was a big headache too! The designer didn't seem like she knew how the financing even worked from the beginning.  After our blinds were finally installed someone from Linen Chest called us to get us signed up for a Desjardin credit card which apparently was required for the interest free payment plan.  But even this person did not seem to know how the whole thing worked.  So 2 months later we get an email from Desjardin saying we are late on our monthly payment for the blinds.  We called Desjardin and they seemed to be the only people who knew what they were doing and were actually helpful and sorted everything out.  Linen Chest did nothing to compensate for all the inconvenience and delay even though they knew we were unhappy with their service.  To top it off, one of their promotions when we purchased the blinds was a $100 Linen Chest gift card.  The Linen Chest employee who activated our Desjardin credit card promised he would mail it to us right away. Many weeks passed and we didn't receive anything.  So we even had to call them back to hassle them for the $100 gift card!  If I had known there would be so many problems, I would have rather paid for the blinds upfront and gone with a more reputable company.  It's unfortunate Linen Chest does not do more to ensure their 'home decorating' services are up to par."

My appointment started with a consultation with the dentist and hygienist to get to know my dental history, what my expectations were and me personally- which was a nice touch.

One thing that was very interesting is that I have had marks on my teeth since the time I was a child that no dentist has ever been able to explain to me. The Dr asked me if I had been on heavy antibiotics at age 3, which I had, and explained to me that this was the reason for them and further explained how they form. His professionalism and knowledge is the best of any dentist I have ever visited.

I would definitely recommend Dr. J Ladd Williams!"

I keep giving them the benefit of the doubt but they have screwed up my order every time I have come here since I moved to Phoenix 3 months ago. I'm not exaggerating. Every order through the drive thru has been wrong. Whether it is missed tacos or the wrong burger. Either I'm the most unlucky person or this place messes up everyone's order. You ask for no tomato, nope, you get tomatoes. You order 2 tacos, guess what when you get home, no tacos. I would fire every employee for incompetence and either start over or close this location for inability to find employees that can read. Let alone take an order. Pathetic. No stars. Zero. Fire the whole staff."

Unless you like seeing endless seas of fiberglass-bodied ""32 Fords"" with tweed interiors, and a never ending strip of muscle cars with flames, then don't waste your time. The cars are clean, nice, and as you can imagine, finished immaculately (most are), but its just such a BORING show. The owners seem friendly enough, but most are the ""bought not built"" crowd. Read: deep wallets and no involvement in their cars other than applying Meguiar's wax. If trailer queens, billet/chrome everything, and billionaire banker wanker builds are your thing, this is where you want to be! If you'd rather hang out with guys who actually build their cars and drive em daily and use 'em as they're intended to be used, go hit up the Pavilions in Scottsdale on a Saturday night, or a DriverMod Industries meet on Thu nights in Tempe.

When she told me in 50 years of driving she had never had to make a claim I felt particularly terrible. So I really wanted to make the process as simple as possible for her. I called Dave's office to report the incident.

A few noteworthy things. First, I was feeling pretty dumb and clumsy, but Jennifer was thoughtful and understanding, insisting that that parking lot is a hard one to back out of. We both knew it was my fault, but she was kind. 

And instead of just taking my details and waiting for the other party to call in a claim, Jennifer immediately started a claim for her. This both sped up and simplified the process for the person I bumped.

3_PMeSsHiTP9BiuSxNRhNA,SQ4dIQEdjc3wda85e3d0mw,"Recently I had been thinking about getting granite around my bathroom sink where the sink meets with the wall. It's called a backsplash. So I called a local store that is one of the largest suppliers of all types of stone and tile in this area. I asked a person in the Customer Service Department if she could recommend a company that does excellent granite installation jobs. She said that one of the companies that her store has been recommending to customers for many years is ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE. She said that ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE is excellent at doing big size, medium size, and small size granite and marble installation jobs. She said that her store has never had a dissatisfied customer that has had any work done by ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE. She said that ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE is family owned and operated by the English family.
   So, I called ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE to do my bathroom granite backsplash. Tim English came to my home, took measurements for the backsplash, and e-mailed me a couple days later with all the installation details at a very reasonable price. Tim was very helpful; he invited me to come to ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE to look through their selection of granite slabs to find a piece of one that I liked and could use for my backsplash. Then, I went to ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE and Kristin, the office person who is also Ryan English's wife, was also very helpful. Kristin took me to the back of the building and helped me select a piece of granite for my granite backsplash from a large supply of granite slabs that her company has. Besides being the office person; Kristin is very knowledgable about all aspects of stone work. She said that my backsplash would be ready to be installed in about a week. 
  About 7 days later Ryan called me, and set up a time to install my backsplash the very next day. The next day Chad arrived on time with my granite backsplash and did a fantastic job of installing it. It's a beautiful piece of granite and looks amazing. Chad said that the granite piece was polished and sealed so I didn't have to get that done.
   A final comment : In all aspects of my interactions with Ryan, Tim, Chris and Kristin English; they were friendly, very helpful, reliable, dependable, honest, and extremely competent. Besides doing outstanding marble and granite installation work at very reasonable prices; they are friendly, caring, honest, nice, good people. I highly recommend ENGLISH MARBLE AND GRANITE for any marble and granite installation work that you want done."

I had a quick, but thorough, eye exam where I could comfortably ask any questions I had. The ladies in the front of the store were very friendly and helpful as well. I originally only wanted new lenses for two pair of glasses I had, but after getting home and chatting with my husband, he convinced me to go with an entirely new pair.  I called the store and they were able to stop processing my current order easily. I went in today to pick out a new frame and I was pleased with the selection and found a cute new pair of glasses.

They would put me on hold to start a timer to charge for every second of a phone call and they would both call within minutes of eachother and ask the same questions just to rack up the bill. I was told to send emails to him and his assistant which they would charge me for each of them to read the email.

They lost paperwork that I had emailed them.
 I got nothing out of my experience other then a huge bill they never got me anywhere in my divorce and I was primarily worried about getting access to parental time with children and two months into it they had not done anything to make that happen. I have no idea how they are even in business."

My boyfriend and I went to the drive- thru tonight, ordered 6 piece half grilled and half original requesting white meat (which is extra) along with a half cut sweet/ unsweetened tea. While we were placing our order, the cashier Rachael was singing ""the weekend"" by Sza (that's how clear the music was through the intercom). 

I tried to laugh it off, but my boyfriend hush at me to be quiet. When we got our order, my boyfriend grabbed the drink. I immediately noticed tea was all over the lid. I thought the girl may have over filled it but by the time i got home the tea was all in my cup holder. 

I got home to find all 6 piece original style chicken. I immediately called and Rachael picked up the phone. After we spoke the phone goes silent, I had to just assume I was on hold since she never forewarned me. She never apologized nor showed any sort of empathy. 

I hung up after being on hold for over 15 minutes, I called 8 times each time someone picked up but did not say a thing. 

I will never ever spend my hard working money at this particular establishment again. I rather drive an additional 15 mins to the KFC off of Freedom Dr."

So, for $7.99 you get 5 Flautas fresh from the freezer section at SAMs. I ordered chicken tacos. Shell options were hard shell (pre-made/ packaged, not deep fried), flour, or soft corn. I chose soft corn shells, thinking that would taste the most authentic. What I got was double layered La Victoria shells, completely RAW. Not prepped on the grill long enough to have any elasticity. So they ripped apart the moment I picked one up for my 1st bite. Across the way is Sultans Grill, NEVER a disappointment...better choice by far!"

It was so thick it couldn't dry, which was done with a fan rather than a UV lamp as in most nail salons.  I asked to pay before they painted my nails, but they asked me to wait, so I had to dig into my purse with thick, damp nail polish.

Rare and incredibly refreshing to know someone who really gets the job done, takes responsibility, and goes out of his way to help customers. 

There are so many other places that I could have called that would have overcharged me.

Brought my Vespa in here for a tune up after having a positive initial experience.  Wandered in mid day last Wednesday and was greeted by Troy.  Explained what I was looking for, and told him I'd reached 20 K and wanted the spark plug changed too.  

The service was fantastic.  Was offered a coffee or tea while I waited, and they had a lot of people drop in just to see the new location.  

John worked on my Vespa.  The service was efficient, affordable, and Troy may not be happy with me saying this, but they changed the spark plug, no easy feat when you aren't dropping the engine.  I saw some gymnastic quality moves to get the spark plug wrench inside the engine area.  There wasn't even a millimeter of extra space.  With some precision maneuvering, a lot of patience, and some ninja like ""stealthiness"" they got me on my way.  They didn't even charge for doing the spark plug (part Troy may not have wanted me to mention) which took nearly as long as the service.  These two guys are all about the customer experience, and  gave me some great winter driving and maintenance tips as well.  

I will surely go back here for my brake replacement in the spring, plus any other work I need.  

Highly recommend these gentlemen at FADA.  If you are in a rush, drop it off and pick it up later.  They are busy, the phone doesn't stop, and they are only going to get busier.  

Thanks for doing such great work and super affordable prices.  Good luck in your new location."

So, for indicating they weren't following through on a promotion Topps said they were then some grumpy old man hanging up on me then calling me a saying I'm stupid they just lost who knows how much business after I post it all over social media.......need to hire these guys to do a seminar on all the wrong things to do in customer service, wow, just awful."

UZYTFPPJuO2qOP1S2NkAtQ,_H78T8crtfTTpP5R_sR3xA,"I'll start by saying I don't care for this place, and I left unsatisfied; and I didn't appreciate the cashier's attitude. When we got to the counter, we had trouble deciding what to order because everything sounded so delicious! I ordered the 5pc wing dinner which comes w/ one side. So I ordered mac n cheese and got a separate order of onion rings. The chicken wings were very greasy and fatty and def. weren't as good as I expected. Also, the whole meal costs $7.99 for 5 chicken wing PARTS not whole wings! My side of Mac n cheese was no more than a spoonful and did not appear baked at all but was pretty decent, although my fiancГ© said it tasted like Kraft Premium (the box mac n cheese), any my dinner came with a Hawaiian role, so that was good. My onion rings arrived shortly after the chicken dinner, however I was also disappointed w/ them because it was $7 for a basket and it was more like a side dish that fries would come in, and they were difficult to eat because of the way they were prepared. (You know when someone makes onion rings and the onions slide out of the batter and burn your lips...) The only good thing about this place was the fact that it didn't take forever for our food to be brought out to us, but then again, it shouldn't take long to make food that doesn't taste good.

In conclusion, this was not the thebomb.com soul food place I was expecting. The guy handing out flyers in the alley told me it was Gladys Knight's restaurant so I just knew it'd be good.... Apparently I was wrong. Not worth the money or the space in your stomach. I won't be back."

My forth trip to a salvage yard looking for a fender for my truck after a blowout....

The guy at the counter was cool at least and sent me to the place that had one down the road from a competitor.... Thats what earned the third star...

This yard is pretty clean and organized otherwise from what I saw...

u4Qx84UfTBKpp79_V7nSNQ,UctCnwWuEWHJnSkG3YPA3g,I live in Las Vegas and had to go out of town. My 5 year old was starving so I pulled over to get a Togo order today 9/29 at 2:45pm and when I walked up to place an order the woman who was there to receive orders threw her arms in the air and said what do you want you have an order ahead of you as if inconvenienced at my order. After 15 mins I went to the bathroom and my wife and daughter came in to see what was going on. Our 5 year old was not allowed on any carpeted areas and was asked to stand outside and our Togo boxes were brought out and my wife asked for a bag and the woman walked away and never came back. We ordered a side of French fries that I went back in t get and she said she already packed them. By then we were already late to get back on the road and left it alone. All I can say is if customer service is not your forte then don't be in it because I left feeling guilty that I needed food for my family...
i2WOrWKB1-1GbxGj644Frg,zwG0FSGC5KoXQi40X1IAgw,"The jury is still out on this place. The cinnamon rolls are a nice sweet treat after a long day at work. However, the communication and customer service leaves a lot to be desired. I was given a coupon that entitled me to a free cinnamon roll. The coupon was poorly designed. It didn't have any words on it, just a picture of two cinnamon rolls. When I went to redeem the first one, I was denied by an employee. When I went back the second time with the same coupon On spoke to the guy who seemed to be in charge. He told me the person who designed it made a mistake and that it's suppose to say buy one get one free. After a lengthy conversation and trying to convince me to buy one to get one, he ended up giving me two free mini rolls. I'd like to give them more stars for honouring the coupon, but there was a lot of lip service before he finally gave me the two rolls.

Today I went back for another two rolls. The guy behind the counter asked me if I lived in the neighbourhood. I said yes. He proceed to fill out a loyalty card, without asking me if I wanted it. At the end of the transaction he asked if I wanted my receipt, I said no, and I don't want the loyalty card either.

I could tell I hurt his feelings. Sorry. Next time ask, I know what I want. I don't need you to force things on me."
HLYrDKspXGJ47_UZjPb8Tg,XLtT6dhyQ-5BwHrYe-Nj-A,Lifeline PCS has been an amazing provider to work with.  They have taken care of direct billing through my insurance company with little to no effort on my part.  Everytime I've visited their office the staff is genuinely concerned about my well-being and have provided much insight on things I can do on my own time to help deal with my mental health while providing personalized care during my time with them.  I recommend their services to anyone who is looking for positive results regarding their mental health issues.

mPR-J-9G0W5ML9EfYUZe2g,ub9GRzHj-bGU192hTWaDNw,I should have read the other review posted here on Yelp. I found this company through thumbtack. I set up an appointment at 10 on a Monday morning. I received a call at 10:15 telling me that he would be an additional 45 minutes late. This kind of practice is unacceptable with an appointment that was set. I'm not sure how they do any business if they can't keep any scheduled appointments. I also like to get estimates before I spend a great deal of money on work to be done. Therefore I would not recommend this organization for anybody looking for landscape help.

XUIku9MyNgh3bmRqypSuMw,41IEiep9tz1dArCS73OU0Q,"Got the large jerk chicken for $10.50 plus tax. Food came in pretty quick and had a LOT of meat.  

CHICKEN: Probably 3-4 leg quarters (at least it felt like it). The seasoning was excellent, chicken moist and hot enough to have an actual kick but not too much that id need water. Though it was sweeter than most jerk chicken ive had.

RICE: The gravy they put on the rice was excellent, rice was perfectly cooked.

SLAW: Only downside is the slaw. It was not tasty  and lacked seasoning. Though it did give each bite a good crunch. 

SERVICE: Im not much for this since I did not dine in, but the cashier didnt give off a friendly vibe, at the least. 
Bonus: they do have daily specials ( M-Th I think) for $6.00+tax. But for almost double the price, you can probably get two or three times the amount of food (if you get the regular price large) and eat it for two to three meals, and itll save you a trip"

My first class happened by chance when I left work at a reasonable hour and decided to take a class, somewhere but it had to be close and fairly soon (once I go home, good luck trying to get me to come back out). I did a mindbody app search and Vibe5 popped up with a class called H3.... sure I'll try it!  H 3 is a hot flow class with hip hop beats to keep you motivated!  It was sweaty, challenging and fun! Kacy, the instructor, offer great modifications for both beginners and more advanced yogis which was nice and made the class accessible to everyone.  
The studio was nice and bright with simple clean design, there were male and female locker rooms with bathrooms and the ladies room had two showers which is perfect for when I want an early morning sweat session.
Welcome to the neighborhood Vibe5.  I can't wait to take more classes here!"
lx5eThlldVFN5KmiFr0Ztw,qKA5XennbQeXuT-E3xnD3A,The food was delicious as always but the service was very underwelming. I will not be returning to this location. It took 5 minutes for the staff member at the cash to acknowledge that I was standing waiting to order. I had to firmly place my drink on the counter for her to look up from her computer and ask to take my order. After placing my order I waited 25 minutes for my food. The staff were busy talking to each other not in much of a rush so I thought it was just taking a while for my order to come out. I then went up to ask if the order would be coming out soon and the employee that took my order had forgotten about it. She did not apologize and I ended up getting my food 30 minutes after ordering. It's a shame because I have always loved the food at copper branch but the staff definitely needs to be a little more diligent at this location! A proper apology and some sort of acknowledgement of having made me wait 30 minutes for my order would have gone a long way :)!

I had to come back here just to get a script for one as they don't phone them in. Plan ahead. Otherwise I was very happy with the staff and the good doctor with my exam etc. If listening to Hispanic daytime tv stresses you out, bring headphones as the tv in their lobby is pretty intrusive on ones serenity. It's mostly music and energetic loud talking. I don't even have cable at home so it's a tad trying.

V6iuHzuMa33tb44z4yH8dQ,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,"I literally just used them an hour ago and the experience warranted a 5-star insta-review.

Why? 

I called 3-4 other, local couriers (not the bike ones, because it had to go far-ish) and they either didn't answer, were rude as hell or didn't take credit cards. Who doesn't take credit cards for delivery in 2013? Come on. 

I've actually used Bonnie before, but for the life of me I couldn't remember their name was today as I was frantically looking. Also, when I searched for couriers in CLE, they didn't show up. My last experience was also stellar, but I forgot to write a review. 

Anyways, as soon as I called and spoke a rep a wave of relief came over me. She was polite, took down the info, scheduled the deliveries and took my card over the phone. Within 15 minutes a courier was at my door to pick up the packages. 

The best part is they'll both be delivered today without any more hassle and for only $57 and some change. That's cheaper than sending something through FedEx, UPS or USPS and it's faster (although regional.) 

Bottom line--if you need something delivered quickly, regionally and you need to pay with a cc, Bonnie Speed is where it's at. Plus, they didn't kick good customer service out the damn window."
v65WxzUn8kEMrIkut1ObxQ,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,"This was my childhood YMCA and I was a member for a very, very long time. Just recently I've had the opportunity to hang out in Painesville for a bit, in between moves, and my revisits here are dripping with nostalgia!

First, I don't know how the heck I used to navigate around this place, but I must have been a savvy little girl. As an adult I get a little lost and I definitely didn't remember the cardio room being in the middle of an indoor track, separated from the weights, which are down in the basement. This was probably because I spent most of my time as a child in gymnastics in the gymnasium and in the swimming pool. 

Let's start with the positives. The staff is very nice! Twice we've come in and since we're members at the Lakewood YMCA, we have to explain our situation. They've always let us in for free, which is super-nice. There are some great amenities here for families. There's an activity/adventure room, tumble room, steam rooms, pools, hot tubs and more. The building is an old mansion that was turned into the Y in the 50's, I believe. So, it's oozing with character and history, which is really neat! The only bad part is that it's like a maze in there--but if you've ever been to the Downtown branch, it's sort of similar. Oh--and kudos to whoever decided they needed a drink vending machine that takes credit! Can't every Y offer this?!

On to the not-so-great... 
So, we've established that this place is older, but I swear not much has been updated since I stopped going here in my younger years. Although there are plenty of cardio machines set up, I find it strange that I have to look both ways before crossing a track to get to them. Additionally, they're all outdated, except for one line of treadmills that have TVs on them. I mean, I don't mind watching Netflix on my phone, but I'd much rather catch up on my garbage television (that I'm too ashamed to watch at home) on a larger screen on the elliptical. Sadface! You also have to walk through the gymnasium to get to the weight room in the basement, which is super inconvenient when there are kids activities going on. Unless there is another way to get down there that I'm unaware of--this could very well be the case. Many of the facilities have a strange odor, due to old floor pads that could use a replacement, although they all smell strongly of cleaners, too, so at least they're cleaning 'em! Lastly, the lockers outside of the cardio room are so strange... You need a quarter to operate them, and although you can ask the desk for the quarters, most of them are jammed, broken or just don't work. Then you have to carry around a tiny key throughout your workout. They'd be smarter to just replace those lockers with regular ones, then people could bring their own combo locks--like the Lakewood Y. 

Over all, this is tremendous, family-oriented YMCA branch with lots of history, character, and perks. Just be aware it's not like the newer locations and could use some updates. And don't forget to check out the Perry Outdoor Y if you're in the area!"
2GoA-3SG9SnDmPi2MnxhaA,NfU0zDaTMEQ4-X9dbQWd9A,"I went to the West Side Market on a Saturday morning. Yea, I know. I don't really know what I was thinking either. 

It was a chaotic, glorious mess of old and young Clevelanders bustling around grabbing local goodies. You couldn't walk 2 steps without accidentally tripping on a stroller. Let's just say it wasn't the environment for the easiest shopping trip.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that on days like that, you aren't expecting the best customer service from a swamped merchant at the market. But in a lucky twist of fate, Fosters Meats came through with the perfect amount of helpfulness, knowledge and patience. Hallelujah! 

Jason, Kelton and I stopped by the WSM for a roast and some fresh bread. We didn't think it would take long so we scooped up the first 15 minute parking spot we could find. The first steps we took inside I was thinking we might want to move the car--with this crowd we were going no where fast!

We didn't move the car, but we did start to make our way through the crowd until we spotted the first meat counter, Fosters. We were immediately noticed and asked if we needed help! Wow. So, Jason quickly explained what we were looking to cook and how many we were serving hoping to get some guidance on what to purchase. The Foster's employee cut us the perfect portion of beef at the right price and it turned out delicious! He even worked with the credit card minimum to make sure we were happy campers and got us out in time to move our car!

Polite, quick, efficient, helpful and actually smiling! Yes, I as surprised too! I mean, if I were working on a busy Saturday at the West Side Market, I'd be one crabby broad. I could learn a lesson or two from the Fosters folks, that's for sure."

Eld02k23s3f7Rxxt7WQirw,7-WeMrvOxCH3oJfEWkC5rw,"Every Thursday a buddy and I venture forth to try out new restaurants.

Last Thursday took us to Friends Restaurant. This is a dark, a bit dingy place that features a minimized Persian Buffet.

The buffet consisted of the following:

Salad and dressing
Soup
Stewed beef with beans and greens
Kefte kebab persian style
Saffron Rice
And a different Saffron Rice
Grilled skewered chicken breast pieces
 and precious little else.

We each also had an ayran which is a yoghurt drink. They offered us the ""non-carboned"" one which was welcome relief!

Now to be honest it is ""dead"" cheap at $ 7.99 and I must admit pretty tasty. The owner(?)/manager(?) is attentive and brought us the necessary cutlery to enable us to eat.

I don't think they made money with us but we were only 2 or 4 people in a ""barn"" of a restaurant. It is not a place to take a date, and even my sweet wife might find it on the grotty side. But the taste overall was good. It was only a step in our weekly exploration."

It is very very HOTT!  About 10% of the weights have been stolen.  Hopefully you don't need any 20lb dumbells or 40 lbs fixed barbells because they haven't been there for 3 or 4 months.  The drinking fountain has been warm for a year.  There used to be about 8 squat racks, now there is ONLY 1! and the gym is huge.  There is no chair sit on when using dumbells.  All of the material on all of the benches are torn and ripped to shreds.  The floor is bowing up in the middle of the gym and i trip on it all the time.  The new owner said that he will not put a dime into the gym until people start respecting it.  He has been there 6 months and It's going downhill FAST. It used to be an amazing huge gym with so much equipment. Now it's all broken, stolen and unkept. The gym opens at 12 pm on sundays so hopefully you don't like to workout in the morning on weekends.  Members are dropping like flies.  This gym is next to my house and used to be 24 hours. Now that the hours are limited and the gym is going downhill so fast I think I need to change gyms.

In fact, I would like to put a special thank you to Sharon Orosco, who has made me full more than welcome in recent years as she has not only provided great service but made the effort to get to know me during the experience (over the last few years).  The personal relationships they make with clients is what makes this location unique.  

I made my appointment less than a week ago at a time this weekend (today) when I had the availability, and the team was more than able and willing to make that work for me.  Sharon (and the other team members) have done their research and shared with me answers to my many questions.  They are also great at following up should I have a unique question that requires them to make a few phone calls and get back to me.  

One reason why they separated from Liberty Tax is so they can move their own direction with social media and marketing within our Phoenix area community.  They have a presence on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/salamandertaxoffices) and hosts regular specials ($50 cash back through February 15, discounts through April 1, drawings/giveaways including Disneyland tickets and Spring Training tickets, and even a Cutest Pet Photo contest.

The pizza was delivered on time;  it was greasy, salty, floppy, the cheese slid off the top, it was everything I was hoping for from a New York style pizza!  Awesome 5 stars.

Then again, you can't get any decent New York style pizza where I live (silicon valley/west coast) and I have been craving a good slice for a very very long time... so my review rating is probably overrated.  Not many Yelp users around here so I thought I would help out."

My dad orders the steak. The waiter is friendly and in the winter I like to sit by the fire because it is nice and warm. 

Sometimes we order the linguine pescatore and pizza for take out, it is always delicious.

As we were filling out the app we met the other staff who were also very friendly and welcoming. We had a really good feeling about Noria.

I used to go to a Trade Secrets until the woman butchered me and left me with several bleeding cuts! I then asked a friend for a recommendation and have not looked back.

The proprietor of 7 Senses is a sweet lady, and she works very carefully but quickly! Seriously, I can call her and ask to stop in in 15 minutes and 9 times out of 10 she says yes. When I arrive, she whisks me in and painlessly works on me and is usually done in 10! It's wonderful and she always does a flawless job. At the end of each ""treatment"" she uses a lovely aromatherapeutic spray on my face.
All for only 12 bucks.

She sells Yonka products and a few visits ago I bought a few. I wouldn't say they have transformed me into a goddess, but I do think they work well and may have even improved my skin.

_881w3eUgTJiM-sKvY3DfA,D1QjpmGykVjWG1pbarldaA,"A big fan of the Diesel in Union Square, San Francisco, I was excited to check out this location while browsing the Forum Shops. Never have I met a more annoying group of salesmen (there were no girls) who were almost crawling over each other to get people's business. 

First 5 seconds in the store I check out the watch/jewelry displays and instantly George or whatever is in my face asking if I'd like to see any of them. I can see them just fine from where I am, thanks.

After about 20 more seconds, I turn and walk over to a t-shirt rack. Literally moments after I arrive and start thumbing through the shirts, George is there again, asking me if he can help me get a size!! I haven't even looked at a damn shirt yet! 

Maybe a minute has passed now, and I turn to look at the few shorts they've got. I see one I like and as soon as I touch it, Leroy is there to offer to get me a size. Okay fine, now it's actually useful. This one's a 27"" and I need a 30"". 

He then spends MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES in the back looking and I know he's desperate to find one and make a sale. I almost leave, but he comes back out and says this is the only pair. He insists I try it on. Uhhh buddy, that's 3"" too small (yeah I know, that's what she said), but he *really* insists that I try it on. So I humor him (I don't know why) and *try* it on. Of course it doesn't come close to fitting. But he's crestfallen because he was reeeaaallly hoping to make a sale.

Oh! Spent all that time whining about the salesmen. Forgot to mention that this seemed to be like the Diesel ""Factory Store"" 's Factory Store. Meaning they had just the weirdest collection of shitty ugly lime green and sour purple clothes! Where's the real stuff?? Nothing worth buying here."

That's the slogan for Quick Messenger Service.  It's written at the top of their website.  So I will be rather harsh on them for NOT being on time.

It was arranged for this company to pick up a package at 3:00.  Not before 3:00, not after 3:00, not around 3:00.  At 3:00.

First, they came at 12:30.  They acted surprised that there was nobody there.  After some back and forth, it was explained to them that they needed to come at 3:00.

It's now 3:30 and they haven't arrived yet.  I called them.  They were surprised that they were supposed to be here.  Now they say they'll get here ""as soon as they can"". That's not good enough when you call yourself ""Toronto's Business Courier"".

I'm giving them an extremely generous 3 stars because there's a *chance* that the guy on the other end of this delivery messed up the instructions to them - although he insists that he hasn't.  If I had arranged this entire delivery myself and they had this record for timeliness, they'd get 1 star."

If u get more toppings I found the cheesy level goes up to compensate almost covering over the edges of crust and getting cooked against the sides of the pan in this harmony of greatness....

I have been receiving shipments for years, they call me for payment of duties and taxes whenever I have a package coming into the country.  Fine.

Suddenly only a week after my last imported shipment, on a rush shipment that I paid for the fastest express service, it gets stopped at the depot.  The claim is that it's a ""Clearance Delay"". Tracking shows this notice:

""Detailed broker information is required.
Importer must provide a power of attorney (POA) form letter authorizing Fedex/Broker to clear shipment.""  Meanwhile, I had been preparing for this incoming shipment by calling Fedex every two hours to see if they were ready to accept my credit card payment as usual.  Not today...

According to a major customs broker, this is how Fedex scams you into clearing all your packages through their service instead of an outside broker.  It also ensured I lost a substantial sale.  Meanwhile, my package sits only a short drive away from me, but I can't get it. Until when? Obviously until I cave to their one-sided terms.

When I requested a refund due to the fact he was not helpful he tells me he will give it to me when and if he decides to go to the bank. I pretty much had to keep requesting my money back then he finally decided to give me a check for the full amount. Experience was  awful will never go back nor recommend anyone to go there. As a matter of fact I am going to report this behavior to my legal services group who referred him thru my employer.

I found all of their employees straight forward and helpful.  There are lots of untrustworthy coin guys around the US.  APM is one of the good ones.  (It would be nice to have the people in the photograph identified by name.)"

I was skeptical having never used a cleaning service before but I was very impressed with the way the house looked when they were done. I didn't sleep in my bed for a few days because I didn't want to ruin the way they made the bed! I loved that they left their little touches around the house. Andre was awesome too. I will definitely be using them again when I move into my new house!

They were very professional, courteous and knowledgeable. They explained the process and put my mind at ease during this stressful time. They came prepared with equipment to suck out the water and to dry out the carpet. They stated their goal was to make sure I don't get any mold and I believe they will do anything they can to prevent that from happening. I highly recommend SERVPRO."

Once you enter the office there are three receptionists across the front. I approached the first counter but she was too busy on her phone texting (or playing a game, or checking Facebook, etc.) to even look up.

I looked toward the second counter and she was busy with a client on the phone. 

Before proceeding to the third counter, I looked back to see if the first receptionist had finished playing with her phone when a lady, who was sitting behind the girl watching the whole thing, asked if she could help me.

Even when she asked, the receptionist still didn't even as much as glance up from her phone... wow.

Anyway, once directed to the appropriate area, the service provided was efficient and professional. I was in and out in no time at all. I would definitely come back to this location."

This location is definitely one of the busier places in the food court but they really know how to manage crowd control and hustled us through surprisingly fast.

Now, I like my Whopper as much as the next guy but yesterday I thought I would be adventurous and try their chicken sandwich. I think I was hoping that it would be reminiscent of the ever-delicious KFC chicken sandwich but sadly, this was not the case.

The chicken was breaded and deep fried like KFC's but for whatever reason, this chicken came out greasy and heavy tasting. It wasn't enjoyable at all and I was left feeling gross and wishing I had stuck with the Whopper.

Why have I been having such horrible experiences at Burger Kings lately? Maybe I should pay attention to that."

First of all, we had to go to the bowels of the store to actually find someone to help and then she immediately pushed us off to the cashier when she realized that she didn't have what I was looking for. Really? There's NOOO comparable product that you sell?

Also, it's important to note: They don't carry any of the merchandise you find online in the actual store and when we asked the cashier about purchasing a gift card, we were advised that you can't use the gift cards to shop online. I would have to purchase the gift card online in order to use it online.

I might as well just buy the item online, right?

Ahh, but when you factor in shipping, a $40 item turns into a $60 item. I don't think so.

Let's see what else is on her Christmas list...

C'mon Victoria's Secret, get with the program!"

I chill at the bar watching a few people mill around in the kitchen. Mind you, I ordered a Po Boy. So that's not a lot of prep time, right? Another 15 minutes tick by. Someone utilizes the bar.

Eventually I'm handed my meal and I skedaddle. So the meal. It was fine. Just a hair under below average. Everything was fresh, thankfully. But the fries weren't the best and the shrimp were just fine. Overall not a super experience.

I'm really hoping to change my opinion so I will be returning."

I was bitterly disappointed by their service. My English level is already advanced (total band 7.5 on IELTS) but I still need to improve my speaking. I was not sure if they have a right teacher for my level so I consulted the manager first. The consultation lasted for half an hour. Because I talked to them about myself, my expectation, everything, and they still suggested me to take the course(12 hours ESL private lessons), I thought they have the teacher that is suitable for me so I could give it a try. 

However, the teacher they chose for me was for entry level students. (The teacher was okay for beginners but absolutely not for advanced students) So I decided to withdraw before the class finished. When I was doing the refund, the manager suddenly said ""I knew you will withdraw"", I was shocked, but the receptionist was laughing besides. I had no idea why his response would be like that? and he said ""because you asked so many questions (in the consultation)"". It meant he knew he doesn't have the teacher who can teach my level but he still let me take the course so he can earn the administration fee. (They have a refund policy that if you are not satisfied with your first class then you can withdraw but exclude a $25 administration fee which is non-refundable)

If he could have just simply apologized, I would not be that disappointed. BUT HE PLAYED TRICKS ON ME, HE KNEW I WILL WITHDRAW BUT STILL LET ME TAKE THE COURSE SO THEY CAN EARN THE ADMINISTRATION FEE. 

TO THE OWNER/MANAGER: I hope you know that a company's reputation is much more important than a $25 administration fee!!"

nLoMgljcWzucsKqCIQYMnw,dlOYCLB7XKORL-BE9lnPnA,I had to bring my car because of an oil and coolant leak. When I got there I found out my warranty expired by two days. I was pretty bummed but Steve who helped me said he would see what he could do. Thankfully they were going to cover most of the cost to fix my car and I only had to pay $300 instead of $2000. The fix took longer then expected but I had a loaner car to get me to places so no big deal. Finally after a week my car was ready. However once I got my car back my air conditioning was blowing out warm air and my tire system light came on and wouldn't go away. Immediately I called Steve back and told him the problem I was having. He apologized and told me to bring my car in the next day. I was a bit annoyed that I had to take my car back in again but they were able to fix it before the day was over. Overall everyone was helpful and I really appreciated them helping me out with the car .

But - then again- posting isn't really speaking so.... here I go.

This goes back a year or two ,( or more... hmmmmm - perhaps the fact that I still ruminate over this interaction several years later is cause enough for my post).

We were renovating our Calgary home - Re-digging the foundation , expanding the main floor and enlarging the bedrooms on the upper floors.... a major  undertaking requiring us to vacate the home for almost a year . One of the principal goals of the rebuild was a significant kitchen enlargement and upgrade.

The kitchen appliances , at the suggestion of the principal contractor , came from Trail Appliances  and they were delivered toward the end of the build.  Kitchen fridges , wine fridges , wall ovens , dish washers , a Wolfe range and warming drawers.. i thing the total for the appliances was close to $40K.

The home was to be featured on the Alberta Ballet home and garden tour that spring and , as the date of the tour approached the trades were rushing to meet the deadline. As the Trail staff unloaded the new appliances we noted that one of the Sub-zero wine fridges was dented -( a somewhat subtle baseball sized imprint on the lower stainless steel front panel). 
We pointed out the defect to the crew who called a supervisor . The supervisor called his manager , who , noting that we were now only days away from the ballet tour suggested that we accept delivery of the unit and told us it would be replaced at a later date at our convenience.

We accepted his word and delivery -

I know the following is obvious and my fault.

Following the tour we called to book the replacement installation.  Several calls with creative runaround over several weeks and then our calls slowly stopped being returned . It became harder and harder to find anyone with ""knowledge"" of our situation and then finally , after having our final call transferred around the offices , we were told that , as we had accepted delivery of the damaged unit , there was nothing Trail could do.

I expected as much after the first week or two ....

I accept that trusting them and accepting delivery was my mistake....

But it still isn't cool.....

and so.......  for my one interaction with Trail Appliances...1 star"

I first went to home depot got some samples found a similar one and when I went back was told the smallest piece I could get would be 12 feet long! I did not need that much carpet. The first guy who helped me was rude to me because I didn't know what I was doing but the second guy was nice and explained I could go to a carpet or flooring store and get a smaller piece for much cheaper than the 12 feet of carpet would have cost me. I looked online and found this place. When I went in I was worried I would have to spend a good chunk of money because everything looked so nice, but when I asked the man how small of pieces they sell he said as small as you want, and took us to the warehouse where they keep all their carpet. He was so nice and gave us multiple pieces of leftover carpet to take home for FREE! Being a college student this was amazing. I recommend going here because not only is the customer service great, but from what I could see they have a large selection of carpets and floorings.

QnVZwjV7iSAaG4VN9FvXQg,G8ds1EDzPKKmjOJWCCQEQw,"This Swiss Chalet location is actually an express location and although I have reviewed a restaurant location before and gave them a poor review this review will be the complete opposite. First off..I can't believe that an ""express"" restaurant has provided some of the freshest Swiss Chalet I have ever ate. The chicken is always moist, the fries ALWAYS fresh and even the sauce tastes better. Maybe it's because the menu isn't as extensive and maybe it's because they don't have to plate anything, but this location is the absolute best Swiss Chalet location hands down. 

The cashiers are very friendly, I ordered just fries today and was surprised to see it came with their dipping sauce on the side (extra bonus). The wait wasn't all that bad either as I have purchased fries from Harveys just two kiosks down and have had to wait 10-12 minutes just to get fries. 

I truly recommend this location if you want a healthier choice and some very fresh food."

He's all about building relationships which is something hard to come by these days. There are lots of people who can do a good job, but it's a lot harder to find someone who has the personality and accountability to go with it."

1pha3-IvXY5DPhWBkQFaXA,lQ463Mn5g6_Y-xLXBakm4Q,"tl;dr Overpriced internet for speeds not guaranteed. Constantly having issues with either router, modem, or just signal getting sent to the box itself. Watch out for hidden/surprise charges. Calling tech support is hit or miss, half the time they have no idea what they're talking about but will try to convince you they do. The last time I paid for internet this slow and unreliable, it was $30/mo and I lived in the middle east.

(Mesa Area) I signed up for service in August on the 8th and have had nothing but trouble since. Their equipment has broken on me countless times and I have been charged for them to come replace/fix it. I get treated like an imbecile each time I try to call their tech support even though it is a last means that I call them. Not knowing how to do all the little resetting tricks of the trade would be detrimental to my life since I need the internet for school and work. Speaking of, the internet itself crashes daily at random times between 11AM and 4PM. They have no answers, I have to call when it happens but I'm not home during the week since I'm in school full time. For over a week now, I've been having connection issues with the internet. By connection issues, I'm talking speed. (Paying $$$ for 100, only pulling 30-40, and that's when not running ANYthing or having anything connected except the computer for a speed test.) Again, I've done all the nifty tricks in the book and when I finally got to speak to real life person that I could also hear (side note: Cox, why are you hiring people to work tech support who don't know their way around computer settings?), Julie I believe her name was. She recognized that I've been having multiple issues and escalated the problem. She said she was scheduling me for a 5-7pm show time for the tech on Wednesday (tomorrow) and adding a note that it would need to be closer to 6/7pm because I don't get out of class until 5ish and traffic on 60 is terrible. I need my internet up and running before Friday for my job but apparently that's not possible since they called me today to confirm my appointment between 3-5pm for tomorrow. During the time I will be at school. I called to talk to someone about it and they said there are no notes on the account. The earliest the tech could be over would be Friday evening between 5-6:15pm. 

All I want is good internet speeds and to live quietly doing homework and working. I'm too stressed and battered and broken to deal with this on an almost weekly basis. The unfortunate reality is that it's either deal with the hell Cox has created for me and pay their exorbitant fees for what only works MAYBE half the time or CenturyLink."
UZYTFPPJuO2qOP1S2NkAtQ,BWJqa8B86pwaxK3N7wgs2w,"My out of town friends wanted to eat here, so I drudgingly came down to the Strip to let my friends experience ""The Strip"".  This business is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, there is a $5 parking lot right next door.  The attendant asked us where we were going and we told him and didn't make us pay.  Sweet!  Prior to that we spotted a man handing out Catfish Alley fliers on the street, he told us to park in the Travelodge parking lot.  When we got there, there was a ""park at your own risk"" sign.  No thanks!

We walked in and it was cafeteria style.  The man who took our order was pleasant.  Since there were 4 of us we ordered the 12 piece catfish dinner with 2 sides.  My guests were REALLY hungry.  After we ordered, we sat down and our food was brought to us by a lady who looked ""dead behind the eyes"".  She just put our food down.  If we didn't say ""thank you"" to her, she would have not said a word.  Maybe she was having a bad day..  

The catfish was fillet style and looked kinda thin and flat.  We weren't impressed with the flavor.  It had alot of cornmeal on it with some seasoning.  It didn't have that ""slap yo mama"" taste that I expected since they market themselves as Southern.  The sides were good.  I did like the greens, although it was a taste I have experienced before.  On the way home, I recalled the taste.  It tasted just like ""Glory"" canned greens that you can buy at any grocery store.  I think they just added smoked turkey.  The coleslaw was ok, the mac n cheese was ok, not that nice baked southern style you would expect with a minimum of 3 to 4 cheeses.  The desserts didn't look that appealing in the case.  The cobbler, pecan pie, sock it to me cake and pound cake looked like it had been in there awhile.  I didn't indulge in those, but my friends did.  When they put their fork in them, they looked rather dry.  

There were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant, so it was not busy.  I hope they can get it together so they can make it considering there were tons of people walking by their door not patronizing the business."

James(the technician) called me to let me know he would be here in about 20 mins. James was very professional and explained several options I had. He also gave me the price on the repairs. After choosing what I wanted done he started right away repairing my door. Within an hour he had completed the job. Thanks for the great job James. They also told me their was a lifetime warranty on the springs.
That was nice to here because I have had to replace several of them over the years. I definitely recommend them."
6Xr3eg6VyGJCvE22ttnKsA,VkWUgLZkholyRWagwDpgHw,"Honestly, this place has the potential to be so much more, but really falls flat on atmosphere. The counter staff (well, the one that served us) are friendly and helpful, and that's where three stars come in. The treats are generally very good BUT it can be hit and miss - if you're there at the end of day like we were, you might end up with a less-than-fresh mini cake. My moka chocolat was perfection (sealed up in the outside by a thick layer of glaze) but my date's mini Opera was a bit heading towards the dry side. 
Now, atmosphere: a few things aren't working - the first one being the dirty, unwiped, disheveled tables everywhere. Better for you to do a dessert grab-and-go. 
Secondly, the hideous fluorescent lighting kills any potential ambiance. Add to that the loud hum of the wall of refrigerators that drown out the background music and well, it seems a bit like a morgue. Also, there isn't much for clientele, so it can be eerie. One last cake before you go into a drawer! 
Seriously, though, I wouldn't expect anything more from this place than to get in early, pick up a cake, and make off to somewhere more enjoyable with it."

Cut to two minutes later, I walk back in, shoulders slumped. I had dropped my flowers and smashed them to bits by accident, so came back in to buy some more.

The ladies working wouldn't hear of it when I asked to pay, they said accidents happen and it was thanksgiving, so they wrapped up another exact same kind of flowers for me.

I was floored. Small town love and service in a big city store. Amazing"
l0ojGUQ4IEENt85fS_Ykig,_py9fu2OmDBF2Agy8J83tg,"This place is the worst.
I scheduled an appointment with them for the next day and only a half hour later, I realized I have an obligation during that time and called back to reschedule.  None of my calls were answered (during business hours)
Each and every call of mine went to their after hours voicemail even tho I wasn't calling after hours, I was calling during their business hours.  I left about 5 voicemails explaining I need to reschedule and to please call me back at (702-123-4567).
The next morning before my appointment time was due, I called them again after Thor office opened, but again, no answer, only their ""after hours voicemail"" greeted me.  Ofcourse I left a voicemail again explaining that I can't make it today and that I need to reschedule, adding a plea to call me back at my number as soo as possible.
About 6 hours later after my appointment, I received a call back from the asking me why I called.  I simply said I need to schedule an appointment and the lady asked for my lady name.   When I spelled it for her, she said that I can't be accepted at their office due to a no-call/no-show and they will not take me or schedule me, ever and to find a new doctor.  I explained everything to this lady and she replied that it was my fault for not calling to fix this issue, and I explained that I DID call back, and countless times at that and left numerous voicemails and all of my efforts to reach them during their business hours were ignored on their part, not mine.
I started to cry because they wouldn't even give me a second chance after it wasn't even MY fault.  She said she is going to terminate this call because I'm crying.  I asked her if I could speak to someone else I charge and she said ""No, you can't.""  And hung up on me.   What a joke of a ""wellness/clinic/doctor/healer office""!"

J_J9h8CrXXP8jTtezRJWZQ,CXwHjHxwGDzRTgvU_NdLIQ,"I like that the girls working here are all very nice. It's also a cute space. Other than that I can't find anything redeeming about the place.

I went twice for a 30-min massage and hot mud wrap package (had purchased 2 vouchers from a group buying site). The first visit was so disappointing that I nearly scrapped the 2nd voucher. But I didn't. I waited a few months and hoped the first visit was a fluke. Unfortunately that wasn't the case.

Again, the girls are very nice, so it almost pains me to be so harsh on them. But really, the quality of the service is terrible. The practitioners are very evidently not RMTs and have had very little, if any, education on massage and the human body. 

The massage portions both times were beyond not great... they were bad. This last time I actually left with a pain created in the session during the 10 minutes the girl ""massaged"" my back and shoulders. The rest of the ""massage"" was a scalp massage. Now I love a scalp massage as much as the next guy. But after 5 minutes I'm ready for it to stop. By 10 minutes I'm getting annoyed. And after 15 minutes I have a headache. Maybe if it was given by a skilled person I would enjoy it for hours. But this was not the case here. 

Anyhow, the ""hot mud wrap"" was a thin layer of clay quickly slathered on by hand - not brush - all over the exposed body rather than part by part then covered. I got wrapped up while shivering in plastic, a sheet, and a cotton/poly blanket. I asked for an extra blanket because I was freezing. Then the girl left the room for 45 minutes. There was no music throughout the entire treatment. While I was laying in the wrap the girl told me she had another appointment so someone else would help me at the end. That was fine. When I was ""helped"" I was given a robe and told to go down the hall to rinse off rather than the technician removing the clay with hot towels. In the bathroom, the shower was not working and clearly hadn't for a while because there was scotch tape around the spout. So I squatted in the tub and splashed myself from the bath tap until I got enough clay off that I could dress, go home, and shower properly.

I wont be returning and really would advise people not to go there if they are looking for service and quality at a spa. Sorry."

Not Circle K's fault (but one of my pet peeves) but the limited parking means convenience store shoppers are often parked in front of the pumps, not filling up. As such, I never go here to fill up (there's another Circle K on 15th and Indian School if you are traveling NB or west on Thomas if you are going to I-17)."

YUnEH-ig7UMqKj8lk1a6Cg,klgfC95cE15aEYMmStwlBA,"We were lucky to have TLE open in our community, right at the time when we were searching for a good day care for our 2 year old, who has never been in day care before.  We were dreading the whole process, as we knew it will be very hard for our child at least for a month or so. The staff were very welcoming, gave us informative tour, and addressed all the concerns/ questions we had. They even gave us numerous tips on how to ease in our little one to day care setting. The first two weeks were an ordeal for us, as our little girl would cry for the most part, till we picked her up by mid day. But through that rough time, the teachers, staff were reassuring, and were still engaging her in various activities, trying to communicate with her and finding her needs. She would cry, only because of the separation from home/ parents, but she started to enjoy her time at TLE. One month after, it is a night and day difference. She now walks in by herself, instead of being carried out from car seat while she is in tears. 
She wakes up everyday, looking forward to meeting her teacher/classmates. It is such a relief that the staff were there to support us through the process and made it so much easier for our little girl. 
The facility itself is spacious, clean, with enough toys/ books/ equipment to keep the little ones curious and engaged. The curriculum has inbuilt sign language, manners, physical activity like stretching, hopping, and usually an interesting theme each week. They had water day every week with a splash pad in  the play yard,  till it got too hot and our little one absolutely enjoyed it. It was a pleasure to participate in the fun events they had for mother's day and father's day. 

We are glad to be a part of the TLE family and look forward to seeing our little girl grow up in the nurturing environment they offer."

Linda was my fitter and she did a very good job of explaining how it works and looking for the right one for me. She was not at all pushy, which I appreciated a lot. I am the no frills type, and if they had had a greater selection of that type of bra I would give them 5 stars. Ultimately she found me an Australian made bra that I like and will get lots of good use out of. If you've never had a seriously good bra fitting, I totally recommend this store. 

Don't try to just walk in. They do fittings by timed appointments so they will not be rushed. You will be glad you went."

We hired Bob and his crew to overhaul our backyard and Bob gave us the lowest quote of everyone we received estimates from without compromising on quality. The frustrating part of Anozira is that the owner lacks in basic communication skills necessary to properly communicate vital information to the customer. It started with not being able to give us a for sure start date until the day before they actually started. If you have to work for money like any normal person, you need to know a tentative schedule and time to be prepared for landscapers to arrive. Upon completion we were very happy with the end results. As of this review it has been about 3 weeks since completion and we have yet to see the owner show up and teach us how to use the irrigation system as well as answer our final questions as he assured us he would. After numerous failed attempts to contact the owner via text, calls, and email I finally am giving up on ever having anyone show up to give us these answers and I will have to figure it out myself.

As soon as we walked in we were greeted by Stephen and asked what we were looking for. My fiancГ© is not the average size male and has longer arms then most but Stephen was extremely knowledgeable about suits and how the sizing was. My fiancГ© tried on probably 4 or 5 suits before he found the one that he liked the most. Stephen acted like he had all the time and patience in the world to help us. The pants were a little big on the waist but Stephen assured us that was normal and took about a minute to mark up the pants for alterations. He was extremely kind and worked with us on the price and even took the time to find a bow tie for my fiancГ©. We went in on Wednesday evening and got a call around 3 pm on Thursday saying the suit was altered and ready for pick up! Incredible customer service Stephen!

I also love the sales you can find some really good deals here. You do have to be selective on certain brands though.

x5q2yqZNV_cqanJ_djn2tw,UCiH4NkyIglYCnp9_m2CjA,"Staff as a whole was very polite and personable. While interacting with the staff we discussed putting each other ""into to the wall"" when Carlo, who I assume is the manager, stated we would be kicked out without a refund. I smiled and said we were just joking. 

Ran our race and had a blast until the second to last lap when I passed my friend and we did rub. Carlo couldn't run fast enough from his place behind the counter to grab a black flag and pounce. Fortunately it was the final lap by the time he got to the track and we exited the track. 

Again, the staff as a whole is very good. Young people having fun at a fun job. The facility is worth the $17 to race for 7 mins. 
Captain Carlo on the other hand is a huge deterrent and is enough to keep me from returning."

Nh0uiETUOVDyv_SLv-n3Ng,_wGcE2dvVsnJbHw1Zf14Xg,"Our realtor recommended Stacy Neal / Wallick & Volk to us the same day that we had contacted her to let her know we needed to buy a house. Stacy called me that same day, as well as, sent me information via email so that I could familiarize myself with the lending process. Her and her assistant Karen communicated to me via phone/email during every step, and willingly answered all of my questions. They were upfront about all fees, services they provide, and provided helpful educational materials to me as a first time home buyer. 

Stacy & Karen always checked in with me to ensure I knew what information I should provide at each step to keep the process moving smoothly. Once we found a home and our offer was accepted we asked for a ""miracle"" in that we needed to close by July 29th before our rental lease ended. The team worked relentlessly and met the goal a couple days early! We are still amazed and feel so blessed to have such an amazing lending team during our first home buying experience. 

Stacy adds a personal touch to each transaction. She let me know I could send her photos to show off our new home once we were moved in. True to her word I sent a couple photos via text message and she responded with such enthusiasm. It is so nice having a lender be just as excited as you are when you purchase and move into a home! 

Thank you Stacy, Karen, Stacey (underwriter), and team! I will highly recommend you to my family and friends whenever I hear of them needing a lender. We will also come back to you down the road when we are ready to upgrade into a bigger home when our family grows. 

With great appreciation - Shaun, Becky, & Leah (our puppy)"

I would say this place is good for coffee drinks only.

My chicken club was ok but probably needed to be grilled a little longer and it took 15 minutes. I was really hungry so probably won't be back.

I walked in after work (I bartend) and a tall guy started screaming at me for going onto the back patio to smoke. I finished my first cocktail and my first game of pool and was violently screamed at. I asked the bartender if he knew the owner and he proceeded to tell me he was one of the owners and that guy was actually not on the clock. I can't imagine working in the industry and having an asshole ruin my entire business for me, but apparently this owner was okay with it. My friend and I even tried to go back the same night and that wasted guy was still there. I never post a negative review! I am now!!! I have never meant anything that I've said more than I do now. This guy is obviously a problem considering local bars around say they close just so they don't have to deal with him!

rHv6-vLm2UZzU6jdrII-NQ,FGh5WAvwIqKSoRQwn91qLw,"I'm so surprised Yelper's haven't shown some love to The Yardist.  Time to remedy that.

I had some yard work done last Fall and they did a fabulous and affordable job.  Very professional and helped get the yard all cleaned up, things trimmed and all perfect for the winter.  I happened to only be home for a few minutes of their work and sometimes you feel that you need to be on site to assure things are done right but no with The Yardiest -- everything was done exactly as discussed and the estimate matched the bill.  

The over the Winter they helped me out.  I had a contract with different landscaper for snow removal for the season but they failed to show up when it mattered and left me stranded, would not respond to email or calls to communicate what was going on -- yikes.  I was in a jam but since I had great work a few months earlier I contacted The Yardist folksto see if they might be able to dig me out. Although they were slammed with their prior commitments they did have someone monitoring the email and calls. They communicated throughout the day providing updates about the possibility of snow removal.  

I later asked if they would be willing to finish out the season for me since my other provider bailed.  I appreciated that they were clear about what they could and could not do stating that they would not overpromise.  The owner, Edgar said that he was committed to providing the promised service to customers already under contract so helping me would have to be after those customers.  Now, that's the way a business should run.

Again, The Yardist does excellent landscape work so if you are looking for a consummate professional with a green thumb and solid work ethic then give The Yardist and owner, Edgar Banzhaf a call. The Yardist has all the hallmarks of a good landscaping business: exceptional communication, kind to customers, highly reliable, a solid work ethic, knowledgeable & skilled in all things that grow in soil.  And most important they know how to make your yard look ""all pretty"" which is what we all want, right?

10/23/2017 UPDATE:  The Yardist no longer offers snow removal services. :-(  But they still do great fall and spring yard cleanup and traditional landscape services."

Although my regular gym in Leaside offers spin classes (included with membership), I decided to do some field research; a compare and contrast sort of thing. Let's just say I wasn't terribly impressed initially (a policy of 12 hour cancellation / refund is not stipulated in any of their  email correspondence and It should be more transparent than just a mention on the website.) Also, the customer should be informed ahead of time that the bikes are clip-in only (they provide shoes if you don't have). The reason I mention this is because I have never used clips and it is intimidating for me. In the end, the class was fabulous, the clubs were pretty simple to figure out and I'll be back next week - with a friend to boot!"

I think Yoga Tree has a lot of potential but I don't think it provides enough diversity in positions and classes. At this point I think I can do with less repetition and a greater focus on tension, muscle strengthening and mental endurance. 

The customer service was adequate, they have some really skilled instructors, but I think there are better choices of yoga 'schools' in the area. 
If you live in Thornhill, however, it's worth a visit."

  The flavors are consistently on par and great. The fruit is fresh and the big difference here is the actual yogurt itself. It's more of a crisp flavor and doesn't have that chemically thing some yogurt flavors may leave from other spots. 
 Peach De-Lite is not only the tastiest but the staff & atmosphere make you want to stay. It's like discovering a cool coffee shop where you want to people watch or sit and read a magazine except its yogurt and it leaves you less jittery."

I had no time to find another company to replace them. I was literally outrageous. I contacted them after my wedding, they said they FORGOT!!! Can you believe that?

5 minutes later, another employee came up and asked if I was finding everything ok. He helped me decide on toys for my tough chewer.

the employee who greeted me at the front door found tennis balls for $3 and gave me a $3 off coupon (aka free toy!)

Cashiers were also friendly. I signed up for the rewards program and got a FREE reusable bag with a cute pup on it.

The most important and wonderful thing about this store is THEY PRICE MATCH!! store and online ads. XL Kong toy was $25. I found it on chewy.com for $9  and they gave it to me for that price after seeing the ad. I found 2 other toys that were in store for $15.. Online for $5 (each) i left with 4 new toys for $20 thanks to price matching & the coupon the employee gave me for free tennis ball.

Highly recommend! I live walking distance to  another pet store. Im 10-15 min away from here and i will gladly make the drive for friendly employees and discounts.

I tried on a couple pairs of sneakers (Wings + Horns x Adidas; Nike flyknit airmax), and Alex (the shop's owner) was super helpful and frank. The owner was very easy to talk to and clearly passionate about his business. He also gave us a great recommendation for coffee in the area.

I have no idea why she stays in business if she can't follow through and do her job. I went to have my taxes done in early Feb and after calling about a hundred times through out the span of 2 months I never received a good enough response as to why I haven't received my refund. They rarely pick up the phone calls and the couple of times they did, their answer was always the same, ""it's the IRS that is holding everything up. Your taxes will automatically resend if it gets rejected"". I stopped by the offices about 2 months afterwards and they were closed. That's probably why no one was picking up the phone calls. Also, they don't have an answering machine to leave messages. Well, I called the IRS and they said that they only received my taxes one other time after it was rejected, and that was three days after they had received it. I took my copy and mailed it into the IRS instead and low an behold I checked a week later online and the status said RECEIVED. I will never use their services again!"

There was one measly piece of jerk chicken left, which I wanted to order anyway (since I was craving it) and tried to order it with a small oxtail.  Turns out that you can't do that, so I ended up having to order two small dinners which came with two large heaps of rice & beans (that I didn't particularly care for).  

The total was about $16 and what I got for that money simply wasn't worth it.  The jerk chicken wasn't even jerked; it had been out for awhile and was quite dry.  Against my better judgment, I ate it.  The oxtail was mostly fat and very little meat.

00kW9yjLlphQLoh7G_3i5w,2KpA66oqr0yriUmPo62LKQ,"My experience was not good with this location in particular and with Enterprise in general. This location initially provided a very dirty car that smelled like an ashtray (mid-size). I was late for a meeting so I accepted the car. This was replaced the next day with an SUV upgrade that also smelled bad. I had to drive 45 minutes to this location because the Iocation closer to me did not want to change it. It seems that they have different standards across locations on what clean or scratched rims means. They behave like individual businesses. I accepted the second car and after driving it for two days I found out that my car will be in the shop for another 5 days. I had a longer trip coming up and needed a sedan so my wife can drive it. It was impossible to get one as an existing customer. I offered to pay extra just to get another car and contacted multiple Enterprise agencies, but there was no way to get another car, even if as a new customer I could make a reservation online and cars were showing up as available. I gave up after one more day and went to Hertz, payed extra and got a clean Camry that did not smell like smoke or like someone threw up in it. How hard is it to get a Camry from Enterprise if you already have a car from them? Impossible. They would rather loose you as a customer then making you pay more and exchanging your car. I am sorry to say that I will never use Enterprise anytime soon."

I walked inside and was immediately greeted and asked how I could be helped. I let them know it was my first time in and was looking for some shirts for my boyfriend. They were more than happy to show me around to different areas (including clearance) to help me look for something nice. I ended buying 2 shirts, both of which my boyfriend loves! I bought both shirts in clearance but still ended up with a $63 bill so definitely not cheap. The salesman wasn't pushy and was really helpful. I decided to sign up for the membership program because they told me a location would soon be opening in Chandler, which is closer to where I live. I took my time inside and enjoyed my experience.

zdv667Zq-_PFWtTZsNQ_Vw,Yz40CVeyVSsVY5hB3pJi-A,"I've had more than my fair share of bad dentistry in my 62 yrs but there was light at the end of the tunnel the day I found Dr Devore. Impeccable credentials, totally caring chairside manner, exceptional staff and technicians, he is a perfectionist when it comes to his craft in every sense of the word. So much so that I wouldn't trust any other dentist in the Vegas Valley ever again. I needed new dentures and extensive work that he has graciously referred me to another dentist specialist in California for the rest of the work
I need...but all the work he did for me was nothing short of top shelf, AAA of the highest order. Now my best friend is also seeing him for her extensive dental work and she's gonna be gorgeous when he's done and I bet she will smile for the first time in her life. I can't wait to see what he does for her because he was so great to me in every way. Scared of the dentist? Look no further, he is the best there is....call his office, you will be so glad you did, trust me! And you can take that check to the bank and cash it.  Can you tell I love this dentist? Absolutely ! With bells on! He is so good I wish I'd found him when I lived in Southern California.  I wouldn't be where I am now, that's for sure and my face would be so grateful! You will be too!
I don't live in Vegas anymore but I did for 22yrs and in all that time every other dentist I saw couldn't even come close to this fabulous practitioner. Do your due diligence, look at his experience and then call to see him and RUN in when you get there prepare to be blown away by this guy and his staff. You will love them just as much as I do! The best dentist in the 3 states I've lived in and I will fly back to Vegas in a minute to see him without blinking.  He's worth it!"

VJTUXZy2LkZ1eAhgD3c-Aw,MsvbvdU9DEKfhWNoZMftdQ,"The pastor was talking in that type of urgent whisper that makes him sound dramatic.  To me, that's the equivalent of talking baby talk to a congregation.  It's not real.  I can't stand it.  He also has a tinge of a Valley Dude accent. ie: ""And the Pharisees sort of went up to Jesus and said...""  He says, ""sort of"" numerous times in his sermon. Better than saying ""like"".  But neither one sounds intelligent.

A woman prayed teary, and mournful.  Pleading with God in a syrup sweet voice.  Now, God hears that differently.  But to me, it was like fingernails on a chalkboard. 

They were in a portion of the book of Mark. Seems they stay in a book for many weeks on end.  Like a Bible study.  For my discerning ears, it wasn't a real sermon in that the congregation was getting solid food.  I thought he may as well have been an English teacher.  There were opportunities missed to talk about faith, how Mary was forgiven much, the Holy Spirit, repentance, etc.  Like many churches around here, the sermon lacked cohesion, and Spirit led direction.  Which many people seem to like.  I could hardly stay seated, and around the end of the sermon, I got up and walked out.

God can use anyone, anywhere for His glory.  However, for someone to stay in this church long term, it would be good to supplement with listening to sermons from such pastors as Charles Stanley, or Pastor Jack Abeelen from Growing Thru Grace."

The bharta was ok but the dry curries smelled and tasted like a barn and as if they'd been sitting on the stovetop for 5 days. 

Neither my guests nor I could eat the food. It was very stale and I questioned its safety since it tasted so old and arrived lukewarm. I've had bacillus cereus from improperly handled Indian food and took charcoal to keep from potentially getting ill again.

 I bought my Equinox in November 2105 right off the lot. Spring of 2016 I had a recall notice, that took me a year to have repaired because ""parts were not available"" 
 Now I have a rust issue that I have been trying to have fixed since August. First I was told, the body shop was moving and not opening again until October. At this point I feel I should have been referred to another dealer who could make the repair. In September, I had another warranty issue that had to be repaired. I was shifted to 3 different people in the service bay, only to wind up talking to the first one I saw. The issue was handled quickly, and repaired in a few days. However, I once again mentioned the rust. This time pictures of the problem were taken, a note was put on my file, and I was assured the Body Shop Manager would get back to me as soon as possible. 
 A couple of weeks later, I still hadn't heard so I called and spoke to the Service Manager, who took all my information once again, and promised he would hand this directly to the Shop Manager.
 Today, Oct. 17, 2017 I went in to the service bay again and spoke to the Service Manager, who went to get the Shop Manager, who took more pictures and promised to call me before then end of day today. It is not 4:35 pm and I am still waiting for that phone call.

I was told they can do ultra sounds the same day. I showed up and waited almost an hour before I was called back. They said the girl was on lunch, understandable. Before even taking a test, I was asked 21 questions, including my religious beliefs which I skipped on my intake form because that's not something that is important or any of their business. Then I was asked a series of questions on my relationship with my boyfriend. I felt like I was being judged in a way because I've lived with my bf for 3 years and we weren't married ? And then I was handed a paper with an abortion hotline on it ! I nicely explained that I wasn't there for a counseling session.

She had a mic setup on the van and would tell us interesting info about the surroundings or history or where we're going, etc.  

Zion itself was incredible and TOTALLY worth the trip.  I highly recommend it if you can do it.  Beautiful little hikes and we saw 3 really unique waterfalls, but I think there was a lot more at the park that I just didn't get to see in a 1 day trip.  Be sure to dress for a mild hike: mainly good shoes and layers for cold or hot weather.  The mountains were just stunning and so CLOSE - my neck was hurting from looking up all the time by the end of the day.  There is a fun tram thing at the park that takes you to all the view/trail points. 

Bindlestiff provided a packed sandwich for everyone, I had a turkey.  Decent sandwich for being pre-made, otherwise you can get food at Zion Lodge.  I got some snacks at the gift shop later in the afternoon.  Anyway, it's a long drive from Vegas to Zion, but comfortable and Rachel made sure to stop and give us chances to pee.  :)

*dont let this happen to you

Had gone here (firestone on carefree highway & black mountain rd) for a (cheap) oil change. What I received was much different. Whoever was working on my car thought it was a good idea to top off my coolant/antifreeze to a level right below the overflow cap (too much). Then, when I got my car back, there was a steady leak of antifreeze/coolant from my radiator that I noticed the following day when it left a huge stain on my neighbors driveway. I took my car back to firestone and told them what the problem was (they overfilled my coolant), and I kindly asked if they would correct their mistake and drain my coolant back to a normal level. After being put on hold, in-person, while 3 people stand at desks in front of me not acknowledging my existence, about 30 minutes later some other employee (not one of the 3 over-achievers) came up to me and tried to convince me they did not do this to my car (I know that [I] didn't do it, that's why I took it to firestone?). After some time they brought my car into the shop and drained the excess coolant. The next day, I'm still leaking coolant from my radiator. I decided to bring my car to (2 Wrenches Auto) where they diagnosed a large crack in my radiator where it looks like someone loosened/tightened something they weren't supposed to. Leaking coolant and a cracked radiator from firestone was causing my car to overheat and not run correctly. 600$ later 2 Wrenches hooked me up with a new radiator and installation. While firestone denies any type of liability for this screw up. (Buyer/driver beware) don't go to firestone unless you want unplanned problems with your vehicle in the future. 

I strongly recommend 2 Wrenches Auto near Cave Creek and the 101. Great, honest, fair mechanics here."

I'm glad to say they taste better than they look.   The recipe for the regular dipped donuts was delicious and exceeded expectations.  Cake ones were ok but I'd go back for the  soft white style again for sure.

Unfortunately these had the pricetag of ""special birthday treat"" but really weren't all that special so that's my major issue (particularly in appearance - ick I would have walk right by if I hadn't heard the buzz).  They were good (best in the city maybe) but $11 for 4 is what I think we spent which is a bit crazy.

96fUDgYJUjC_XclWqd0yfg,5dBKAgQE7F7CF-N6qRDkEQ,"Flying in a hot air balloon was one of my bucket list things so when a special occasions presented itself I booked a flight.    

On one side of the coin,  I REALLY regret having booked with Sundance.   On the other,  I'm happy to have checked off that bucket list item now that it's past.

Why do I regret using Sundance? 

Flights are nearly $300 a person and you pay when you book ($400 for weekend flights).  You get a voucher and you book yourself online.   Fine.    What they don't tell you when you're handing over that money is most of the balloon flights are cancelled and you are never getting your money back - they will just keep booking you.  Your flight voucher is only good for a year though and if you want to get them to extend that flight voucher you better have a lot of cancellations before asking.

We had about a dozen cancellations before our successful flight and this is very very common.    Give the flight line a dingle (it's a recorded message)  just to see if they flew today:  (403) 503-0633 -  if it's anything like my unofficial poll,  flights are a go ahead about 5% of the time.   After getting cancelled on,  it's about 2 - 6 weeks to rebook.  That means if you're trying to celebrate a special occasion the odds are not in your favor you'll fly that day - or even within the same calendar year of the special occasion. 

What's involved with a cancellation?   Well...  if it's a weekday (which I picked because it was less expensive) you will need to take the morning off work at minimum (remember I did this 13 times by the day we flew!).   You will be asked to call in at 10:30-11:00 pm  to check the flight line - if you are lucky it's an outright cancellation right then and then you can sleep normally.    If you are not lucky,  they will instruct you to call back at about 3:30 am to check the weather and the reports will sometimes come in late so you stay up calling in over and over.  (do the math on how much sleep you'll be getting here btw)  Depending on where you live - you might have to be dressed and driving before you find out if you're flying because they meet up very early (6am the day we flew  - this changes by the season and is later around new years when days are short).  Realistically you may be half way there by the time you realize you can drive home and go back to bed. 

For me,  going through months and months of sleep depravation,  mornings off for nothing and constant disappointment was killer to my enthusiasm for the trip.  I was barely prepared to fly the morning I called in and hear it was a go.   That meant one of our cameras had a dead battery which made me quite sad. :( 

Moving on to the actual flight....   

Overall the actual experience was pretty cool. 

We met up in the parking lot of the Blackfoot Inn at a crazy early time in the morning.    The wind had shifted so we drove in the van to another launch point.   The crew set everything up and that took quite some time (I had no idea how time consuming this was!  I think it was 2 hours until take off).   You fly in a 12 person +pilot basket  - which I hadn't expected.   You have very little space in the basket,  I was a bit lucky because my quarter of the basket only had 2 people in it so there was a bit more room. The winds really dictate where the flight will be.   For us they ended up being very slow and headed over the industrial areas which was not my favorite view.   We did get a nice view of the core and some farm land by the end.   Being up there was very peaceful - it was surprisingly stable and nothing like a small air craft.   We landed in a construction site - actually on a future overpass of the ring road which was kind of interesting.  The pilot and chase crew were all very good and professional - I felt very safe and have no qualms with the actual experience.   At the end of the trip we celebrated with a little bit of sparkling wine and rice crackers which was a nice touch and a tradition in the sport. I'd say by the end it was close to 11 by the time we got back to our cars.  The flight itself was only about 1 hour of that 5 hour period.

Overall I'd really liked my flight.  Hated everything leading up to it.   I know there is another balloon company in Calgary that has a ""don't pay until you fly"" policy and I really like that model.   They are not as large of company and I can't speak to their safety record or whatever else but I like the business aspect.  I would have liked the option to just give up on flying for a while at the peak of frustration - I hate the feeling of obligation because they had my money and being forced to keep trying to fly when I wasn't excited anymore. If given the chance - DO go hot  air ballooning but know what you're getting into and check out the competition!

I find the prices to be higher than value village and highly inconsistent - items you might consider to be cheaper will be over $10 and items from popular brands or  expensive-looking will be cheaper. I find this really odd but the same thing is true for the keele location in North York. At least you can find better deals at this location but I had to put back alot of things after failing to justify the price in relation to the item of clothing. Especially true for their shoes. Took a few pics to back up my opinion. I won't be going back there cuz the prices are too high (in other words it's just bunch of junk in there) and the area ""cough"" patrons are pretty sketchy and the whole environment is disturbing.

Last points, the staff aren't very helpful and I wonder how they are handling shoplifting losses with literally no staff monitoring the change rooms. The good part about that is you no longer have to abide by the 6 item limit!"

Omg seriously only one employee worked on that department and he don't respect his working hours! At the end I left my order to another employee, he said to call me once it done. They call me by 6:30pm!!! Omg, this is horrible services I ever have, and the pick up also took me 30mins of waiting with no one in line up. I was just wait for them to bring me my order. Hell yes!

n5S6BuEvl96RgCTafnYkvg,Krk5hIOG70pDfaZdbz-P9Q,"My partner and I were in Cleveland visiting friends Halloween weekend and we needed a quick lunch after our flight.  Our friends knew this pizza place had just opened, so we decided to check it out.  The shop is a no frills, delivery-and-carry-out-service-only store in a strip mall, which was fine for our purposes.  

We ordered a sausage and pepperoni pizza.  The crust was new to me.  It had the buttery taste and texture of pan crust, but a flat cracker edge like thin crust.  I generally prefer just one or the other, so it threw me off a little, but it was good.  The sauce was pretty tasty.  While we were waiting, the owner told us an Italian grandmother from Cleveland's Little Italy comes out to make it.  It had that great marinara tomato flavor, but with a meatiness to it and not too sweet.  The sausage and pepperoni were well-spiced with a bit of fennel in the sausage.  They were a little on the greasy side, though.

I was surprised how inexpensive this was - about $10 for a medium.  It will probably be good for people who don't want to spend a fortune on the high-end, suburban fare all around that area."

Joel led us around all day & he had an interesting story for everything. Most tour guides are happy to read and repeat a little about a stop. Joel knows some of the oddest stories which made our otherwise pedestrian jaunt into a trip through the many gold and silver rushes in Nevada and Arizona. 

You also see the value of a man when something goes wrong. The recent time change (Nevada follows it & Arizona does not) caused a hiccup in scheduling. So what did Joel do? He improvised a little & made sure all of us on the tour got to see what we wanted. 

I hope your excursion is as fun as ours was."

Middleton is a quaint town and is adorned by beautiful lush green trees as you come in to down town from Cross Plains. My eyes were peeled as I love the whole small town feel. As soon as we got off the car I snapped the first picture of the front of the store.

We were greeted and welcomed right in. I immediately mentioned to the Lady that we were referred to try their one of a kind and North American award winning artisan cheeses. She had a smile from ear to ear and her face lit up and she began to walk us thru and showed us the award winning cheeses and there was a story behind every one of them, from the name to the taste. 

As she continued thru the store, which by the way is stocked with a great variety and they also sell souvenirs and knick knacks. She then said to feel free and e polite on our own and if we had any questions we can ask her and she will gladly let us try out some of their most popular cheeses. 

My husband and I looked around and picked out a few things. We asked her about the cheese curds, as we were told that if the cheese curd don't SQUEAK, than it s not fresh and has been refrigerated. So she let us try some cheese curds and to our surprise they sure did squeak! So of course we had to grab a bag to come home with and show off with our neighbors. 

As we were trying out the cheese samples she brought our, she told us about the first generation that started this. I enjoyed her story and she pointed at the pictures where the fame house is and that just add more charm and value to their products. I love the fact that he makes the cheeses by hand and cures them in a cave and the process is just amazing. 

Sweet vanilla cardona - is MY FAVORITE OF THE ONES WE TRYED. I am not a goat flavor kind of gal, but this has a light goat flavor with sweet vanilla beans and hints of caramel, coconut and nutmeg. 

Canaria cheese (named after the Canary Islands ) sheep goat and cow milk hand rubbed and cured in olive oil. It has such a Burberry taste mild and very delicious.

They are named after many European areas because the Cheese Master Sid, traveled there a lot. 

Bessie Blend - (named after their sales manager) nice in taste but what got my attention was at the last bite it creates an infusion of flavors. 

Picture of yellow and white half and half. Mobay Cheese - half goat half sheep. 

We were told that the following by Sid's sister:

""If cows milk was $10.00/ gallon, Sheeps milk would be $90.00 / gallon because there is not much of it and it's so good. Supply and demand. It's hard to milk a sheep and there are far less sheep than cows. 

She went to school with Craig Culver owner of Culver's restaurants. Which there was one restaurant right in front of the cheese store. There was a story behind that as well. On a visit to a Culver's we were also told how great of a person he is from the staff. 

My husband and I were very happy that Sid's sister (who was running the store that day) opened up and shared the Cooks family story.

We asked for the recommendations and were told to try the pulled pork or the brisket so we ordered one of each.  The pulled pork was definitely the winner.  The meat is shredded and without sauce so you can choose from the variety of sauces at the table.  Smoky flavor and crispy ends but a bit dry.  The brisket was less successful in that it was drier and tougher and absolutely needed sauce.

Surprisingly, the sides were the real stars on the plate.  Sweet potato fries were delicious, crispy and served with coarse salt.   For someone who grew up on collards, Rotuno's collards were just right...smoky with shredded pork and just enough tang.  The mac and cheese was thick and creamy.    The Texas Toast was decadent and reeked of garlic.

They have a kids menu at $4 and the restaurant has a casual takeout feel so it would be a good family choice for a change of pace.  There was a steady stream of pick up orders walking out the door so it's obviously garnered fans in the short time it's been open."

I went with a high-end ceramic tint last year, and it's been keeping the heat down really good.  It makes the car look extremely clean & sleek.  I should have probably went a little darker, but I went with the maximum legal darkness to avoid any chances of getting pulled over.  However, it's pretty commonly known that the police do not site people in Vegas for any shades of tint.  All in all they did an excellent job, the tint is holding good, and I would definitely recommend them."

The staff are all friendly and can direct you to some great wines if you ask.  They do not sell at the LCBO so the prices are about 40% cheaper than if they did.  They have a great variety, including some beers (they have a brewery on deck).  

Definitely be back as I saw quite a few interesting wines.  They even have their own vodka and brandy."

Several people referred me here and despite living on the east side of town, this place is worth the drive. The Bass Place specializes in all things related to bass guitar and the three guys who work there (all bassists) will really go the extra mile.

I made an appointment for Saturday to purchase a bass. The owner, Dennis, spent two hours with me, showing me all the instruments I was interested in and answering all my questions. He also suggested bass teachers and led me to my current instructor, who is phenomenal.

I recently had to come back to get some adjustments done and was well taken care of by Randy and Lee. It's like going to a friend's house where it's easy to lose track of time because these are truly cool guys passionate about music.

This is truly a unique store with a great reputation nationally.  During one of my visits, a Nashville session player called in asking if a particular instrument was available. Before shopping here, I did some research and they will beat competitors with selection and pricing. They have been in business over 20 years are the real deal.

I never took the time to call or acknowledge what happened or write a review. I truly believe my daughter had a root canal that she did not need.  I was also instructed to have an urgent root canal on the front of one of my teeth because I had a so-called infection that I needed anabiotic's for immediately. I got a second opinion. There was nothing wrong with my tooth. I remember going in taking time off of work for teeth a cleaning and the doctor never came out because he was on the phone with another dentist. On a second occasion The hygienist did my cleaning in maybe five minutes and I was sent on my way. Things may have improved over the years but the way this practice started out was truly unbelievable.  I believe it was a means to make money by suggesting procedures that were completely unnecessary. Like I said every time I drive by I feel so angry that they are still in business ."

It is a big complex with 4 large sized indoor soccer pitches and decent turf. They just upgraded a couple years ago from some absolutely horrible turf that would cut you up but now it's a lot better (although still not the best). 

It's a great place to come and rent out a field with your friends when you NEED your soccer fix in the middle of winter (which seems to be at least once a week for me), fields cost around $110 / hour but if you get a game of 14 people going it won't cost much per person. They also serve some donuts and hot dogs and they're alright and not TOO overly priced which is a plus. The facilities are always clean and the people do a good job taking care of the place."

The barbers seemed to get a little chatty, felt like that May have been contributing to a longer wait. 
I hadn't been able to grow my hair or beard out because I was in the military. After I left the military I grew it out for three months and went in with no idea on how to style the facial hair. Was kind of embarrassed about that (seems like an essential man skill) but my barber was really helpful and pretty much just asked my opinion on different styles and took the reigns herself. The trim and shaping was quick and looked really good, my wife was impressed. 
The shop was clean and well kept. Some or their supplies in boxes were kind of sticking out in the corner, but it didn't look unorganized. Just like they didn't have a place to put that stuff.

My hunt for a local printer whom, I could deal with face-to-face, lead me to PrintPlus.  They offer a full product line (even website design)  at reasonable prices comparable to the  on-line printer but, here's the best part, with actual personal, professional service.

After running a diagnostic, he fixed the problem within minutes and told me how to prevent future issues on my roadtrip to Texas. When I asked how much I owed him, he said ""just give me enough to buy my guys some beer later.""

Their shoes are really interesting and people seem to love them.  They have great sales people who really want you to be happy with your purchase.  One of the sales guys was helping out a gentleman and actually busted out a pant leg, to show how the new shoes the customer was trying out would look with pants instead of shorts...that's taking customer service to a whole new level.  I worked in retail at the store level for over 10 years...this kind of service is unheard of (at least at chain stores).
I'm not super adventurous anymore as it pertains to footwear, but I think if you invest the time to find a pair that fits you, you'll really love them.  They seem to mould to your feet if you can find the right pair.

Shopping for a bathing suit in off-season in AZ is challenging.  #1 - it's tough to find a decent selection.  Most department stores have a very limited stock and Target doesn't even sell them until January.  #2 - bathing suit shopping is never fun especially during holiday season when workouts get cut short and holiday parties with endless amounts of food and drinks replace them.

So, I was on a mission to find a new bathing suit for an upcoming vacation and I was not looking forward to it.  A friend of mine suggested 'Exquisite Swimwear' so I decided to check it out.  I'd seen the cute bathing suits in the window before but this was my first time going in.

I received a warm welcome when I entered the store and later learned that the owner (Pauline) was who it came from.  I looked around on my own first and admired all the cute suits, accessories, cover ups, and more... then I felt a bit overwhelmed so I asked for her help.  When I told Pauline what styles and colors I prefer, she pulled a bunch of suits for me to try on... I narrowed it down to two suits and she was very honest in telling me which one she liked better.  (I hate it when you are shopping and the person helping you is not honest!)

Needless to say, I walked out with a new suit, so it was a productive trip... I was impressed with the store, the selection, and even the fact that in the dressing rooms, they offer disposable panties to try on suits with... of course the suits have hygienic liners as well, but this was an added bonus.  I was tempted by the clothing, headbands, sandals, and more, but I was on a mission for a bathing suit, so that's what I got!

I totally recommend Exquisite Swimwear to anyone looking for a new bathing suit.  It's a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for... designer, good quality swimwear, great selection, and service too.  As I said before, bathing suit shopping is not fun for most of us, but Pauline made it a very pleasant experience for me.  Now onto my next mission, get some suntan on this pale skin of mine :)"

We waited what seemed like a really long time to get water and to order... this place is a two man operation.  It was just Chef/Owner/Manager Leonard and one other employee when we were there.

The service was far from attentive but the food was enjoyable once it arrived.  I had the Greek salad.  The others at my table  enjoyed their sandwiches once they figured out which was which.  (They mixed up the two of them and served them backwards).  The fresh bread was a treat and the hummus was an odd texture, but it was tasty.  

Would I rush back to Bambino?  Probably not.  And I definitely would not go if I were in a rush.  But if I felt like a Greek salad, a panini sandwich, or fresh bread and was not in any kind of a hurry, I would give it another shot."
LQ8abSdcYQyOOiWy4m5JFg,qSBEOeoZYqfTMsNFLHoyiw,"After my doctor prescribed physical therapy for my knee, I looked to find a facility that took my insurance, then I looked at the reviews.  I chose Advanced Manual Therapy because of the many good reviews.  I would like to add mine.
  
I love them.  I thought last chance effort before I have my knee operated on.  The very first day I was impressed with Betsy's examination and initial treatment, Monica's magic hands, and Dominique's quiet efficiency at the front desk.  I thought yeah, but it's always like that.  They get you started, get your money, and then slack off.  

I was so wrong.  They maintained a high level of excellence the whole time I received treatment.  I always felt I was the most important person there even though I observed the staff made every patient feel that way.  They don't overbook, and they don't just leave you go on your own.  Every time I went, I got some type of therapy: ultrasound, tems, cupping, deep tissue massage. 

The owner Mike Rantissi is there frequently.  He is very hands on with his business and the patients.  One time when I came in, my knee had blown up.  He immediately pulled me into a room to work on my knee and relieved the swelling before I left.  He clearly appreciates and praises his staff, leading by example.  I extended my therapy one week beyond the initial script, and (not to give myself bad luck) I think it's all better.  I'm not even thinking about surgery. 

Something else I was impressed with is Betsy's talent as a trainer.  She was supervising a PT student, Rikesh.  She gave the perfect balance of questioning to support his learning and observation of his skill.  In my opinion, Mike and Betsy's teaching skills help to make the whole staff so professional and superior. 

In summation, I want to add two thoughts: go to AMT and do your stretches at home.  Good luck with your healing."
ZP7EDnFEQSYkwq4uQ-Escw,o2rgo7amwFR9NGQkMGxrgg,"I'm desperately hoping that the CLOSED information about this school gets changed ASAP! I am so passionate about this institution, and I think that parents and student need to know! 
P.S. 
ATA is short for Advanced Technologies Academy! 

I began my Substitute Teaching career (let's be truthful, this is NO career, it's a ""simply in the meantime"" kinda gig) three years ago at the request of my highly educated, teacher of a mother after many-a-job hunts came up as dry as the desert we reside. My very first day on the job was subbing for my mom's class (she teaches World History AP @ ATA), and I was flabbergasted by these children. WHAT CHARACTER........SUCH A DESIRE TO LEARN!!! I thought to myself, ""Oh heak yeah, this is what teaching is all about!"" It was such a good day, and it inspired me to take more jobs at other schools! 
=) 
That SMILE could only last so long....... I was quickly disturbed by the utter lack of moral, ethical, & educational responsibility students at other Middle and High Schools had. DISTURBING!!! These children at other schools feel entitled to everything. ""You owe me this!"" and ""I deserve a better grade!""...........where I come from, that S**T doesn't fly! YOU EARN IT, plain and simple! They think that a money tree will blossom in their yard one day and that learning is a futile concept (we all know that they didn't use the word FUTILE though!), but you get the idea. It's a ridiculous notion and it makes me both sad and scared for the future of these children. Now, this is not to say that ALL other schools are bad and that teachers and students don't care.....that's simply not true. It's just that ATA is like this hidden gem of a high school and at the end of the day, if I haven't spent my time subbing there, something just doesn't feel right. 

I want people to know about this institution and I want them to understand the depth of GREATNESS that this school embodies! ATA's mission statement reads: 
The mission of Advanced Technologies Academy (A-TECH) is to empower a diverse student body by teaching academic concepts and technological skills and by instilling in students the importance of effective, responsible application of their knowledge to succeed in a highly competitive, technologically changing world. 

Yeah, yeah, YEAH......you're probably thinking, ""Lots of places attach a ""Mission Statement"" to their building or website, but how many actually ad hear to it?"" 
THIS PLACE DOES! There are core values at this school that drive the student and teachers alike to better themselves and the people around them. Hell, these people INSPIRE ME! There's a genuine LOVE of LEARNING in this building and a desire to go off and take on the world. These kids have the moral fortitude to do what's right and at the end of the day, they understand the GIFT OF FREE EDUCATION THAT THEY ARE RECEIVING! 
(sigh) 
Let me continue this tangent a moment longer..... 
~These children are producing the HIGHEST Advanced Placement scores in the state! 
They are receiving full ride scholarships to IVY freakn' LEAGUE COLLEGES!!! 
~They are ambassadors for business and travel the world on school holidays! 
~They are National Merit Scholars! 
=) 
This year I will watch my FIRST group of students walk across the stage as they receive their diplomas..........and I feel like the proudest mother ever! Well, maybe not mother because I'm only ten years older than this group, but definitely a proud sister! =) 
To me, this is the ideal high school situation........ 
~Small class sizes (16 to 26 ppl) 
~High achieving students 
~Teachers that LOVE their job 
~And opportunity to become something GREAT in an environment that wants exactly that for you! 

I don't know much, but I do know this, and I make sure to remind my students: 
YOU ARE GIVEN ONE OPPORTUNITY AT A FREE EDUCATION AND IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO RETAIN AS MUCH OF THAT AS YOU CAN!"

It's the most popular restaurant in the underground, sadly. I go on occasion when I'm visiting what's left of the stores here (the Coles closed recently). The most recent time I went, the cashier took one order at a time and waited until it was packed in the bag before taking the next order. Another staff member stood beside him and made change, then disappeared into the back. People dropped out of line and went elsewhere. The food was okay--what you'd expect from Burger King."

I happen to live very close to the location in Southern Highlands but I always end up at this location because of work. Of all the times I have went, the staff has always greeted me upon entering and are more than helpful in helping me find something. 

Since this IS a boutique, if you like something, don't even think about it, just buy it. They will more than likely run out of your size quickly because these pieces are hand selected and only a few of every size is ordered. I like that. 

The only troublesome thing is that the dressing rooms here are more ""open"" than the other location and the fabric to cover you isn't thick enough to make me feel shielded from the public eye. - UPDATE: Thank you Selena for your comment on my review and I have to agree that I now feel safe and sound in there :)

Given the impact I has lot quite a bit of mobility but Dr. Maynard worked with me to get it back! He's also the chiropractor for the Arizona Cardinals. I figured that if anyone knows how to put you back together after being hit with that much force, it's probably the guy that fixes linebackers all day.

The Beaderie has a very upscale boutique/gallery feel to it. The owner and others working the shop seem very knowledgeable about their craft, and will tell you all about the origins behind each of the special beads they carry. They are also very good about offering design advice if needed. 

The Beaderie caries glass, seed, imported, hand-painted ceramic, crystal, semi-precious, and vintage (my fave) beads. Lots of them. Maybe not as many as other places, but the selection seems to have more variety and pizzazz than most. 

I had to deduct a star because on the one occasion I brought my daughters-- hoping to pass on my inexplicable love of little colored glass objects to them-- the woman behind the counter was rude.

That same day he emailed me with the whole one fold brochure i originally wanted. Almost nailed it right on the money.  I was at my PC at 9 pm in the evening closing out my day and made my suggestions via e mail.
Joe emailed me right back at 9 PM !! I made my suggestions and he e mailed me back with the changes within the hour.  I approved them and he sent me an invoice for payment. This was a Monday night.

Employees were on their walkie talkies saying where is my table for nine. And no one would respond. It wasn't until an employee walked and asked, I believe she was the manager, for a table. The table we got was right in front of us. Cleaned. The lady in charged asked the employees for table wear and everyone ""fixed "" the table.

v3RwgM8ILuDsx70SvBHAhQ,9P8-9EUP-aEnuisqUYt5jQ,"Thanks to Yelp I found such a welcoming and caring vet for my kitties. Dr. Elkin Seto is extremely knowledgable and approachable as is his crew of vet techs. If you have a question about your pet and you're a client of his, he will call you back the same day! Usually within a few hours if it's urgent.

I originally brought my 2 sick cats here for a check-up and unfortunately one of them had terminal renal lymphoma. After several days of overnight stay, I was encouraged to take him home and spend quality time with him before he passed away. Because of this recommendation, the fees were incredibly reasonable compared to what I probably could have been sold by ""upseller"" vets. In the end, I had a few days of quality time with my kitty at home and was spared a hefty vet bill and invasive treatments that would have ultimately done nothing to prevent the inevitable.

My other cat was also seen with minor issues and he's thriving at 15 years ""young"". I was convinced the older was going to die from depression and was so worried about his deteriorating state and then all of a sudden a miracle happened. A tiny absolutely adorbs kitten was brought into our life thanks to Dr. Seto and his crew. I dropped by to buy some cat food and say hi and just passively mentioned that my remaining cat was inactive, stopped grooming and missed his bud. Long story short, they were fostering some kittens and I became the mama to a gorgeous 6 week old Calico!! And they just gave her to me for free?! 

Now my older senior kitty is happy and healthier than ever and he and the new kitten are cat buds! A match made in heaven. 

The crew at this vet all care about their animals which is evident from seeing how they occasionally foster rescues free of charge. I am so impressed by my entire experience here thus far.

You can tell that people love this place from the reviews and the fact that it's always busy, people coming in and out with their cats and dogs. It's the place to be if you need a vet!

but i was still hungry.  so we stopped in here and i had a pepperoni slice cut in two.  it was hot.  it was relatively thin.

when you are the bride and groom, you get your own green room where you can make yourself up, get down and dirty and take some behind the scenes pics. 

what is the best about this place is who caters the food.  its flow restaurant and only flow.  if you were to ask anyone who attended our wedding what the best part was, it would not be our speeches, the witnessing of our joyous union or me on the dancefloor.  it would, of course, be the food.  nothing short of heavenly.

so i suppose this is kind of a combo review because youll have to go to flow restaurant to taste that goodness or get married here.  Either option is not cheap.  in fact it is certifiably expensive.  but you do get some good memories...unless your the drunken groom...then you barely have any memories."
_T2KCuqqzpy6W3jNV4sqzw,pwpKFY_WRFddFj7B_w578w,"I'm an elite Yelp member and I try to say positive on all local businesses. 

That being said I can positively say stay away from this body shop. I was with Nationwide at the time of my front end accident and they told me to go here because they were part of their ""blue ribbon"" program. In my eyes this meant that this shop had clout and were a reputable shop. What I didn't realize this meant was that nationwide would basically get substantial discounts in return for them sending most of their bodyshop repairs this way. 

The owner and his wife run the shop. My accident happened in 2011. I called them and they told me to bring it in. They took pics and then sent me on my way. Told me it would take about a week to get the bumper, side fenders and new hood in. They would repaint and reattach. They also ordered new headlights.

Showed up a week later. The only positive aspect was they took pics which were available online to show the progress of the car throught the week.

After a week I picked it up. It looked okay. He never replaced the undertray which was damaged in the accident which would lead to problems down the road. He also forgot to cover the back of the car which got some overspray from the primer (How this happened when he painted the front of the car is beyond me. I'm assuming they were painting a car next to mine.)

Here is where I am dissapointed with his service. After a week the bumper started falling off. Also the new headlight he put in started getting condensation in it which proved to me he never actually replaced it. I called and tried to set up an appointment but none of my messages were answered. After getting him on the phone he told me I needed to set up an appointment to come look at it. I showed up and he told me it would take more money to fix! Are you kidding me? The insurance company and I coughed up $6k so you could partially put it back together and then not want to fix it once it was falling apart? He told me I must have hit a curb and knocked the bumper off. He would not take responsibility for his lack of quality work. 

DO NOT GO HERE. I complained to Nationwide to remove them from their repair shop list but my complaints went unheard.

I ended up going private party to redo his shotty work."

Wow! What a blast from the past this place is! The owner of the store is so sweet and inviting, she has carefully hand selected each item in the store herself. Everything you see in this store dates back to as far as the 30's to the early 80's.

If you have the patience for it, and are all about the thrill of the hunt, you may just find some treasures here waiting to be discovered. A 70's style TV(not a replica) was playing Elvis while the tunes in the store were provided by a very old record player and her vinyl collection which I thought was cool.

She is also very flexible in her prices as well, so don't be afraid to bargain here. Wifey got a vintage hat box for only $20. Stop in the next time you're in Boulder City!  ALOHA!!!

LEED training seems to be the flavor of the month, thus this brings out many ""Vendors"" wanting to get their share of the monies generated by the latest fad.  While I have not taken a training course with this company, I did sign-up for one for $695 (2-Days).  I had something come up and need to cancel and was charged $50.00 Cancelation fee.  The way they have set up the Google purchase of the class, I believe, is confusing.  The cancelation policy does not require a confirmation ""click""  (I have read and agree.. blah, blah, blah.)   In my opinion, this is very misleading.  I ask for a reduction in my fee (I canceled 9 days in advance) but to no avail.  This company also uses a gimicky (Waiting List Only) through Google on classes.  The argument for me not receiving a full refund was that they had to coordinate the caterer and class size.  They probably will sell my seat anyway.  Like I said, I've never taken training through this organization so I cannot comment on that.  However, I can warn you to be CAUTIOUS when signing up online!!! They will not work with you regarding refunds.

Anyways, I just signed a lease for 12 months with OneProp for a nice house here in Charlotte. Things were going great. ""George"" the branch manager seemed very helpful. We got our applications in, got approved, and had a lease signed within 3 days. I was ecstatic, loved the home layout, nice neighborhood, you get the idea.

Fast forward to 24 hours later. I have my new KEY ( yes singular, 3 tenants, one key, I know, I know, make copies, not the point). Get to the house this morning to get our cable hooked up. First time seeing the house inside since our initial walk through, and wow, my jaw dropped when I walked through the door. The house looked exactly like it did a week prior, with several repairs promised not done. Then I started noticing the cleanliness. The carpets were immaculate, and I commend them for that, because old used carpets kind of freak me out, sorry I'm weird like that. But everything else was disgusting. Light fixtures had grime, dirt, dust. Garbage left in the house everywhere. Whoever moved out obviously was not much of a cleaner. But that's where I THOUGHT the property management company was supposed to step in and make it ""move-in ready"" as they say. It was obvious that no one had cleaned a thing, there were holes in almost every bedroom wall, not even patched and sanded, forget about painted. They never turned on the furnace and hot water heater for us. There was food actually left in the broiler (sweet potato fry anyone?), as well as baby bottles left in the dishwasher. Garage door broken, master bedroom window broken etc... That is only the half of it, I don't want too long a review because I know I skip a lot of them. Basically they failed badly at making a new home ready for the new tenant to move in. COMPLETELY FAILED.

Moral of story, go elsewhere. George (branch manager) seemed super nice and welcoming until he got his money. Now he has not returned e-mails, and had  rude phone conversations where it seems like he is trying to blame us for moving in before the house was ready. TELL US THE HOUSE IS NOT READY, WE WILL LOOK ELSEWHERE. Of course they would loose clients then, oh well. Lost us already, I am counting down until Jan 2013 so I can move again!!!

My family is not doing great on money, but they impressed upon me the importance of having this work done. Even though I had to tighten the purse strings for a bit, I agreed. They had me sign that I understood the estimate is ""just an estimate"" and the actual amount could be a little higher. 

Fast forward to me getting a bill in the mail for the actual amount - it was DOUBLE what the estimate said. Is this their scam? Get someone in to do a cleaning they can't actually afford with a low low estimate, then slap them with a huge bill? This is an incredible hardship for my family now, and after talking with their manager Elizabeth, they are not budging on the charge. 

I've even called my dental insurance, and they said with just a phone call to them, they could have provided an ACTUAL cost rather than an ESTIMATE, in which case I would have understood what I was getting myself into, and would have simply declined the procedure. 

I'm so disappointed, and I would recommend people not go in and support their shady business practices that have put a hardship on us."

In reality, ReedHein is a clearinghouse for all kinds of other firms and they turn your file over to one of those other firms without your knowledge or approval. The promised coordinator and monthly updates are just an illusion as well. My coordinator went from one person, to team 3, to a non-mortgage department, to the legacy team and I have not gotten any updates from any of them and they don't return phone calls or emails. When you call, you get to speak to the assistant who answers the phone and looks up your name. She gives you the standard everything is great routine and when you ask to speak to the person directly involved in your exit, she refuses to give it to you. I actually sent a letter to Brandon Reed at their corporate offices with my specific concerns and got a one line dismissive response saying they would contact me if they had anything to tell me. I'm still waiting. In March 2018 they told me that Standard Timeshare Transfers was unsuccessful with the exit and that they had given my file to another firm who was able to accomplish amazing things and that I should be hearing from them. In May, when I have not heard from anyone and with the assistant still refusing to give me contact info, I did some research and called the firm who was suppose to have been handling the exit. They have no idea who I am and do not handle exits from my timeshare. They have also received calls from other ReedHein clients in the same situation.

A lot of dirt still remained inside both side mirror enclosures that could be sprayed out easily.  There was also still some dirt left on the body of the car behind the side mirror.

mztfl4sOleSMtcp-ERw32Q,--Qh8yKWAvIP4V4K8ZPfHA,"This is such a great dance school! I love the fact they teach samba! It is a grueling one hour of intensive cardio and learning to coordinate your arms, hips and legs. It's not an easy dance to master, but boy, do you sweat and release toxins and stress at the end of it!

The samba classes are structured into 8 sessions (1hr per week) and are advertised as beginner/intermediate. Smart to do so because it is tough to progress in skill level (or at least for me). I met another girl who took her 1 year to master the arm movements.  But you keep returning because Albena is a phenomenal instructor who really knows how to dance, and she's right there next to you, sweating. She's passionate about dance.

They also offer Cuban salsa classes and Afrofit classes. The Afrofit are the cardio classes, but trust, me, a Samba dance class is just as effective as an Afrofit class for cardio.  The Afrofit classes are next up for me.

In terms of pricing, I think it's reasonable.

0DQ31asd4IeOTI7dkZ3OXQ,p_514Yo8SndKB7dCvGdvWw,"My last night in Vegas and we ended up here at the great Sea Harbour Seafood Restaurant for dinner. I originally had a craving for some steak and shrimp but didn't know where to go. I was accompanied by my parents and ang tee from Australia. They were limited with time because they were going to attend a show in juan hour and 37 minutes from the time I had my craving. For me, not so much as I just planned to chill at the hotel room, watch ESPNg highlights, get piss drunk & eventually pass out. So I was being more considerate to them if anything. Aw how cute.

We stayed at Caesars Palace so instead of wasting our time trying to find a place for steak & shrimp we ran into Sea Harbour since it was right in front of our faces and most convenient for us. My mommy asked, ""hmm..what if they don't have your steak & shrimp here?"". I immediately said, ""it's alright, I am Ong Gree as hell and I won't be a fastidious brat for the current moment."" (Ong Gree eckwalls Hungry by the way).

So during that moment in time, my mind state wasn't so damn selective and my mental memory quickly switched from a fat juicy steak & succulent shrimp to hopes of a fantastic Chinese dining.

He shoots the J and Scores!

The service was great and very welcoming. Provided a comfortable atmosphere from when we first walked in to the second we had to jam. They were always quick to fill our waters (that's a big deal to me because I always pound my ice waters with my meal like it was a Steel Reserve 40 oz or something. Naw just kidding. But possibly something similar to that.)

We had calamari which was GOOD. We had the pork fried rice which was GOOD. We had Beef with Bittermelon which I highly requested for the night. My ang tee from Australia was sore prized that I eat that stuff because most people can't handle that bitter taste. It is an acquired taste but I have conditioned my buds to love it. I also explained to her that after you eat bittermelong it enhances your taste with everything else and provides your ice water with a sweeter taste. (I wonder if I am the only weirdo that experiences this?) We had some other items that I just can't remember now because my physical memory is failing me. I bet we ordered sweet & sour chickeng and chow mein. Either way I had no complaints with our meal. I would like to highly recommend it.

I really wanted to compliment the Beef with Bittermelon because I found it extra GOOD.

I would like to thank Sea Harbour Seafood Restaurant for a fantastic dinner and for erasing my craving of steak & shrimp. I was completely satisfied and my stew match wasn't angry at me at all.

I would like to take this moment to stand up and applaud this place.

Upon leaving she was told her balance for today's services were $71. She said ok, and said I thought today was FREE? Receptionist then said only the consultation part was free, so she paid it.  Upon leaving, she began to question this, and I recommended that she call the office back for explanation.

She even took him to the website to show him the offer, and he said ""he hadn't looked at the website in awhile, he finally agreed to refund her money, but in the end he was very unprofessional, and condescending to her, as was his receptionist.

My daughter was waiving to me and smiling so she had a great time the office was honestly cute and well thought out for the kids. So they come outside with my daughter and tell me she has no cavities and that she was perfect. So i tell my daughter to smile and i notice a small brown hole on her tooth and ask the student dentist what is that she said idk the doctor didnt say anything about it. So they take her back the doctor kind of looked annoyed checked my daughters mouth comes back and says her enamel is really low from not brushing her teeth and that she has to come back in for a fill but what i cant understand is why a student whose going to dental school and a graduated dentist didnt notice it but me who has never went to school noticed it. So she tells me that the tooth would cave in if i dont get the fill for her. So now my daughter would have lost her tooth now had i not noticed it? Wow? I definitely want to bring my daughter back umm noo. Theres only one doctor who ""knows"" what shes doing checking up on 10 kids at a time ? There's just not enough time in my opinion for her to give every patient an appropriate exam. Very dissapointed"
dukZ5XrXMMu21SnGjPF4_g,00BBQyAf61So0FY5tfhW2g,"When we saw that there was a new tea place in Ross Park Mall, we got very excited. My girlfriend and I love tea, and we'd always try to stop by Teavana on our trips to the mall. But coming into Capital Teas was a different experience that hooked us almost immediately. The display island enticed us, glass jars of every tea brightly lit from every direction. The two salespeople there welcomed us in, encouraged us to pick up the teas, smell them, try the numerous samples they had. They were enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and warm; they seemed genuinely happy to have people there to chat with them about tea. 

From that first visit we were converts. We make Capital Teas our first stop now every time we go to the mall, our individual cups of teas fueling the rest of the trip. Justin Rodriguez is the store manager we see there most often. His charisma is seemingly boundless, easily drawing us into conversation, always excited by the latest tea or device. This has led us to buying several to-go tea mugs now, one with a central tea infusing system, and one that turns upside down to steep. Both mugs are very clever and have increased our tea drinking throughout every day even further. 
We love this store and the people who run it. 

Now when we have to go to the mall, we start thinking of what tea we can get as a treat and hope that Justin is there so we can chat with him. His charisma is channeled into his work, making him a dangerous salesman - but one so friendly you're glad to buy from him. He may be the single best customer service employee we've ever had the good fortune to interact with. His energy never seems to be dampened. We always leave Capital Teas feeling refreshed and energized from our interactions with Justin, tea and tea products in hand. Writing reviews is not something we do very often but we want to thank Justin for everything, and encourage everyone we can to visit Capital Teas as well."

One tip: the bathrooms are really crowded so bring your child dressed and ready to go!"

IQsktrZ6qFr3mgPqB_8yUw,dGz_AXphmffe6OdT83ls6g,"I never go here during the day, and should have kept it that way.

I was there yesterday 5-2-2016 at approx. 9:30am.  And of course, as usually it takes one crazy woman who has pictures to pick up, an attitude, and a friend in line to mess it up for everyone.  I wish I could review that lady on here.  

Not enough cashiers until the line is really long and after everyone has been waiting, 2 more cashiers show up and people just butt in front of you.  And then of course there is the man that has to butt in front of you while 4 other people are already waiting and doesn't even offer the other people waiting to go ahead.  Mind you the cashier did say she could help the next person in line but didn't tell the guy that other people were ahead of him.  She should of but she was put out cause she had to stop scanning the cigarettes.  Which was the 2nd time cause of the crazy woman and her pictures. I understand that things need to get done, but scanning cigarettes and not checking behind you every few minutes to check the line is not logical in my opinion.  Especially when the one cashier is sooooooo slow.  Logic would dictate that you would keep an eye on her and your patrons.  Just saying.

But after all is said in done, NO MORE day trips to the Middleton Walgreen's!!!"
3gn1tgwQ8PTdjXt0oBAV5w,dGz_AXphmffe6OdT83ls6g,"After reading the other reviews, I was quite shocked!  I have had nothing but great experiences from this location and always leave satisfied!

John helped me get my tablet and was fantastic!  I wish now I would have asked some questions about memory cards before buying online (Ebay) cause my 64g did not work.  My fault completely because I had not done enough research.  Which brings me to today.

After doing some quick shopping around for 32g micros, Office Depot had the best deals.  While looking around, I had stopped into Walgreen's and a young man helped me price out their cards which are horrible prices.  I told him what I was looking for and told him that shortly I would have 2 64g cards if he wanted to buy them because he wanted more room on his phone.

I went back to Office Depot and Waii greeted me.  (It was by chance that it was her since she was the lady that said goodbye to me on my way out the first time I was there.)  I told her I was trying to beat the clock and asked her about the return policy just in case the 32g didn't work.  No hassle return!  Gotta love that.  She quickly and efficiently helped me in and out.  Thank you Waii!!!!  =)

Just a side note - I was able to get home and get the cards into my phone and tablet and make it back to Walgreen's, but unfortunately the young man couldn't use the 64g cards.  But he didn't have to wait long to find out because I was in and out and well taken care of!!

Thank you again Waii!!"

MABUFBGH1m6FKeoK9vcLNA,pnVD2uEUWZU-HE5_hG_b-A,"I contacted this outfit to install an autostart that I had pre-purchased online and also pre-paid for the installation through Installcard. The manufacture of the autostart had recommended and sold me the pre-paid Installcard. They sent all instructions and installation kit specifically for my year, make, model, and the smart key for my vehicle. It's supposed to be 100% complete and compatible for my vehicle. It explicitly states that no other parts are needed, with instructions to the installer and a phone number for the installer to contact if there are any questions. Installcard sent me Leo's name and number. When I called to set up an appointment, right off the bat he said there was going to be additional charges because ""the kits are never complete"" and ""aren't made for our hot Arizona summers"" When I tried to explain to him that the manufacturer was from Arizona and that it was supposed to be 100% complete with everything needed for the install, he said and I quote, ""Well it seems you think you know more than me, so I'm going to decline this install"". I said ok?... and he hung up on me. I can't believe anyone could stay in business very long treating potential customers like that, and I don't think he is an installer that Installcard would want representing them. He didn't know the manufacture of the autostart or anything about me or my knowledge of automotive electrical systems, yet he dismissed me as if I was wasting his time on the phone. I wouldn't let him ever touch one of my vehicles, and I hope anyone who reads this won't either."

W7BiJB9c2e_qz-fQLR_yMw,AYHRCHExEZ4kCd0sYUpeeQ,"I've been here twice in the last three years and thoroughly enjoyed each time.  The park is clean and well kept, it's not too crowded and the staff is friendly.  The rides are fun, especially the steep speed slides.  I also enjoyed the lazy river.  The wave pool leaves a lot to be desired, for me, because I couldn't ride the waves; although it was popular with a lot of other people.
The only drawbacks are that the ground is extremely hot during the summer, so be sure and bring some water shoes, or take your chances and leave your flip flops at the bottom of the slide.  The only other drawback is the price, it's $26 for each adult and that doesn't include $7 to rent a locker and the expensive food."

MpvKVWQYDpbiQ1RA3bzXsg,GHoG4X4FY8D8L563zzPX5w,"Thai Express is a quick-service chain that offers Thai-influenced appetizers (imperial rolls and spring rolls), salads (mango, shrimp and noodle, and chicken and noodle), mini soups with noodles (tom yum soup and regular soup), quick stir-fries (tom yum, noodle soups made with chicken broth, curry (red, green, and yellow), fried rice, pad thai, and pad see ewe.  Located conveniently right off the Metro, we had seen ads after ads of this place, so we were curious in checking in out!  We tried the General Thai Beef (mango panko beef that were super crispy, covered in a sweet chili sauce, over steamed rice with tons of bell peppers; this was actually pretty good!  The sauce itself was thicker and coated the beef strips, the veggies, and the rice really well; rice was of the typical 'fast food' version where some bits were under- or overcooked), and the Pad See Ewe (we opted for the chicken; this was pretty inedible, as the noodles used were of such low quality; it was dried out, not cooked all the way through, and there was no sauce that dressed the chicken or the noodles; the dish was completely flavorless).  I really think I would get cravings for their General Thai Beef, and I sure would order it if was set as one of the options at a food court in a mall; I personally think it's better than the other quick-service Chinese joints.  The Thai influence isn't really there, but for something quick and freshly stir-fried, this place can really satisfy some hunger; they really stuff the take-out boxes (which the designs are pretty cute). The place itself is bright and has plenty of seats.  There's also some great music videos playing, so you can jam while stuffing your face.

They offer both men's and women's clothing, and was famously known for their black and white pieces; however, they have turned into having more of formal, vintage-esque type of styles.  The store itself is one of the best boutiques I've seen from Club Monaco - the marble floors, the pillars, and the lights that shine on each outfits were really pretty to look at.  I was even more pleasantly surprised that they had a little glass case of vintage designer handbags (aka Chanel) that you can purchase!  The quality and the condition were all quite exquisite; don't be afraid to ask the SAs if you're interested in looking at these more closely!

This is always incredible to me. On top of that, they provide speedy solutions to whatever banking needs I have, and sound advice around RRSPs, investments, and asset management. 

Additionally, when I was recently visiting NYC, TD had banks everywhere. I'm not even kidding--I must've seen at least five around midtown Manhattan. When they say they are everywhere, they really aren't kidding. This is a bonus because lots of machines mean less banking charges--getting cash from my home bank was simpler than getting it from a different one."
ejkMsqhck5vU_LhhuW7bcA,6gubzYIQXX1UtyFBAuzH-A,"This was the WORST business  I've ever interacted with!! I tried to rent a specific water slide/pool for my son's birthday party. The lady told me they were sold out of the one I want to for day, so she recommended another water slide. I agreed to rent it. I was told that they would be there between 12-12:30 to blow it up. They finally showed up at 1:15, after all my guests (43) kids had arrived. I asked them what happened, and they laughed and said, ""got stuck behind a train.""( I didn't know we had a 45 min train delay on Sun in Phoenix.) By the time everything was ready for the kids to go on, it was 2:00. 

Within 10 min of the kids playing on it, the pool water was completely drained, and a huge leak was revealed. I had to call all 43 wet, disappointed kids back in. My friend called Bounce Then Slide and said that the whole thing was a major disappointment. The guy responded back to her, ""Well lady, ever since Obama's been in office, the whole damn country is a disappointment."" She was dumbfounded at his response. They came to pick up the water slide in the middle of the party. They gave my money back, except for the deposit. (which I am still trying to get back) 

Then, on their way out the door after packing up the leaky water slide, the staff started handing out business cards to the kids and adults that were at the party. I have to laugh, because I guess that was their way of saying, "" Here's our company. Make sure you see our name and never call us. "" lol 

I have never written a review on here, but this warranted one, for sure. I'm just a mom who wanted to have a great birthday party for her son, and it ended up being a nightmare! Do yourselves a favor, and don't book Bounce Then Slide for your upcoming event."

My parents had just moved into their retirement home in Mesa and needed a few items to fill in some gaps. At Do Over, we found a beautiful rattan chair with a matching ottoman. It showed some wear but was structurally sound and very comfortable. It was originally from the Pottery Barn but it only cost us $70 (we came in during a sale). 

Do Over also offers restoration classes for those interests in taking an old piece of furniture and giving it a new look. Give them a call to find out more as I'm not sure on all the details. (Because of this, they sell furniture in various stages of wear.)

This hotel is high end rustic and a bit of log cabin flair.

Let's talk about hotel hospitality, cleanliness, luxury,  customer service, oh and they are pet friendly too! ($20 deposit for the night). Which was refunded back to us due to no pet accidents or damage.  The hotel employees are delightful, kind and professional.  They also have a restaurant that serves hot traditional breakfast and it is also pet friendly as long as your pet is well behaved, doesn't bark and isn't rambunctious.

We brought our well behaved dachshund with us Bo Monkey and how lovely it was for all three of us to lounge in hotel billowy pillows and duvets that felt like sinking into clouds of joy and comfort.  We slept in a gigantic king size bed with a fireplace and other comforts such as A/C, luxurious two vanity bathroom sinks, spacious shower, automatic toilet lid lifter and self cleaning toilet, plus coffee and tea maker, cable tv and music stations, free ice and spacious open closets and mini fridge to keep your groceries cold and fresh.

The staff at the 29th street location is another matter. Slovenly and quite rude. Hardly wonder if you are human. Calling the name then turning around and walking back without a greeting customary of humankind. Checking out? Having been a patient for several years you might think they would be familiar with your normal routine. Copay: $30 Oh we don't have change for cash. Run the card. Oh wait you have an additional copay of $15. Run the card again because no change for cash. 

Here's an idea, find some staff that actually enjoy working there and with patients. Fire the rest. It would be better for them because maybe they'll then find work they enjoy. Being miserable every day of your working life is not good. 

Next idea. If you don't take cash, please post a sign and make it large enough to read. After all your patients' eyes might not be the best.

I have always used picture people for photos and will definitely be returning. Our experience with the actual photo shoot was minimal at best, with maybe 2-3 shots taken of every pose. With a toddler, this gives a pretty low success rate. We ended up with significantly fewer pictures to choose from. After choosing our pictures, I realized, during checkout, that we wouldn't receive the actual prints on CD for over a week. I was promised a ""phone call and email"" to confirm the pickup date I was given. After the pickup date came and went, still with no word, I called several days later, to see if I could pick up my photos. I was unable to reach anyone during normal business hours and left a message, which was never returned. Several days later, I got ahold of someone, who informed me that they never call or email anyone, I should've just come to pick up my photos. 

Finally aware that my photos were available, actually getting in to pick them up was another nightmare. They aren't open at all on Tuesdays. And they take ""lunch"" from 2-3  the other weekdays. When I arrived at 1:50 on a Wednesday, they had already closed, with no one anywhere to help or listen to my concern. 

We will never be returning. Sorry, Picture People, we shouldn't have ever left you."

oSS0p8TeF9BTTD7QWtO6gg,nZ88aHeN5tuqhaj1p1eprg,"When we moved to Las Vegas from California, we didn't know who we should get to handle a renovation on a condo unit as there seem to be fewer and fewer trustworthy contractors these days.  A neighbor that we had met who lives in our building, mentioned in passing that he had a great contractor who was trustworthy and professional and was just finishing up their condo.  So with the recommendation, we called Eddie.  

Eddie from Aria Remodeling was quick to stop by for a quote - and our reno job was going to be quite an undertaking!  We explained that we like things the way we like them and have already designed the work that we wanted done.  He made a reasonable bid on the job (in the middle of the other contractors we interviewed).  From the moment we agreed to the contract, he was BY FAR the MOST PROFESSIONAL, MOST CONSIDERATE, MOST TRUSTWORTHY, MOST POLITE, MOST PLEASANT, MOST RELIABLE, MOST HONEST, IMMACULATELY CLEAN, ARRIVED ON TIME ALWAYS, VERY THOUGHTFUL in actions - MOST OF ALL - he's a man that lives by the motto I was taught when growing up ..... ""Don't do anything unless you're going to do it right!""

The employees and subcontractors that Eddie knows are held by him to very high standards, and I've seen that over and over again in all of the projects that Eddie carefully oversaw and even the parts of the project that he himself handled!  UNBELIEVABLE!  I often say he should be the ""Contractor to the Stars!"" This man and his team are just the best!  I have never posted any review anywhere in my life with this much excitement and confidence!

If you are looking in the Vegas Valley for a contractor - BE SURE TO CONTACT EDDIE OF ARIA REMODELING!  You won't regret it and soon you'll be singing the wonderful praises of Eddie and his crew!  I can tell you, now that the project has been completed, I had to write this type of POSITIVE REVIEW!  It was completely earned and I'm a tough one when it comes to project renos!  We completely trust Eddie in our home with keys when we are away - his entire team is also completely trustworthy!  Do yourself a favor, contact Aria for your next reno job!!!

Eddie is the ABSOLUTE BEST there is! PERIOD! END SENTENCE!"

z5y8FooP3QHp1r_AMoTDpg,mb_8jXannipO5T5V5kGXiQ,"Oh. Burger King (BK). How I've grown up with you. In high school we discovered the miracle of BK's ""perpetual pop"". They had moved the beverage works from behind the counter to the customer side. You could now operate the soda fountain yourself! It was like the elimination of the Latin mass in favor of plain English. Pay for one cup and we could sit in BK all Saturday afternoon drinking coke. You have to understand this was before Cott cola broke the price barrier and forced Coke and Pepsi to lower prices. Coke was a rare, rare treat.

Then came 1984. I had won a Reach for the Top Scholarship (my team came in second place in our regional finals). The scholarship turned out to be just cash that went right into my bank. And it went from my bank to Burger King over the course of a semester or two. How it sustained me.

And then came the Where's Herb campaign. One of Burger King's biggest and least successful ad campaigns was launched in 1985. For weeks via in-store ads, billboards, and television commercials, it teased its customers with the enigmatic ""Where's Herb?"" slogan. Eventually it clued its customers in to be on the look out for someone named Herb. If you spotted Herb, you would win $5,000. Alas, Burger King failed to tell its customers what Herb actually looked like. That was the other part of the gimmick, see. Keep 'em guessing. Create ""buzz"" by having people debate each other what Herb actually looks like.

 None of that happened.

The net effect of asking its customers to find Herb -- but not telling anyone what Herb looked like -- was that Burger King caused its own customers to harass each other in its stores.

Mercifully for those who liked to enjoy their fast food in peace, Burger King finally revealed on Superbowl night Herb to be this geeky looking fellow in a too-tight, loud suit.

By this time, no one really cared.

Lost on the vast majority of fast food consumers was the message that Herb had never actually tried a Whopper, hence he was a geek, hence you were a geek too if you've not actually bit into one of Burger King's moist, juicy flame-broiled patties.

It was too much of a leap in logic for most burger consumers to grasp. Since the ads were telling customers that Herb was spending all his time in Burger Kings, what the fuck was he doing there if he wasn't eating burgers? Most assumed Burger King was trying to tell us Whoppers are the burger of choice by geeks everywhere.

Burger King blew $40 million on an ad campaign that only managed to drive off customers. The burger company's sales plummeted during the campaign. Advertising Age magazine labeled the ""Where's Herb?"" campaign the ""most elaborate advertising flop of the decade"". Other advertising insiders have more charitably called it ""simply one of the greatest fiascoes in the history of advertising."" 

Eventually I moved to Korea. A white man, such as I am, in McDonald's in Korea is a pernicious stereotype if there ever was one. But it seemed okay to be in Burger King. I could never figure out the economics of BK (or any burger place). If you went to the grocery store to buy ground beef, it would cost you more to make  a simple burger. 

Upon returning to Canada, what with Harveys and Wendy's, BK was on the outs. I had my fill. 

Then I heard about their new fries. I had to see. I just had to.

Oh BK. How could you."

Just down a bit from the more established  Capriccio, the Puff Cafe is a new Asian style coffee house. Puff Cafe hits all the Asian coffee house markers:

- The name. Puff. Meaning?
- The cute, nonsensical slogans ""relax in Puff"", ""stay in Puff""
- The interesting mishmash of styles: pictures of London under a Moroccan style tented ceiling
- Free wifi
- Small, beautiful, fussy desserts surely to make your woman squeal ""Oppa is Gangnam style!""

I like the nice (if small) covered patio. Attentive staff keen to make your first visit a good experience. A great date place, for sure. 

The major coffee chains (Starbucks, Second Cup, Timothy's) have really dropped the ball on the stretch between the Finch station and the North York Centre station. You've got a Starbucks at Finch and a Second Cup at North York and nothing in between. This gap is being nicely filled with Asian owned indie places (Capriccio, L'Opera, Puff Cafe, Cafe Princess). Maybe a lil intimidating for whitey but suck in that man sack and try them. You'll be surprised."

I had a traumatic dental experience when I was a kid, so I was pretty hesitant on beginning regular dental care as an adult. I began going to this practice after receiving a postcard in the mail offering a new patient special. It could not be horrible, because I am still a patient here. 
I think things started out rough, with something you hear rumors about... a deep cleaning! I remember that experience and have not required another. I have had fillings, root canals, crowns, bridges, cleanings and teeth whitening procedures. I am happy that most of my procedures the past few years have been cleanings, but it sure took a lot of work to get to this point. 
I was a patient of Dr. Sani since day one, but I know see Dr. Zoumbaris, or Dr. Z as she is introduced. They are different styles, and it was tough letting a new doctor into my mess of a mouth. The other super great thing about this practice is you get to know the hygienists and technicians, as it appears they like the practice as well. 
Poor Dr. Z has to pick up my dental care as much of my dental work has aged. Rather than taking it easy, we are discussing some possible concerns and we are monitoring some teeth that have been thought to need some updates. 
I just want to say you should not fear the dentist! The team here is great and they lay out a treatment plan and help you stay on top of things. They remember you and can discuss things of relevance when you're in the chair. I can say I have not had any traumatic experiences at this dental practice, and do not foresee any occurring."

when i started this whole journey I scheduled three consultations for a Breast Revision with top doctors in the pittsburgh area. lets just say the plastic surgery industry can be extremely superficial. some drs and staff will often not listen to what YOU want, create unrealistic expectations and try to capitalize on insecurities, not at Beleza! 

after meeting dr whooten i knew immediately she was the perfect fit. she is extremely professional with a light sense of humor yet very matter of fact and always nonjudgmental. she has surrounded herself with amazing staff that go above and beyond for each client. in the weeks leading to the surgery they followed up on every detail making sure i was preparing for the operation and addressed my every concern. the procedure went very smooth, recovery as well. in the following days my husband and i received many calls from the nurse and dr wooten,""just checking in"" to make sure all was well.

i am so blessed to have found dr wooten and beleza plastic surgery. it has been an extremely wonderful experience through and through. my results are fantastic! i look amazing but more importantly, i feel amazing!

Only downsides were that the orange soda chose that moment to run out and sputter all over my husband's cup but hey, ___ happens! Tea was pretty strong - I did half and half regular and sweet tea, and that's usually plenty sweet for me. But this time I had to add 4 packets of sweet n low. Might have been old tea? The employee was making more as we were finishing up. To be fair, we were there at an ""off"" time - 3pm. Late for lunch and early for dinner. But it might be nice to change out the tea more often.

He then tuned it and made sure it was ready to play, all for a very reasonable price.

OWu_ftGoAIFjFENBsuFGpg,qWb-JvbJFC1XZ_FNRapM_A,"Having worked in the cosmetics industry for both L'Oreal & Revlon, facial care is heavily ingrained in my daily routine. Yes I'll admit, I am one of those people that invest heavily in food, travel, and beauty products. Yes, I slather an average of 8 products on my face daily and have tested my skin with everything from the floral lotion, to snail extract, or starfish products and get facials once a month. That said, this light therapy / laser experience was a new for me and their technology very much future forward. I got the SilkPeel dermal infusion treatment.  

The Process: 1.5 hr from beginning to end, started off with being immediately attended to at the reception area by the clinic manager where you fill out a profile and medical record, then a personalized consultation with a senior medical consultant, followed by a registered nurse conducting the dermal infusion on you, and the grand finale of the light therapy. The staff there are extremely polite, sweet, and professional, and made the experience very much enjoyable. The consultation encompassed walking you through the process as well as the technology behind it, risks that are plausible, and what to expect in results. A nurse practitioner would then guide you into a room and assess your personalized skin type. She was very attentive and detailed in terms of explaining their products as well as what works best for you, and selected the combination that fit best to your personal profile. I find facials at any location always caters their products to their clients, but this location in particular was much more patient in explaining the reasoning and product choice they thought would work best for you, which I loved. The procedure of dermal infusion, then light therapy followed. Finally you leave with a bright and volumized skin and a skin samples for post treatment use. 

Procedure: My regular facial treatments consist of exfoliation, cleansing, then product infusion. Dermalinfusion (their patented treatment) combined all three steps into one, saving time. They used a diamond tipped edge which they exfoliated your face. Admittedly I found this a bit rough as I have sensitive skin, and I noticed a very light scar post treatment along my nose bridge which I know will go away in three days time, but as much as I like diamonds, this exfoliation tip is probably not for me. The extraction vaccum that sucked away the dead skin was fine and felt like being continually getting small kisses. The serum infusion was pleasantly cool as it got layered onto my skin to take away the redness and was liquid and light and didn't feel like it was oily or weighing down my skin. There was no scent which is a plus as that's quite subjective at times. The light therapy, or laser treatment I noticed helped smooth out my uneven pigmentation and results were very apparent even though it's been one visit only. It was quite the light show and I personally found it a bit dizzy at times, but let's be real, lying there not doing anything, and yet get glowing results after 40 minutes of light exposure, pretty obvious decision that it's a Go. Their complimentary sample products included a specific lotion for post laser treatment that I am lathering on and has a soothing effect to combat the warm lingering sensation that's still on my face after 24 hours. Post treatment, I can see that my skin is visibly more bright and volumized, slightly smoother pigmentation, and less dry and creased in select areas.  

Location & Parking: Free and abundant parking available in clinic plaza. Easy to find. 

Overall: Would recommend the process, but limit frequency as facials like these are deeply penetrating and I can't see myself doing this biweekly. The interior is very clean, new, and makes you feel relaxed right away. Service is definitely a 5 star and hard to find such great consistency from all staff. Confirmation call would be best to confirm location as well as time and attendance as they have three different locations in GTA. Their website could be a bit more informative that focuses more on treatment remedies and types of treatment, and not just explaining patient needs, but worry not because in person they do a very detailed and great job walking you through. Two procedures in the time commitment of one facial. If only food and gym time worked the same way. Facials are amazing and my cells do all the heavy lifting. Give it a try, the results are worth it!"

The food was subpar.  I had a pasta dish - spaghetti with rosГ© sauce.  The sauce was okay, but it strangely had green onions scattered throughout.  My boyfriend tried it and agreed that it wasn't bad, just unexpected for the description (he's Francophone).  

The real issue came with the up-sell of garlic bread and cheese for the pasta.  I said yes to both, not realizing that the cheese would be an additional charge.  When the BF said ""really? It's more for both I think."" I cancelled the cheese but kept the garlic bread.  At no time did she offer to tell me what they might cost, nor did she really say they would cost more just ""Would you like to add extra cheese or garlic bread?""

My French isn't great but it's good enough to get me around a restaurant, and it's the first language of the BF so we would have caught it if she had said anything more.

He had an ""all dressed"" pizza (Americans - just pepperoni with veg) and could barely eat it since it was so dry and yet magically also greasy.  We had asked if it would be enough for two and the waitress said ""no"", but it would have been plenty.

The bill.  I mentioned the garlic bread.  Guess how much it was for 3 small pieces of very garlic-y, very greasy cheese topped bread?  Did you guess OVER SIX DOLLARS??  No, of course you didn't because that would be crazy.  The pasta was $12.  

So with our one pizza, one pasta, one garlic bread, one soft drink and one small beer after tax, but before tip, our lunch was $44.72.

Such a bummer."

It is a small establishment. The is maybe about 2 or 3 small tables and can probably seat around 6 people. However this place is more of a takeout place. I ordered their Chicken Biryani for takeout. It was delicious and good portion for $5.99 + tax. Came with sliced eggs on the bed of rice and small container of salad on the side."

YD8C2WoDt5WOIao-Em3hhw,U83F-SCFuqVKrG1uc6bUHw,I had a procedure done with my primary care to remove some cervical cancer cells. I went to PA to stay with my mom because I was afraid to be by myself. During my stay with her I got really dizzy and nauseous. I didnt want to go to the ER because my copay was so high and I didn't have the money at that time. I went to this urgent care because it was by my mom's house and at this point I just needed to feel better. Their bedside manner was good and they were very patient with me..I tend to whine about everything lol...but they made me feel better and he sent the nausea medicine to the pharmacy to save me a wait at the pharmacy since I didnt feel to good. I got what I needed and went on my way....I am very grateful that they took good care of me...the wait time was not too bad but it's something that is expected at an urgent care and the hospital would have took much longer like 3 times longer lol...great experience overall!

I'd normally be right there with you, but we grabbed lunch here today and it was delicious. Spicy tuna rolls ($5.95) were perfectly rolled, rice was perfectly seasoned, and it was all very fresh and tasty. Kiddo devoured an avocado-cucumber roll ($3.95)... she killed it so fast, we went back for seconds! The gentleman at the cash was just delightful, when he saw that we were back for more he threw in some complimentary edamame for kiddo and a ""sample bite"" of dynamite roll, which was just dynamite. They were out of spicy tuna on our second visit, but made up a new one for me fresh right away. I also got a lovely wakame salad - very fresh, very tasty, and a super reasonable $3.50. You can't beat this. Best cheap sushi I've had in a long time - far better than any of the crap sushi over on Bloor - and best grab and go sushi ever, with friendly, accommodating service to boot. I'm in love. Will be back even when I have no business in the hospital."

The salespeople asked if they could help us, and my friend said he was looking for a coat. They showed him a few things in the $400+ price range, and he said that his budget didn't allow for that. They then laughed in his face, and said ""Well then why don't you just go to Winner's? This is Queen West"". It beyond rude, it was beyond insulting. It was just plain disgusting. I wanted to grab all the clothes off the racks and throw them on the floor and kick the salespeople in the shins, but I didn't. My friend and I calmly exited the store, and we have never gone back.

Here we are now in 2014 and they've torn down the old, tiny Walmart building and erected a gigantor super Walmart just behind where the old one sat.  I'd like to dance and prance through fields of flowers and sing the praises of this new ""super"" Walmart, but I can't.  

Have you ever been to a ghost town?  Have you ever been to a ghost store?  *Cue the creepy music*

This super Walmart has all the usual stylings you find at most super Walmarts.  You know what else it has in common with other super Walmarts?  A skeleton crew.  

There are 4 cashiers,manning the 20 check out lanes, and two customer service peeps behind the counter.  All the other employees are stretched as thin as possible to cover the rest of the store.  I'm in sporting goods, I need a fishing license.  Nope.  You will have to walk all the way back to customer service and request help.  They will then call for help in the sporting goods section over the PA.  Next step:  enter the grumpy, overworked employee.  This is the standard MO for all departments.  If you can't help yourself, you will be going on a hunt for the elusive, poorly treated employee.   

This is not unusual for Wally world these days.  Many locations run on a skeleton crew, so the bazillionaire Waltons can save a buck."

The beautiful facilities, pleasantly warm pool temperature, and the guidance of several encouraging physical therapists gave my mother, a lifelong swimmer, a chance to enjoy a softened variation of her former workout. 
For her, this also became a comforting place to regularly relate to others with similar orthopedic issues. Comparing progress notes with fellow therapy patients and learning about their journeys was as valuable to my mother as the actual physical therapy.
She was able to experience the joy of water exercise in a safe, well-planned environment.
The open pool hours were very accommodating, the monthly fee reasonable, and the safe, well-managed facility were very attractive features of the post-physical therapy experience that is offered.
Though I am an athletic swimmer and not as much in need of physical therapy, I plan to maintain a monthly membership at Peter B. Lewis to ease my arthritic challenges. I am open to the possibility that I would engage in both the dry land and aquatic physical therapies that are offered here."

Formally known as Salute Lounge and then Zebra Lounge, its now known as The Label.  The Palazzo can name this spot anything they want, but no matter the name, they always have top-notch musical performers here.

When I was here, it was a duo with a pianist and a guitar player.  They covered pretty much all kinds of songs from Tina Turner, Michael Buble, Bruno Mars, and The Eagles.  I requested them to do ""Sir Duke"" by Stevie Wonder.  They couldn't pull it off, but as an alternative they did do a very good rendition of ""I Wish"".  That was awesome!

There is a two drink minimum here so if you do plan to stop by be prepared to order spend a little money.  It's really a small price to pay though for the free musical performances you're getting.  They do have some cool mocktails on the menu if you're not into booze and like the Laguna Champagne Bar they have a bar-bites menu provided by Zine Noodles & Dim Sum.

If you're looking for a nice chill spot in the Palazzo, and watch some really cool musical talent that you can watch for free, I highly recommend stopping by The Label."

I called him back and he came out a couple days later, and we found out that the mechanism in back was sticking and the spring was super stretched out, which he had not touched.  He fixed it and was super cool about it.  Machine works great now.  He also gave me a rough estimate as to what I could get for it if we sold it to get a new one.

The staff were very helpful when we approached them, but not all over us as we perused. Most of the major brands you would expect to find at a skateshop were there - and in Montreal that's saying something.

With only two cashes, however, we stood in line at least fifteen minutes before being able to pay for our purchases.

My main suggestion to the owners would be a little more sitting space - if you've come in off the street and have been shopping all day, sitting down is likely to extend my stay in your store and help you part me from the contents of my wallet."

Lacey and I recently worked together on a fashion editorial photo shoot. My three models had such different and unique looks. Once I showed Lacey my storyboard, she immediately got the vision, and knew what to do. We barely discussed the specifics, because I trust her. Her talent and experience brought to life three incredible looks that completed the vision I always had in mind. She can complete any look and puts people at ease. By the the time the models walked on set, they are energized and ready to work. She watches while I shoot, and steps in at just the right moments to fix something if it's out of place. I never felt like she was in the way. Details are everything in a stylized shoot, and she has the eye. Lacey is very fun to work with and kept everyone's energy up, especially on that long shoot day. I would recommend Lacey for any commercial work, bridal hair and makeup, or just if you're needing makeup for a girl's night out. She shows up on time, does exceptional work, and you will be left feeling beautiful and confident. I look forward to the next time I work with Lacey, a true professional."

If you order anything, I'd say try the seafood risotto. It actually wasn't bad. (Someone at another table ordered the pistachio crusted salmon and it looked good too.)

The other bummer about this place is that's it's small...if you're coming here for a jazz performance, make sure to arrive early to snag a table. Otherwise you may be relegated to the bar or to the lobby outside the bar (which is definitely not ideal lol)."

-JXNpzCQdjHJgdBWkNWyUw,GCDf7UWiDfyg2JenNuYgZQ,"Over the years, I have sent several friends and their kids to ABC Driving School. While much depends on the level of experience and the ability to pick things up quickly by the student (0 Experience and slow to learn usually means spending more time in the parking lot; and sometimes, extra lessons are needed before a student is deemed good to drive).

While the school tries to have the same instructor for both lessons, sometimes scheduling issues (or requests) prevent this. Also, my friends kids have said that some instructors are better than others (same thing can be said for people in general; you get along better with some people than with others). But, only 1 feels that they didn't get what they paid for (though they passed the road test and got their license without a problem + the Certificate of Participation than can save up to 60% on Car Insurance). While the other 6 really liked it.

Will they write an independent review? I don't know. But, I thought that I would give one.

However, if your kid (especially with experience) or you, feels that too much time was spent in the parking lot on the first lesson (expect 1 to 2 hours at least). Or, the instructor didn't do the job adequately, you need to make the school aware of this so they can work to resolve the issue.

It was school policy that regardless of the level of experience, the student is to start out behind the wheel, as the instructor has the auxiliary brake and accelerator. And, can easily drive/control the car from the passengers' side."

Smoker I has really cool employees that really knows how to make conversation with you and in case you're in a hurry with no time for talk, I'm sure they'll totally be cool with you just bailing in the middle of a conversation. I would like to emphasize that previous statement because all the smoke shops I've been too have grouchy employees that make me feel unsettled (like getting my age wrong when im being id'd and getting yelled at for being ""underage"" or getting shunned for buying a product at the age 18).

This place offers water pipes (or bongs), pipes of all smoking sorts, papers, tobacco, hookah, blades, and all the other smoke shop stuff at surprising prices. I was replacing my slider for my water pipe and was expexting it to be at least $7, but I got it for an even $5! Same exact thing happened to me with cartomizers. The shop doesnt have that distinct, smoke shop smell either. What it does have is this unique smell thats even better than a regular smoke shop.

Smoker I has a decent inventory from cheap, low quality to cheap; high quality things. This place sells a nice assortment of vapor accessories like battery chargers, clearomizers, and juices. They also have a nice assortment of glassware. The water pipes are nice and more unique, glass pipes are good looking, and the bubblers look great. Even if the shop has a smaller inventory than other smoke shops, I'm sure you'll be able to find something suited for you.

Smoker I is a really good place to buy your smoking products and a really nice place just to visit despite it seeming like another smoke shop on the side of the street. This is the closest smoke shop to me and the best one I have ever been to.

They told me they do not have the same frame and that I would need to purchase another frame where the frames would fit or another pair completely new. I was brushed off completely.
I was o upset. My husband suggested I call other locations to see if they had the same frame. I did that. You will never believe what I heard. The very nice lady I talked to was more than willing to help. She looked online and saw that many locations had the frame still, and guess what the Queensway location had many in stock. I thought to myself WOW.......
Employees that do not do absolutely nothing to keep customers or least try to resolve the issue. They just didnt care."
lmDmacUl81tfUUxPJZwz9A,YbHiEo85yHcChBvpG3GqJA,"I have never wrote a review on any business before but Barbra (owner of Annas pet grooming) deserves one! Let me start off by saying I have been going here for over 16 years, even before Barbra was the owner and the place was run by Anna, hence the name Annas pet grooming.
Anna sold her business to Barbra after 5 years of me going to this place and Barbra kept the stores name. Unfortunately my little dog who both Anna and Barbra groomed passed away and I had never heard from Barbra again, until i got a new little pup 8 years later! The first time I walk in to her shop after 8 years she instantly recognizes me and remembers my dog who had passed. That shows how much she cares about her customers! Anyways now on to the review..
She has excellent technique and can trim, cut and style your dog any way you like! She gave me at home grooming advice and tips to make mine and my pets life easier. I also take my very anxious dog here to get her nails trimmed every few months because the only person she trusts to do it is Barbra! I have nothing but good words to say about her! She is known by everyone in the community, we love her!"

Tory is awesome, and is always willing to sit and listen for as long as you need questions answered & is great at explaining what she thinks needs to happen. Also, the medical assistant has done a great job drawing labs each time, and has yet to not achieve getting all labs on the first attempt (which is pretty good for my veins). Truly happy with my care here, i have a pretty complex medical situation and I came to Tory after shuffling around from primary care docs, this clinic was a much needed breath of fresh air! Referrals get done on time, same day appointments, same day blood work & radiology (in office), it doesn't get better than this!"

That's fine I will do the McDonald's app from now on, since the price is the same regardless of the store. My burgers were cold, which wasn't surprising since they had the order done so fast. Poor quality food, poor customer service, and the not so busy store was dirty. Like the super sticky drink station. For a new location, they should be winning customers, not pushing them away.

HIl_HyZTwCFPq3pwaFwnAg,fu1b8n8D2ayq4fXVeuQSRA,"I was a renter with this company for two years. When I first moved in the place had not been cleaned. The company did send someone out to clean it before I moved in, but this cleaning person remarked over and over again that she could not believe that they would rent out this unit without cleaning it. I didn't really realize how dirty it was until a cleaning professional showed me.

At the end of my lease, I moved out with no deductions. In fact, the manager mentioned that he was thrilled with how well I had cleaned the property (obviously much cleaner than when I moved in). I got my security deposit back in less than 14 days, but I was sent a check for $900 dollars instead of the $1,100 as was stated on my lease. When I contacted the company, I was told that there was ""a mistake"" with my paperwork, and even though that was the amount that was listed on my lease, that was not correct because they had receipts for $900. They said that the only way that I could get the full deposit back was to show receipts from the money orders from when I originally moved in two years ago. Of course I do not have that because I thought that a lease was a binding contract. In their words, ""A lease is no proof of payment."" The lack of organization and professionalism with this business is unbelievable. While I was living in the unit, it took a year and a half to get a leak fixed, and now they are stating that they cannot abide by the lease."

DXlK5bBwXbPmEYQcHPZIJw,e7Wv4TZGj0rSa2ao-kyAvg,"My wife and I were looking for our first home. The Batchelor group was the first realtor we contacted. They seemed really nice and were eager to help us out. We went thru all the steps to start the process but when we got to the house searching part  all we got in our email was broken down shacks that were less than our price range and not what we were looking for. They would send us 4-5 emails with the same listing repeatedly only to fill our e mail space and waste our time. I brought it to their attention quite a few times and had to keep reminding them of what we were looking for. It's like they never paid attention to what it was we wanted in a house. It seemed as though they were trying to sells us what they wanted us to buy.  I reminded them again what we were looking for, but to no avail. We gave up on The Batchelor Group all together after 8 months. We talked to a different agent and they were finding better properties for us. Batchelor Group kept sending me e mails filling my e mail with unwanted properties again. I just ignored the emails for a while. My wife and I became extremely busy and put the house buying on hold for a while. Later we came across a house that was everything we wanted so I contacted the realtor and it happened to be Jillian with The Batchelor Group. I was a bit surprised, but my wife and I decided to give them another chance. We went thru all the steps and put down an offer to the seller. When my wife and I reviewed the paper work with our attorney, he noticed a lot of mistakes on the info and the numbers. I brought it to their attention and they said it was a computer problem. Why didn't they double check the contract before sending it out. This contract meant everything to my wife and I. It was very important to us so why didn't they take the same precaution to insure all the info was right? I had to point out over and over of mistakes that were still present in the contract. They were finally able to get it right after giving us one excuse after the other. We went on and had the house inspected after everything was rectified. At the inspection my wife and I came across a few thing that were supposed to be done before the inspection. We tried to call and e mail Jillian but we never got a return call or an e mail. The house inspector told us that the house wasn't safe and there was too many thing wrong with it. We cancelled the contract and needed to sign a document to cancel the purchase, but when they sent us the document it had all the wrong information on it. They blamed it on the computer again. We finally gave up on The Batchelor Group due to lack of customer service, Improper document handling, unprofessionalism and no attention to detail. This process of buying our first home was so important to us, but Jillian  and The Batchelor Group didn't think  so. It showed in the way they did business. They give themselves high scores for their selling techniques, but we disagree. They were not who they claimed to be. Be ware of this company and if you do decide to do business with them make sure you check everything they do to cover your end. We would never do business with them again. The signs were there from the beginning and we should have avoided them at that time, but we believe in giving  second chances. We now have our dream home and we learned a lot of what to avoid when we are buying a house. We are just passing our experience to others so that they will be aware of bad apples in the market."
HfK4q0wYVfAIDgI5QUNzYQ,0GUqJQe46Ci8rVzMD3X_gA,"I got a door ding on my passenger back door about a month ago and a competitor ""paintless"" dent repair company said they couldn't get it out because they couldn't reach it. I lived with a door ding on passenger side and it was pretty ugly to look at. Two weeks ago, someone's shopping cart hit my car in a parking lot and caused a lot of damage to my driver side back door! It was a bad dent and awkward looking. It wasn't a typical door ding, it was pretty big.  This really got frustrating having both sides of my car with a door ding and dent. 

I thought I would give Dent Solutions a try. I spoke with Sharlene on the phone and she said to bring it in so they can take a look to give me an estimate. Oscar took a look at it and was upfront and said it was going to be a difficult job. He said it's going to look about 90%-95% back to brand new looking.  I liked that he set the expectation up front. Oscar assured me that 90-95% to the guys in the shop, is closer to 100% for customers. He said that I would be happy with the results. He gave me a very reasonable price for the work. I was a little hesitant because of what he said about 90-95%, but decided to go ahead with the work.

After about 2 1/2 hours, they finished my car. First and foremost, even though he said it would look about 90-95% new, to me it looked 100% brand new. If you didn't know there was damage in that area, you would never know it got hit by a shopping cart. You really need to get a few inches away from the car to even notice any blemishes and there was hardly any at all. Standing a few feet away, it looks perfect and brand new again.

Secondly, Dent Solutions also was able to get the other ding out of my door that the competitor company said couldn't be done! That was an added bonus and was very happy with their work.

A huge shout out and thank you to Dent Solutions, Oscar, and especially Alex who did the work on my car. Alex is very talented at paintless dent repair! I hope not to get any more dents or dings, but if I do, I definitely will return to Dent Solutions. Great customer experience and customer service from Sharlene, Oscar, and Alex.

Thank you Dent Solutions!

This place has a great selection of dog/cat foods that are actually GOOD for your dog or cat!

They have a decent selection of toys, a lot of chews/bones (including the elk antlers that my ""tough chewer"" boxer loves so much), and they have treats from the manufacturers of the above mentioned GOOD for your dog, dog food companies.

I have to be careful to make this review about Burton's and NOT a soapbox rant about feeding better quality food, that said...

PROS: 
Great food selection;
Great treat selection;
Great chews/bones/toys selection;
Decent collar selection;
Some crates, bowls, training/cleanup aids, but not a ton of stuff in those departments;
Decent selection of grooming/health stuff.

CONS:
The staff is okay (not overly welcoming or warm, just ""what are you looking for?"");
Having a boxer, her belly is virtually hairless so I was looking for a suitable sweater for her and thought, for sure, that Burton's would have at least SOME functional/reasonable coats and sweaters, but no such luck at all!  :(
The items are pricey--not by Burton's mark-up, but because the (food) items ARE pricey from the manufacturer for their significantly better ingredients.

Sure you can go to Wally World and get a $15/50# bag of dog food, but its crap for your dog to eat."

There's ample parking and generally the area is quite busy.  They used to make great pizzas with lots of cheese and toppings but it seems like they're starting to skim a little bit.

The owner also owns a franchise at Bayview and Major Mac, but the fact that I'm getting pizza that doesn't have as much cheese, kind of defeats the purpose of a pizza. Now, I definitely don't blame the staff, because I'm assuming the owner wants to use less cheese and toppings to keep costs down. But considering other chain pizza's are using proper amounts of cheese... I feel like unless you have no other options around you, then go to Pizza Pizza, but Little Caesars has great deals, Dominos has amazing deals as well and their pizza is perfect!

I worked at the Eldorado Casino back in the mid 90's and this place use to have decent food......that was back when it was named ""Cactus Joe's"".  It's really gone downhill since those days.

I happened to be in the area and stopped by for lunch with my Mom.  I ordered the Nachos w/o Meat and Mom ordered the Fish & Chips special.

After a short wait we were served our food.  I was disappointed to see that the Nachos were Chips, Cheese Whiz, Tomatoes, Onions on a plate with a small bowl of Beans, cup of Guacamole, cup of Salsa, and two packages of Sour Cream on the side......what the ___?  Was I suppose to create this thing myself?  Where did it say that on the menu?  I know why they did it.....to save money.  There's less food waste when you do stuff like that, but seriously?

As a fan of Nachos it was a huge letdown.....plus they didn't taste good at all.  The Chips weren't fresh and the flavors were just strange.....unappealing.

Mom enjoyed her Fish & Chips, which were really Fish & Fries.  She liked her Fish and I tried a few Fries...they weren't bad.  Maybe I ordered the wrong item?

Overall, the service was good and since Mom enjoyed her dish I'm giving this place 2 Stars instead of 1.

Eoi2ANBg9Ut7xaKxSmZ7xQ,X_Ae0Azn6CmWWDtm5zXwGQ,"Wow... did I go to a different place? This is legit bad. What a joke. 

First off this place is at a condo and so parking is a bit weird cuz the parking is supposed to be for the condo visitors. 
Anyways, this place literally has only a dozen seats. U order the food and find your own seat. 

We ordered a combo which include a bowl of noodles, egg drop sweet soup and a piece of sticky rice pizza. The combo was extra two bucks because we wanted the intestine noodles, making it 12.99. And we also ordered a chicken cartilage wide vermicelli for 10.99. I also checked into yelp to get a three piece shumei for free. Total it was $27. 

All the food came in disposable plastic take out containers. Nothing like the pictures. But that's not a dealbreaker, let's talk about the food itself!

1. Chicken cartilage wide vermicelli. Some chicken cartilage are cold. They didn't microwave it long enough. Yes looks like they don't have a proper kitchen it's just microwaving. We heard the beep. And you can feel the tiny grainy bone next to the cartilage. And the wide vermicelli is essentially Ho fun ??. It was all mushy not appetizing at all. Take a look at a video I took. The taste itself meh, oily and loaded with the sesame paste with bits of preserved veggies that add a crunch. If u have microwaved leftover ho fun, this is exactly it. 
2. Intestine noodles. I didn't eat the intestine but bf said it's not smelly. I tried the noodles. It's better(?) than the ho fun but it's also very greasy loaded with sesame paste, gunk sitting at the bottom, making it taste even a bit bitter....
3. Sticky rice pizza is essentially a piece of ??? (the glutinous rice with chicken wrapped in leaf dim sum) cut into a square. 
4. Wuhan shumei. Maybe I have never tried it wuhan style but the texture is truly off. It is so soft it's like dripping! It's essentially the same glutinous rice in a different format.
5. Egg drop rice sweet soup. In the fridge... cuz we were so stuffed from the greasy pasty noodles. 

I mean.... it's TWENTY FRICKING SEVEN DOLLARS! For this price you are definitely better off eating at Sansotei for a jap ramen, MeiNung for a flavorful beef noodle soup, Wonton Hut for beef brisket wonton noodles or any hk style chachantang for a porkchop vermicelli. This is such a joke. Such a bad joke. 

I decided to try it out as I saw that there are a few locations in Toronto already, thinking that it should be ok. But this is far from OK. Maybe other locations that have a legit kitchen would be better but I wouldn't wanna try. 

Half a star for the cashier who was nice and explained the menu to me. Otherwise this would be a negative. 
And we later found that the guy who occupied the most comfortable sofa seat by himself should be the owner/manager....(?) idk. Shouldn't the more comfortable seats be reserved for customers?

Don't go. You have been been warned."

7wveL2PVM-qFxNhRsVJF1Q,O1nHQ_Q5KXqY9p4WziNlAg,"Took my car to Dent Masters after another car door slammed into my car door leaving two dents and broken paint.

I was given a verbal quote that seemed really good so I took a chance without shopping around. 

Because of the broken paint, I was told that the door had to be repainted and that it would take two trips to get it finished: one for paint, and one for color sand and buffer.

The dent was removed perfectly but the paint was far from perfect. After the color sand and buffer, the paint did not look anything like I was led to believe it would look like.

I brought the car in two more times after the color sand and buffer to get it right, and even though it looked good after picking it up, the paint would look bad again after a couple hours of being parked.

I took my car in today to a big name shop and was told that there is no clear coat on the door and now it needs to be repainted again. I'm now stuck with a rental car and paying another business to get it right the first time.

Steve(whom I presumed to be the owner), seems like a really professional guy and tried to make it right, but I just couldn't handle taking my car in there again not knowing if it was going to come out right."

I haven't had one of these in awhile (not since I lived down the street from the Clark location), and I'm hyped up for it. 

As for the store, it's not huge. It sits in the plaza next to Shopper's World (which took up the old Tops/Finast, and more than likely inhabits the leftover space from that business). It is however (so far for now), very clean and well organized. The shelves seem to be well stocked with the usual fare, and employees with the average middle wage attitude that accompanies working within a grocery store. They have the basic staples and necessities for great prices; but if you need something more exotic, then you're better off heading down the road a ways to the local Giant Eagle.

If you've ever been inside such a store, than you should already know what to expect from your future shopping endeavors."

The roti hut is not anything fancy for the decor, but they have a killer Roti, the Roti originated in Trinidad and is a popular dish in the Caribbean, a wrap consisting of an unleavened stoneground whole meal flour, filled with curried goat, or chicken or beef. My favorite is the goat, with chicken a close second. This is a hidden gem for me, I visit once a month for my Spicy Roti Fix, I love supporting small independent places where they take pride in their food and concepts, the menu all looks good but I have only had the rotis and the jerk chicken, both amazing, if you like curry, spice and goat, give this place a try!"

They have a somewhat limited menu but their focus, which seems to be on Maki rolls is really good and in some cases, inventive. We sampled a variety of Maki rolls including the spider roll, the dynamite roll, the las vegas roll...all of them were excellent with fresh flavours and good textures and contrasts. Friendly service too.

ZRy8dkrWDRxg35Hk1gJowQ,pahPapfEGA9D1NFOevZZOQ,"Recent retirees from Washington state (rainy side) so we don't know many local contractors nor much about awnings. Mike spent about 45 minutes with me doing the original estimate. Answered all my questions thoroughly and provided good suggestions for our situation. We have a golf course view and were a little concerned about the awning blocking view when extended. He was able to represent the eye level and shadow line the awning would provide which helped with our decision.
   We had a tentative schedule for approx. six weeks out (awning needed to be made to order) and had a little communication hiccup when we hadn't heard anything at seven weeks. Mike responded appropriately right away, and gave us a firm installation date which worked for us. 
   On install, showed up on time. Very polite and professional and came up with a clean installation we just love. He asked questions during the install (height of mounting brackets, height of front bar with awning extended, etc.) to make sure we would b happy with the final result. We asked for some adjustments in level (our patio slopes slightly but the view fence is level so the reference to level was important to my wife and I who are particular about such things. Mike made all these adjustments cheerfully and it was clear he wanted us to be happy with the product. He assured us if we needed further adjustments he would be out promptly to make them without charge. He fully explained how to take care of the awning (almost maintenance free), wind load issues and reassured me BBQ smoke would not be an issue in our situation.
   Price was exactly as quoted and work was top notch. Square D was at the upper end of price in the research we did, but quality ratings were very high and I believe we absolutely got what we paid for. Ours was a particularly long and heavy awning and I think the house will come down before the awning does. Did a great job and would highly recommend Mike and Square D Awnings"

He arrived early, stayed late and even stayed through our portrait session just to get some extra footage for our video, at no extra charge. One thing that I really appreciated was his input on photo ideas and his ability to work so well with our photographers. Some of the shots he set up for our photographer are my favorites from the day.

I had a catfish with two sides plate and ordered some corn fritters to share with my dining partner. Trying to keep it southern style I went for greens and baked beans for my sides. The corn fritters came and it was a pretty decent basket full. I did not finish them or even try to before my entree came. 

My entree had three pieces of catfish that were golden brown, juicy and had a very tasty crust. Under the tasty crust was light and flaky catfish, with just the right amount of moisture. The portions of catfish were pretty big as well. By the time it was over I was thinking two pieces of catfish would have been enough! The crust stood out because it sort of lingered in my mouth. Unlike many crusts, this one acted like it's own element, not just a covering. For lack of a better description, it was like a tasty skin.

The greens tasted home made. Reminded me of the kind my grandmother or aunt would have brought to Thanksgiving dinner and the beans were pretty good as well. The fish came with a couple of dipping sauces, but I didn't need them. They also had regular name brand condiments on the table. 

All in all I will return here if I am on or near the strip because of another MAJOR asset of the restaurant! There is cheap parking right next door! Try that on the strip. Since I was in a rental, parking was a very cool thing. Unfortunately the CES was during the week so I missed the entertainment in the goofy little Hawaiian themed shopping center as well as the upcoming book and picture signing that was going to be held on the weekend. 

All and all a great deal on good food on the Strip!"
95GOG-c2BVdNNdMqUw8iWg,Vw6Fml-x0fz8oXWHTcfc_w,"Took my daughter here to get her blood drawn for allergy testing. Boy was that a mistake. Not gonna complain about how my daughter hated the situation. Because she's 2 months old and I wouldn't expect a baby to enjoy having her ankle bent in half to have blood drawn from her heel. Anyway, we chose to go with this place because our pediatrician advised of this place since there is so many locations and easy to get in and out. So, we go through the whole situation and during the blood drawing the lady says, ""just gonna get a little more blood to make sure there is enough for testing"". Also, we were told by the lab tech that we would have results within 48 hours. I think great! That's a quick turn around and they listened to the poor reviews about not getting enough blood. Well it's 10 days later and now we are called by someone who I can barely understand but guess what?!?! They did not get enough blood and we have to bring our daughter back in for more blood drawn. Looks like this company does not care about what there clients say. They do not listen to complaints and obviously do not care about the experience. If you can avoid using this company I advice on it."

When our offer was accepted, they called us to congratulate us and worked with us on everything that was necessary going forward. Their assistants are amazing and will help you with absolutely everything possible. After our house closed, their assistant gave me the code to the lockbox to get my keys because James and Jillian were on a family vacation for the winter holidays and I could not get the lockbox open. My husband tried and I tried again the following morning (multiple times), so I called her back and she came over and tried and managed to open the box (this was a Saturday morning) and gave me a big hug and congratulated me!

cdm9TISDvuR94dMwm07EQw,yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw,"I have spent too much time here in the last two weeks.

I went for a check up two weeks ago and was told I needed fillings done on both sides of my mouth. Since my mom is the one who pays for insurance, and anything that the insurance does not cover, I politely asked the assistants to tell her what was going on so she could be aware of the decision - she was having her teeth done as well. Not only did they tell her that I said I wanted half of the fillings done the same day - which I never said - they came back and led me to believe that SHE said she wanted them done today! 
This was all after her and I had both sat in the chairs waiting to be serviced. Apparently, there is only one dentist and the ladies at the front desk will take anyone who walks in, despite the fact that there are some people who have appointments and are waiting to be worked on.
Out appointment was at 11 and we did not leave until 3pm after I finally had my fillings done and had a cleaning and polishing on my teeth. The dentist was very callous and even when he tried to talk to me he 1) did it while his hands were in my mouth and I could not respond and 2) sounded bored and uninterested.
I eventually had to come back a second time to have the rest of my teeth done and he was exactly the same as before. And - the second time - after my mouth had stopped being numb I noticed that my tooth felt chipped or broken. So I rushed back to have him look at it just for him to tell me that he had ""put a filling there"". Well obviously! He ended up filing down the surface so it was even, but I did not appreciate being talked to like a child. 

If it wasn't for the fact that I had to have the other side of my mouth done and the receptionist offered me a discount because of the terrible service the first time I would not have been back! I was looking into having ortho work done here as well but I will never step foot into this establishment again."

QpBTAeC4zJzxyUbNwBuoVA,VnKj044Tt5doqaVDIJbWsw,"Bad Groupon Experience.

Long Story Short:
1) I bought a Groupon for a 55 minute Shiatsu massage here.
2) The appointment was hard to schedule.
3) The clinician, Denis, was 30 minutes late, and I only got a 20 minute massage.
4) When I pointed out that 20 minutes is not 55 minutes, he told me ""that's fine, it was a good deal."" ?!?!  

And now the long story...

First, they are incredibly difficult to contact.  They will never answer the phone.  It always goes to voicemail.  You'll play phone tag multiple times, you'll be asked to call other people, to text back and forth, etc.   After probably 9 or 10 communications, I finally got an appointment to use my Groupon...great.

Well, the clinician, Denis, was 30 minutes LATE for my 55 minute appointment...he cited transit difficulties.  He proceeded to tell me that he couldn't finish the whole treatment because he had another appointment booked.  So, I got 20 minutes of my 55 minute massage.  Plus, it's incredibly rude that I spent 30 minutes waiting...that alone is bad form.  

The conversations went off the rails at this point.  He said it was fair that I had gotten less than half of the Groupon voucher as ""I had gotten a good deal.""  It got super awkward after that.  I tried to explain that they set the prices of these vouchers, and that the discount is a way to get new clients. He offered to complete the other half of my massage sometime in the future after more awkward discussion.  I, however, have received no response whatsoever from follow-up attempts.

I also want to say that the clinic is anything but relaxing.  It's a bit noisy, not terribly clean, and very clinical.  It's also super cramped.  

The only reason they get 2 stars instead of 1 was that the massage therapist was actually rather talented.  It's too bad this clinic decided to scam me...otherwise, they would have had a new regular client.

Just an update for any of you who have also been scammed here.  Groupon had great customer service and gave me a credit for the full amount I paid!  They never heard back from them either lol."

So if you're craving ice cream after the bars close at 2 AM, then this is the place to hit up.  In fact, I kind of wonder if most of their business takes place in the wee hours of the morning.

The one primary characteristic of their offerings is that it's expensive...more than Loblaw's, more than Rabba, more than Metro, more than Sobey's.  The other suggestion is to avoid the produce...it's both rather gross looking and expensive.

In short, this is your drunk 2 AM kind of supermarket."

Best part about this gym is the low foot traffic. You'll almost always be able to do the exercise you want without waiting for equipment to free up. 

I was a member for 4 years and had no problem at all during my time here. 

When it was time to cancel, it became a big ordeal. My first cancellation request was approved but I was told I have to wait another month for the cancellation to go through. I think this is reasonable and not a big deal. But when one month has passed, they charge me for another month. I go back in to talk to the gym manager, he was nice and apologized for the inconvenience, said he'll refund me and make sure it doesn't happen again. 

The refund did not happen so after 15 business days, I put through a request on my credit card company to deny all future payments to this vendor and requested a refund for my one month surcharge.

u3WKEGTyfRgxx-PDotWmaQ,h8riySShDD_qy_3yfieHeQ,"Poor, poor, Pollo Sabroso.  They have the unfortunate distinction of being in the exact same niche as the incomparable, untouchable ""El Pollo Supremo"" on University in Tempe, which means they are going to be directly compared to the godfathers of mesquite mexican cookery, and Sabroso is bound to end up in 2nd place.

But, that said, this place is good.  Quite good, as a matter of fact, and I would have no problem stopping in with my family for meals in the future, even though El Pollo Supremo is just a few miles farther.  I definitely think there is enough to distinguish Sabroso from its competitors to make it a unique experience.

Chicken portions are good sized and fairly apportioned (you don't get stuck with just a neck and a wing in a 2-piece meal), and very well cooked, but much more subject to gristly weirdness than Supremo.  The seasoning and style is somewhat different, too, and while I prefer Supremo's drier red-smoke flavor, I could certainly respect other's opinions that prefer the warm, moist and mild flavors of Sabroso.  Supremo is a dry but superb assault on the senses with smoke and sodium, Sabroso seems to aim for tender and moist succulence.  

I think I dined here many years ago when it was under different ownership and the menu was all over the place, and the chicken back then was poor to fair.  Now, perhaps taking a hint from Supremo, Sabroso has signifcantly cut its menu down to the essentials (think whole chicken, 1/2 chicken, quarter chicken, and the essential sides and a couple quirky add ons) and that kind of laser-focus hopefully will keep them in business a long time as they perfect their chicken, and the Sabroso folks REALLY have improved the quality of the chicken compared to the last guys (Correatado?).  

Sabroso does have some tasty sides, and a good number of them, and their salsa is quite special, although not quite as good as Supremo's cold-pureed salsa.  I especially like the smoked jalapeno, and I wasn't sure what to make of it at first, but when I was done I considered it to be an integral and awesome component of the plate.  Good stuff!  The beans and rice are on par with the best of any authentic mexican eatery.

I do think the folks at Sabroso are a bit more service oriented than at Supremo, so for the uninitiated, the overall dining experience may be better at Sabroso.  The guys at Sabroso actually seem to like to talk about their food and their concept, while the masters slaving over the red coals at Supremo seem WAYYYYY too busy and removed to deal with the little people.  Hey, artists at work, do not disturb!  The staff is friendly and informative at both places, but Supremo has more of a feel of a roach coach that just happens to be inside of a building, while Sabroso embraces the general restaurant and service concept better.  

So, in the ultimate final summary of the Sabroso / Supremo Smackdown:

CHICKEN:  Supremo ***** Sabroso ***1/2
SIDE QUALITY:  Supremo ****1/2 Sabroso ****
SIDE CREATIVITY:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****
SIDE PORTIONS:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****
LOCATION:  Supremo *** Sabroso *1/2
DESIGN/ATMOSPHERE:  Supremo ** Sabroso **1/2
SERVICE:  Supremo *** Sabroso ****

FINAL SCORE:  Its all about the chicken at these dives!  SUPREMO *****, SABROSO ****

But Sabroso is certainly highly recommended.  Skip your next night at Carlos O'Briens, Carolinas or Miguels and try something really special!  Bon appetit!"

My home did receive a full priced offer quickly but I was told by my realtor that the property did not appraise do to a short sale being on my street. I was so stressed out due to my previous experience with another realtor that I accepted this. I wish my realtor would have done more to insure that my home appraised since at the time I was struggling financially and needed the money from the sale of my home.
IY6rPe-CAd7n-JXLPHhM3A,1aDE-Xns1vqHgQsegbQlcQ,"A fantastic dojo run by two of the most talented practitioners of Kokikai Aikido in the world. Kokikai Aikido was founded by Shuji Maruyama Sensei in the 1980s. He was a student of both Ki Society founder Koichi Tohei Sensei and the creator of aikido itself, Morihei Ueshiba Sensei. Maruyama Sensei, however, has developed an incredibly subtle and powerful variety of aikido that surpasses anything else I've experienced in the martial arts world, much less the aikido world. Nachman Sensei and Burrows Sensei have been students of Maruyama Sensei for decades, and their dojo in Tempe is one of the nuclei of Kokikai practice in the United States. You will not regret joining their ranks. Train hard, be patient with yourself, and enjoy not only the power of aikido but the joy of engaging in a safe, non-competitive martial art in a world that seems overly impressed with MMA and jujitsu."

Everything here is sparkling clean and orderly. Even with tubs of chocolates, rice, flour, spices, nuts, etc. the floor and surface areas are in excellent order. Prices are good.

Even McDonald's, with it's lethal addictive cocktail of salt and grease, cannot draw in people who will gladly wait in line (both inside and at the drive thrus) a ridiculously long time.

huCf4kwsoGl1YUHCjMJG5A,y7tQIpM_f-M69i6Vij8wzQ,"I've been a frequent traveler in and out of Billy Bishop Toronto City Center Airport for some time, but this was my first time renting a car from there. It was quite expensive, but I thought it would be convenient to rent from Hertz which is right on the island given the winter weather. The desk was right near the exit from baggage claim, and given it was late at night, there was no line. Unfortunately the customer service person seemed more interested in reading her book than helping me right away, and never acknowledged my long history of Gold Status with Hertz, but we quickly got my details taken care of. She then showed me to the rather unprofessional-looking door and hallway to the parking lot to collect my car, which doubles as the designated smoking area for airport and airline employees (not a very pleasant experience). The car itself was a nice upgrade from what I was expecting (I requested a sub-compact and received a small import SUV). In looking around the lot, it seems as though slightly more upscale vehicles were the general selection, as perhaps most travelers prefer nicer cars. However, a consideration for others from this ""upgrade"" might be potentially reduced gas mileage, and whether it meets your needs for other passengers.
Because of the newly-built pedestrian tunnel, I had to sit and wait for the ferry, which doesn't seem to run quite as frequently as before when it was the only pedestrian option. It was fairly straightforward, but those who aren't familiar with ferry loading and unloading processes might be slightly uncomfortable as the ferry operators were very basic in their directions. Plus, for those in a rush for a flight when returning a car, extra time and patience is needed.
The car itself was very good - clean and low mileage - and I didn't experience any problems. Returning the car to the same location, however, was a bit of a challenge. I arrived outside of normal business hours (apparently before 9:30am on a Sunday isn't busy enough to employ people), and was instructed to drop off the car using Express Return service. Well, approaching the ferry there was no attendant on duty, so I was forced to pay the $11 ferry charge at the pay box, which was not explained on the website or by the customer service person when picking up the car. Considering there is an $11 charge already included in the rental fees, I feel as though this fee is firstly unfair, but should also at least be clearly articulated. Then when approaching the gated lot on the island, my only option was to insert a pre-authorization card into a machine slot, or call for help. Not knowing what the first option even referred to, I called, and when the person eventually answered, was puzzled by the request but eventually let me in. Again, in the end not that big of an issue, but this was not at all explained by Hertz at any point. I wrote down the mileage and gas tank level, and dropped my keys off in the Express Return box after asking the three employees who were smoking to kindly move out of the way, and that concluded my experience with Hertz.
In summary, a few things to consider:
1) The convenience and car selection are good, but...
2) It is more expensive than other locations in the area. Convenience may trump cost, but on that note...
2) With the pedestrian tunnel, the convenience of picking up your car on the island may not be much of a time-saver, especially since...
3) There may be an additional $11 ferry fee to return the car, which just exemplifies that...
4) There is a general lack of communication by Hertz and its employees as to the process and potential fees for this location - or more just a lack of caring, in general.
In the end, I probably won't rent from this Hertz location again, and don't recommend it to others unless you have a lot of time, patience and money."
zVSGMN20-0sNL2dQss2pZw,hg7NGrA_VN-HnOR5HLYMJg,"I have a washer/dryer at home, but like other people I use laundromats for large items such as comforters and lots of towels after a big house cleaning session. Queen's Way has plenty of large capacity washers and is rarely packed with people (at least when I go, which is weekends in the middle of the day) so I can always find at least 1 or 2 of the big guys to handle my large loads.

I've never had any problems with the washers or dryers, although I have witnessed one incident where a machine was not filling for a customer.

In all my years in the financial industry, take my word on this: When times are tough, come to this check city. It's only one I will do business with and it's the only place I trust.

I ordered the Montreal smoked meat for $10. It came with nothing else but the sandwich (can anyone answer why local foods are more expensive...?). I thought this was pretty pricey considering I could get a combo for the same price anywhere else. 

However, Chachi's truly delivers on freshness and flavor. The meat was seasoned perfectly and moist. They added the perfect amount of yellow mustard and the ciabatta bun, unlike the cardboard monstrosities offered at Timmie's, was pillowy and soft. However I was still hungry after eating the entire sandwich. 

I've had their Kale salad before and it was lackluster for the high price they charged. The veg was fresh but it wasn't mind blowing. 

I would totally get Chachi's again but considering the  price and smaller portion, it would only be as a treat."

I still didn't want to get set up with a membership, and this time around the associate did not pressure me into signing up.  THANK YOU.  The bed was intense!  It was equipped with shoulder lamps, climate control, and lamp intensity choices.

I can handle a bad experience or two but not a group that routinely sets themselves apart in terms of sheer and utter failure to get anything right. Whether it be repairs, following through on agreement, or billing, you can count on these people to get it wrong every time AND follow it up with a good dose of indifference to anything relating to their client's needs (from a renters perspective). 

Clearly a team that relies utterly on a strong Calgary economy to keep vacancies low and renters in their places.

They had North American Van lines pickup my Dad's things and refused to load a table that he had hired them to move in the first place. Then they lied and said that the friend he had coordinating things told them not to take it. They said they could only go by what the three driver's had said. Which was a lie to CYA. They refused to bring it. The movers complained that the table was heavy and would not load it. They had three guys. My father had moved it himself before. Then the guy who delivered his things said the table could have been easily loaded. They sent one truck to get my father's things and moved it into a bigger truck at another location. They refuse to budge on the issue. Going in so many circles and passing the buck. He called the company to call the delivers to get them to load. They waited too long and it was too late. He would usually always get a voicemail and they don't call back. The only time you get calls back is before you pay. 
Buyer beware. If you Already hired. Don't pay full amount until they make things right.

This might be our last chance, we are early 70's and I have been having problems performing for a few years.  My first needles just didn't do the trick.  So I came in and had a stronger does made.  These felt like fire in my dick.  So back in for another change, also fire.  They removed some medicine and added another, great no more pain - but- still no results.  So back for another stronger dose.  I've had 25 - 30 shots with only one allowing me to have intercourse.

I'm told they don't give refunds, it is in the contract and when on our first visit neither my wife or I noticed (no one told us)  So please beware.  This could be the greatest medicine for you and, I hope it works well, or in my case a waste of money.  Try to get a trial period (three to five months) and only pay for this before you commit to the full price.  I wish I had.

Anna personally told me she was not happy with the quality of the manicure and would give me this set free.  This would have been fine if I had just been told beforehand or offered a cheaper rate for someone in training. But then she said I would have to pay $35 to fix them next time I came in, which she said I would have to  do the following week. I definitely didn't.

My family doctor was aware of this practice, and said she sent other patients here - I'm unsure & frustrated with the fact it was never raised when I was asking her about marijuana to benefit my quality of life, even though I had a synthetic cannabinoid prescribed by a former family doctor in Niagara years ago - it just goes to show that people need to take charge of their own health and do their best to maximize their quality of life by seeking multiple opinions in accessing as many experts as possible, and using it all to thoughtfully choose what's best for themselves."
JHH5RLKHDb8DxVbAadF6DQ,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,"A Public Fit Theatre Company is one of a couple of companies in Las Vegas that can be counted on to offer plays that have not been seen in Las Vegas before or are rarely offered.  You won't see Hamlet or Fiddler or something like that here.  What you will see is wonderfully acted, thought invoking dramas.

I saw my first play here in 2015 and I have seen three others since.  Everyone of them has been top notch.  After every play, the have a 10 minute break and then they have an optional talk back session they call The Buzz.  It gives you the chance to interact with the cast, to learn more about how things were directed, or other things about the show.  I always stay for this most interesting 15 minute Buzz.

Last night, I saw ""The Beauty Queen of Leenane.""  It's a play set in Ireland written by an Irish playwright and it is very, very well done!  The company also has bi-monthly or so readings of scripts.  Check their website for shows and other offering and to buy tickets.

The first time you go, you may have some difficulty finding the entrance to the theatre.  It's in a small ""alleyway"" behind PublicUS.  Look at the map with my photos and it will show you where you enter.

Now, turn off your cell phones, sit back, and relax and be prepared to be blown away by a great theatre company!

Note:  Not all plays are performed here at what the company calls The Usual Place.  One of the upcoming shows will be at CSN so check when you purchase."
HX63oml64Cxd_mraYT699g,PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,"I strung together three trails today for a 20 mile bike ride.  I liked the Cactus Wren Trail because it's nicely landscaped and it's a relatively new trail that follows the Pittman Pecos Wash.

I'd give this trail more than 3 stars but the trails are not marked.  If it hadn't been for Google Maps, I wouldn't know this existed.  You look on the City of Henderson's website and find the trails and they'll have a map.  That doesn't help too much when you're riding and there are no signs.

I rode the trail until it ends just before Eastern.  However, it doesn't end there.  You're supposed to head east and the trail goes through the Cactus Wren Park where you take the bridge to get to the St. Rose Parkway Trail.  Lacking any signs, I did a bit of a search through the neighborhood before returning to the trail I took at the beginning rather than the real trail.

To the City of Henderson--your trails are great.  You need better signage in this area, more like the Anthem East Trail area."

Normally, I would not have ventured into this type of store (without my grandma) but my friends were looking to buy new shoes for work. 

They have analysis software for your feet which helps to identify where the most pressure is in your step. Then they recommend ""orthotic"" insoles to help correct the deficiencies. I have been walking on air for the last 3 weeks since I got the insoles for my work shoes. 

Anyone in the healthcare field should come in for a visit and get their feet analyzed. My friend got a 15% off discount for working for St. Rose Hospitals.

I've been to Big Al's Comedy Club several times.  Like any other comedy club, how good it is depends who's booked for that week.  I've seen as bad as Kato Kaelin and I've seen some good comics.

The venue is odd because it once was a restaurant in the Orleans.  The entrance is almost directy across from the buffet entrance.  There are two rows of plush seats in the front.  These are people who are being comped or have gotten their early to try to get seats close to the front.  On the left side facing the stage, there are some booths that also have some chairs, but the largest section--the middle--is made up of longer tables with seating on both sides and that hold 8 people.

The club is open Wednesday through Sunday and there is one show at 8 PM.  Cost is $19.95 which includes tax and one drink.  

Last night, I saw Kristeen Von Hagen and Danny Villalpando.  Both were funny, but with only two comics other than the MC who only does a brief stint, both featured comics seemed long.

It is an OK venue and depending on the people booked, it's a good club to attend."

ecu6vyDE-ninSu3zp0kuhA,C37CnhZ4hrpHT1PIHIbA-w,"I cannot begin to express my disappointment and anger at how my family was treated by the  staff of Hudec Dental Lakewood. I came in this morning as a first time patient. My appointment was at 11:20. After I signed in, a man came in who was 50 minutes late for his appointment. They agreed to see him before me, causing me to be seen 30 minutes late. This would not be that big of a deal had my wife not come in a few hours later for her 2:00 appointment, only to be refused service because she was 7 minutes late. 

Getting back to my appointment. Your dental hygienist was the rudest, most uncaring person I have ever met and should not be working with patients. I am not naive, I understand that that there will be  a certain level of pain and discomfort, but there is also an expectation that the hygienist will have even the slightest bit of compassion and empathy. She was rude and annoyed at my pain. She nicked my gums dozens of times and never once asked me how I was doing. Never once apologized or displayed a modicum of compassion. In fact the only time she stopped to give my aching jaw and bleeding gums a break was to chastise me for reacting to the pain by moving my head too much. And even that was presented to me in a demeaning and rude manner. 

I know from other conversations I overheard while there that she was annoyed that the usual receptionist was out of the office and she kept having to help the temp with computer and systems issues, but that is no excuse to take it out on a customer. However, if she was taking it out on me, that would far more forgivable than if she was just terrible at working with patients, which she was. This was a terrible first impression and I can't foresee myself or my family returning to this practice. Very disturbing."

Fu0YD6AsGEyIgwsgtiin-A,Qx1A9oiFBLVcdffOKC7xCA,"First off, I would like to say that I have been meaning to write this review for some time now as my experience occurred a few weeks ago. I do apologize for not warning people about this place sooner..

My girlfriend and I ordered two sandwiches, two bags of chips, and two drinks from Firehouse subs online through the Grub hub app..After receiving our food, the first thing we realized was that our chips were wrong and two random bags of chips were in place of what we had ordered and that was just the beginning. (I have never been one of those customers who nit picks everything.) I said oh well and moved on..) Now on my sandwich I asked only 5 ingredients .. ham, cheese, lettuce, mayo, and mustard.. when I pulled it apart..my sandwich consisted of only ham, lettuce, and mayo..no cheese and no mustard..my girlfriends sandwich also had no cheese. At this point, still remaining calm, I called Firehouse subs myself to kindly explain that our order was not corrct..and hoping we would be able to get the correct sandwich's or something along those lines...this phone call to Firehouse subs is the main reason that I felt not only just angry but also extremely upset, disgusted by the way I was treated, and overall just completely disappointed with the service I received from this restaurant...

When calling Firehouse Subs, a woman answered and immediately asked if I could hold. While on hold I could clearly hear the woman who answered the phone apologizing to another customer about getting that customers order wrong and telling her she will give her a refund for all of the mistakes they had made! That was a red flag right there. When the woman came back on the line I asked if I could speak with the manager. The woman who said her name was ""Wendy"" explained to me that she is the manager and asked what was wrong..I nicely explained that we ordered through Grub hub and that our chips were both wrong, my sandwich was without both cheese and mustard and my girlfriends sandwich was without cheese. This ""Wendy"" woman was extremely rude from the beginning, she blamed grub hub for the chips being wrong and told me she made our sandwich's herself and that ""maybe if you would pick up the other toppings you would find the cheese and mustard"" I thought for a second let me give her the benefit of the doubt and check again..at that point I used my fingers to basically dig through my sandwich even worse then I already had picked through it in the beginning and again came up empty..seeing absolutely no cheese or mustard anywhere. I then told the woman ""I am looking through my sandwich right now, I am not blind, and clearly these ingredients are not here."" She then got extremely angry and even more rude towards me and proceeded to call me a liar and tell me they put a very thin line of mustard and thin layer of cheese and that she knows the ingredients are there and that it's not her fault and that it is my problem if I cannot see them. At this point I picked every single ingredient off of my sandwich and sure enough NO CHEESE AND NO MUSTARD. The woman then told me to figure it out with grub hub then and hung up on me. I WAS SO ANGRY AND DISGUSTED WITH THE WAY I WAS TREATED AND WITH HOW I WAS LOOKED AT AND CALLED A LIAR. At this point my sandwich was demolished and disgusting plus was without the ingredients I asked for that would even allow it to taste good in the first place.

The best thing they could do for me is give me a 10% coupon for grub hub for my next order. If I had a vehicle at the time I would have made sure to go to the restaurant myself to show ""Wendy"" that she indeed did make a mistake and explain to her how poorly she had treated me and at the end of the day that's just not right and not how you treat or speak to customers.

I have worked at many restaurants, and the one thing I have always learned is that ""the customer is always right"". instead of yelling at me, making me feel like an idiot and calling me a liar..but most importantly not helping me to receive a new sandwich and not once taking responsibility instead of blaming the customer.. leaving me with a mangled mess that I didn't order as well as leaving me to feel angry, upset, and hungrier then ever. 

In conclusion to my story..I WILL NEVER EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT AGAIN, I HAVE POSTED ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND TOLD MANY PEOPLE NOT TO EAT HERE AND ABOUT HOW TERRIBLE THEY SEEM TO TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS. SO THANKS WENDY YOU'RE A REAL WINNER AND A GREAT EMPLOYEE. If I could give this place -5 stars I would..because honestly 1 Star is way too much."

Saleswoman walked in on me while I was in the dressing room a few days ago, and did not think there was anything wrong with this behavior until I pointed out that this was not appropriate. This was not an accident. She pulled back the curtain knowing that I was in there and without asking my permission. She later apologized and said, ""I could see that you were dressed."" I had pulled the curtain completely shut, but evidently my body was still visible, which also makes me feel very uncomfortable since the changing rooms open onto the store floor. 

Every time I go in here, the sales staff either interact so minimally with customers or ask me 4-5 times in 10 minutes if I need anything."

It's funny to think that when we walked into the dealership, the salesperson walked up to us and we immediately said sorry, we're here for Sir Winston's. I'm a little embarrassed I must say but not embarrassed enough to try their tasty food! I heard about this place from my fiancГ©'s coworkers so we decided to try it out!

Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. We went here on a Saturday around lunchtime and omg.. they only had one dish to serve...Chicken Kofta. A part of me wanted to walk out and the other half wanted to just try it. Luckily for them, I was satisfied. The portion was very generous, it came with one big chicken Kofta, rice, Greek potatoes, a dollop of tzatziki sauce and Caesar salad. The taste verdict: thumbs up! Flavourful and kept me full! 

I would give it another go...on a weekday for sure."

4azv5Q-1FPH6grFlWZCiTw,3jUEP5b0e9TLcvV1Ulj4dA,"Absolutely do NOT recommend! My dad was transferred from the hospital to Citadel after he had a mini stoke (and back-related left leg weakness/pain).

He was there LESS THAN 12 hours (probably about 8.5 hrs, so 1am) and he needed help to the restroom. He pushed the call button for the Nurse several times and NOBODY came. The (shared) room was tiny and his bed was probably 10-15 steps from his bed. He was tired of waiting and decided to make the trip himself however, I think almost as soon as he stood from the bed, he fell and hit his head! 

We (my mom and I) still don't know how he got up from the floor. We (my mom and I) assume somebody helped him up. However NOBODY called our house to notify us of his fall! We had to hear second hand from my Aunt (Dad's sister, who lives in Tennessee). My Aunt had called my Dad at the facility around 10am and my Dad mentioned falling in the night and then my Aunt called me to ask if I knew he had fallen, which I did not prior to my Aunt calling.

The case manager was busy (and that's fine she's one woman and has to prioritize her cases by level of urgency) and the Director of Nursing was not in her office (possibly at lunch, also fine) so there was nobody immediately available to discuss transferring him to a different facility. This was around 1pm. My dad fell asleep a few hours later and when the Nurse Practitioner came in to assess him, he would not wake up. 

They called the EMTs and decided to send him to the hospital which is where I am writing this review from. Because of the fall he has a possible concussion."

o0OD0UdzNpAJ1CTlW9Emsg,vKBmo6Afjz_wzaWCirQFsQ,"First contacted Sho (trainer/owner of business) 2nd week of June. Paid our deposit, went to location indicated and business is basement of residence.  Not a problem, as long as it's good.

1st class, 2 people signed up.  In the middle of the class Sho gets into an argument with the other student about negative reinforcement.

After the 1st class, no contact was made so we go to our designated out door location as planned.  Waited at the park and no one showed up.  I guess the other student cancelled.  Where was the communication? My time's pretty valuable too...

Reaching out to her afterwards and she says her dogs are going through some medical surgeries.  That's a bad excuse and not a good reason.  If I ran a business I'd make sure I contact my students that I can't make it.  Phone calls or emails don't take long at all.

Arrangements were made to have the class rescheduled, and by this time it's end of August.  In between was a lot of ""Can't this week, busy taking care of dog"" and ""I'm not available"".  In the end we asked for our money back, which was given but our EMT cost and time wasted was not reimbursed.  She didn't offer to give a discount given the hassles we've gone through.  It was either you want your money back or we'll try to schedule another class AGAIN!  At least offering a discount it would've made our hassles worth it!  Poor business practice!

We feel that our puppy's prime puppyhood was wasted having to deal with her constant excuses with delaying classes. We wasted our summer time to train her outdoors because of the constant delays and excuses.  In our OPINION, we feel that the constant delays have more of a connection with the lack of participants and students willing to sign up to her service.  But that's only our educated guess.

Let's just say we took our business elsewhere where it's run properly and has a storefront.  The business transaction handled between us was unprofessional to say the least."

He said his boss just texted him that the price was going up.   I said they just lost a long time customer. $15 just to dump an RV tank is ridiculous when many places are free.

RBEFjztls6xArCPUwX3EWA,VDJsOELtUAN3FXP3fI460g,"Forza stone is problematic in that it will crack and break easily as it did when the guys
installed my clients. Its much more expensive than traditional tile.
As far as water proof, you cant use it on the shower floor and most problems with showers occur at the shower floor. There are also no trim pieces to finish the edges, you will have to either pay extra or learn to be a tile pro.
I am in the remodel business as well and do not recommend forza stone due to cost and cracking and breaking of the sheets. The sheets also cause excessive waste of materials unless your shower lays out to full sheet sizes. Wrapping corners is also a problem such as the tub deck pictured. You would have to make the deck from a slab of stone that isnt the same stone. The aluminum backing can be seen if you want to turn any corners with this product."

She also tackled every question we had whether it was about exchanging money, to the weather to if we could take camera film with us. Her itinerary is extremely detailed to what specific time we should leave the hotels every morning, to what we are doing that day and the directions on how to get there. Would totally recommend her for planning your next vacation!"

My instructor, Tony Erikson was first rate. I have several several key pieces of information obtained from the course in my regular customer consulations. The material was challenging but the classes were small enough that we all were able to ask whatever questions we needed.

KE9zSVRiWi0GmZAq5PoimA,mOVyk3O18VY5nrUMTZgM1w,"One of the best things about my job - I carry my laptop around and can work from anywhere. Yes, that includes working from home. However, I do like going to my office downtown every so often. And sometimes, I like venturing out of the office for 2-3 hours and working from a public wi-fi. It was one of those days and I cho-cho-chose this location on Parliament and Dundas. 

Free wi-fi, nice indoor seating, and a cup of coffee and some good breakfast lured me in. I was hoping it'd be quieter but it was super busy. I got lucky and found seating - a 2 seater. I looked around for outlets - none to be found - which was quite disappointing, because I was hoping to work from Timmies for a few hours. And when you do the kind of work I do, laptop charge usually won't last for more than an hour. So, sadly, I had to finish up my breakfast and leave within the hour. 

Did I have a normal hour? No. Be prepared for hobos to walk in and try to find seating. The employees are usually too busy to notice. A hobo came up to me and asked me if he could sit across from me. And I felt bad, so I allowed him to take a seat. He, then, tried to strike up a very weird conversation. While I was in middle of a phone call, too. I didn't really respond, and I was hoping that he'd take the hint and go away. But nope, the dude totally sat and dozed off into sweet slumber. 10 minutes in, thwack! His head hit the table (and almost my laptop). He didn't wake up. In another 5 minutes, he was snoring. And I let out a sigh that he wasn't dead. 

When I left, he was still asleep. I would've loved to wait and see the ending to that story, but I had work to do!"
K9Ycc5lO5CCqH2KMZInZag,IAH-pnrF3TwhfZZU_tAWkw,"So this is a newly opened discount store right in Dixie Outlet Mall. It's at the same place previously as Sears. 
The place is well organized and you can get great stuff for extremely cut down prices. These are all branded stuffs like from Party City, Walmart, Claire's and many more. 
Many items are 50,60,70 and even 80% off. 
When asked an employee, they said they bought all stuff from Fort McMurray Retailers who were affected by the fires and they are selling at discounted prices, it is such a great gesture to help people as well. 
We got themed party stuff for cheap prices, lower than dollar stores as well. Like example 11 Big Tablecloths for only $8.50, there were plates at 70% off, countless Helium Balloons from Party City as well. Halloween Costumes for Cheap, 100 lights for only $2.00. 
There's a huge section for clothing as well, Cherokee trousers for only $7.00, kids socks for $0.50cents, heel shoes for $15.00, kids shoes for $5.00, we got a Claire's Baby Cap for $2, actual retail price $16.00.
Like others, I thought it would be cheap stuff, but it isn't it's really good quality stuff. 
As of now they are open only Fri, Sat and Sun and keep getting new stuff, definitely going again to stock up.
Totally recommend for Halloween and Christmas Seasons !!"

And they come to your fitting room to ask you to put your clothes on a rack after you try them on instead of leaving in the fitting room. Isn't that what they do? Put clothes away no matter what? Not going back ever again !

She has a pretty cool one that is pink camo designed and then another one that is carbon fiber, and I really like the carbon fiber one because it's got some kind of material on it that makes it almost softer and squishier kind of which made my hands get less tired. The controller also has different sticks on it that my hands slipped off less than a regular controller, and they also have this thing called and Evil D-Pad which was four buttons instead of a regular xbox dpad. Pretty neat. My roommate plays a lot more video games than I do, but I think it's pretty cool that there's a local company doing something like this, especially since they also make controllers for people with disabilities. It's pretty much a place where you order stuff online but I know you can go into the actual office and buy controllers there too."

My reaction was to think that the gent working the cash must've been helping a customer. Given the hour of operation on their website, I assumed they would be open, so I took a drive (20 mins) to the location. They were closed. I was upset that I wasted all that time driving to the store to get my stog. I probably should have realized that based on the phone not picking up that they were closed, but if that's the case, don't post it on the website as open. I've given my business to another shop in town, that has proven to be more consistent."
PAXUkXtz3YbzNZYlSTuMhA,3Vs2S3FQF_xobyuimSayDQ,"I hate writing bad reviews....but this one deserves it. I did not have dental insurance until just a few months ago. I would use Groupons for cleanings. I had one at Hudec that I used in April. It included X-Rays and an exam with the cleaning. They told me I had two cavities. I was shocked. I had not had any cavities since I was 18 and had been told by my previous dentist that I had really good teeth and probably would not have any cavities for a very long time, if ever. Of course, since I did not have dental insurance, it would be VERY expensive to have the cavities filled. So I procrastinated. Then I heard my company may be getting dental and I waited a bit more. We did get dental insurance and I was glad I waited! My old dentist was in my new network and I went back to him. I fully expected to be told I needed fillings and was hoping it wasn't too bad since I had waited. He told me I did not have any tooth decay at all. That my teeth looked good. So either Hudec was out to rip me off, or they are just really incompetent. Neither situation is good. I would stay well away from this dental office."
WYqCxJqDbAeKdgjBqzgMiQ,_aSStLGmkYvLiOMAgls_9g,"Having experienced chronic back pain/difficulties since I was 15, I have seen a parade of chiropractors during the ensuing 55 years. There were three favorites I've had during that time, two of whom I left because of my moving. Dr. Wunderlich is the third and I am delighted to have found him after trying several other chiropractors when we moved to Madison. The office atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and the treatments relieve my pain every time. So many others I've seen demand a regimen of treatment and don't really listen to the patient's issues; however, Dr. Wunderlich listens compassionately and treats accordingly. My husband and  daughter have also become patients along with my year old granddaughter who has issues for which she is being treated generously and compassionately. What I love is the ability to come in without an appointment, exactly when I begin to have a problem. It's convenient and fits my ever changing schedule."

I was doing some light window shopping and happened across Mellow Yellow or as like to call them, Sparkles and decided to take a quick peek.  

Upon entry I knew this place did not cater to my style.  They offer a large variety of bags, earrings, necklaces, and other accessories.  Also, they offer a small collection of clothing for size zero women.  Most of the accessories were very brightly colored, fake stones, and gaudy.  Not my style at all and not something I would ever try to pull off.

Some people may enjoy this look, just not me.  I leave this place for sparkly ladies.  Ladies, have at it!"
YpaPEPHta-ERTssUrlOtCA,Eynm2jp5AeXSmlZntZraKw,"Initially I liked to visit Ambal only because they are the only big store in downtown that sells South Indian / Srilankan groceries, although the store is congested and dirty. They put the fish items besides vegetables / spices which is quite repulsive for vegetarians like me. Lately I go there only if I have to as :
1. they sell expired items and don't take it back. They even argue that best before is not the same as expired!
2. they have horrible customer appreciation. As a regular customer, one should be treated with more respect but the main (old) man yells at you if you try to tell him that the product has expired / not good.
They need to be taught how to behave with customers/women."

AW7xZy1UkI1yxs4KuEvsqg,RbCZaLOmEZxyy1aVe8WlpA,"Thanks YELP users.  We searched rental car agency in Scottsdale before choosing this one. Took the bus over from the terminal, the staff here was fast and friendly, we were in and out in minutes. We haven't rented a car in a very long time, but this was super easy, 

When driving out of the rental car lot, the oil light came on.  We continued on to our hotel and decided we would check the oil when we got there.  The next day, we called the Enterprise office and told them about the oil light.  The young man checked the records, said it had an oil change two days before.  No worries.  We never did check the oil until we arrived in Flagstaff, 175+ miles since picking it up.  Pulling off the interstate at Flagstaff, the motor began coughing.  We called the Flagstaff office and they brought over another car for us right away.  Were the same kind of friendly easy to work with folks we met in Scottsdale.  

We turned the second car in at the airport in Las Vegas.  We didn't have the same car as our paperwork, we had no paperwork for the second car.  We were afraid it would either be super easy or super intense once we turned the car in.  The assistant Manager, Nick, greeted us and thanked us, sent us on our way.  The easiest thing ever!"

nmt9VR8LubDsJDT7QTE3bQ,Q1M-ZNimeELw5J666FYrcg,"Can't believe there were no reviews for this restaurant. Let's get started!

The inside of the restaurant had only a few tables, but was quite spacious so it didn't feel overcrowded at all. We must have waited 30 minutes for the food to come out even though there were only 3 tables, but the overall quality was worth the wait. 

Complimentary bread was served cold with whipped butter. It was certainly soft on the inside but super tough around the edges (cut into my upper palate)--would have tasted better had it been warmed up, but did not end up eating it in the end to save stomach space. 

Am happy to report that the Shrimp and Salmon Linguine (between $18-19) was quite delicious. Linguine was al dente; still pipping hot when it came out. The only drawback was that there were only 3 pieces of shrimp but enough perfectly cooked salmon pieces to redeem itself in a ""creamy"" tomato sauce as advertised on the menu. Personally, I would have preferred the sauce creamier, but it was not bad. 

My SO couldn't stop babbling about how delicious the Slow Stewed Short Rib (between $29-$32) was. The meat fell apart easily like the texture of pulled pork. You could tell it was marinated very well and slow cooked for some time to lock in the flavours. Tasted pretty good with the mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables it came with.

Both portions were perfectly sized and we walked away happy on a full stomach.

Note to the business: Please update your menus because there are no longer Shrimp and Scallop Linguine which was the only thing I came for.

Overall verdict? Parking was difficult to find but the food was delicious even though it took a long time to come out. Will definitely return to try other items. Hopefully by then the menu would have been updated online to reflect accurate dishes and prices so that when customers arrive they are not shocked to find discrepancies."

But having said that, I found Karen's teaching to be helpful and attentive - and in the end transformative.  I think that some yoga students misperceive the Iyengar ""method"" as being too strict, which might account for some people's reactions.  My own take is that through learning certain very specific actions and awareness, one can develop ""less"" constriction in one's body and mind.

I loved it - the facility is nice in a simple way.  The real deal, not McYoga."

X7xBmi1DLl1B_JvA3dwrAw,RJXZIwYFPI2IGUCthCkcNg,"I've been to Lashious twice. The first time I was with Tania, second time with Kasia. As a relative newbie to lash extensions I was glad Kasia took the time on my first visit to walk me through different lash lengths, thickness, and materials. I've heard horror stories where girls develop allergic reactions to the extensions - I'm allergic to cats, so was glad Kasia suggested synthetic rather than silk or mink. Both Tania and Kasia were very friendly. The facilities itself is in a cozy home on 14 St (entrance is through side of house). One thing I noticed and appreciated about the facilities is its cleanliness. This was seen in reception area, bathroom as well as the work stations. Tools are organized on a trolley and there is a sanitation station in the room. There are comfortable beds (that warm up!), blankets and pillows, and soothing piano music playing which make the entire experience very relaxing. I almost fell asleep both times. Both times the girls had to get up at one point during the appointment to either greet an incoming client or take a call - which is fine and expected - and I appreciated them using hand sanitizer before getting back to work on me. These small things really show hygiene is top of mind here. 

In terms of the actual service, the first time I got a free leg massage - I think because I was a new client. That was a treat. I have very sensitive eyes that spaz if there are foreign objects being used in the vicinity. Both times the ladies were accommodating and able to work around my twitching eyes. The first time I got lashes done, I opted for the thicker synth lashes. The end result was a very full, dark lash look. Tania did mention at the end of the service that because I have thin lashes, it was difficult for the thicker lashes to bond to my lash, so she used a variety of thick and thin. This would later make sense because many of the lashes began to fall off the 3-5 days following my service date. I was disappointed because I do not wear eye make up which usually helps extend the life of extensions. Previous times I've gotten extensions at other salons have mostly stayed in tact for at least 2.5-3 weeks with minimal fall outs. I felt it had something to do with the fact that thicker lashes were used. Fast forward to my 2nd (fill) appointment I fed this back to Kasia and she used the thin lashes instead. 7 days after my service date, no major concerns with the lashes coming off so I think the result of my 1st appointment had to do with the fact that I asked for the thicker lashes and not with the workmanship. I'm pleased with my lashes and even more so by the service of Lashious. PS. Tip: If you rebook right away for your next appt, you get 10% off."

It wasn't enough to distract me from the practice; I actually fell out cold asleep during our shavasana  LOVE YOU DIRTYOGA LADIES!

Edb_Bhss_sL_Ip-UHhWo8Q,Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"What an enormous crazy labyrinth of a building! I suppose this was a factory of some sort... ahem, quick Google suggests that yes! This was a factory built in the 1880s to make textiles that at one point employed over 3000 people. Then it was a toy factory where they made Pong! Over the decades a lot of the original building was covered up but a restoration project focused on the original plans and the Chateau now stands as an impressive wall of 19th red stone. It houses lofts, offices, a restaurant and more and it's an easy place to get lost in for sure, but the getting lost leads out onto wide wooden hallways, and looming glass doorways the open out onto surprising stone courtyards. I think this could be an amazing space for all kinds of big and small events..  A place I intend to spend more time discovering, but maybe I'll wait till summer.."
VjiZ0hf5u0DqpAa0UfCQOg,Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Just a little park across from Leonard Cohen's house, just a sweet little place where we go to drink a coffee, listen to the old people, feed the pigeons, and a place where we came together when we lost a friend to sing the old songs of peace and revolution. Just a tiny square with a beautiful old gazebo and small tiles lining the tiny walkways. A piece of the old Main, sitting across from new wave cafГ© bar Darling, remembering. Sometimes there is also live band karakoe here, sometimes there are dance classes. The apartments around it are in varying degrees of decay and heritage. It's just one block, a couple trees, a place to meet."

First went to him when we lived in Sun City Grand and have continued to go even after we moved to North Phoenix. He is AWESOME!  Does a super job and is a great conversationalist.

SWX0K1dpy4fcRq-ktZxmCg,Wc5L6iuvSNF5WGBlqIO8nw,"Tucked in a heritage building with its terrace perched on a rushing set of streams within the Riviere des Prairies, this Bistro is a mellow, modern gem that remembers 19th century Montreal. Veggies here are market fresh, steaks are grilled on an outdoor bbq, and the menu is creative and delicious: we loved the mint pea soup and the papardelle with panchetta, wild mushrooms and almonds. About a 15 minute drive north of the Plateau, this bistro is off the beaten path for some Montrealers but the food in addition to the surrounding forest, riverfront, and architecture make it well worth the trip. Bonus: walk across the bridge to the island bird sanctuary at sunset, watch the woods for fireflies."
v0oHkLaA7cI9os6VZu6NZQ,GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,"Came by last weekend while I was in the area as I wanted to try this place out. There is a location much closer to me, but I wanted to try Don's out at a new location and this location just recently opened up. 

I came fairly early around 10:30 am and the place was empty. I quickly looked at their large menu before deciding on getting the chicken burrito. My guest got the #6 Beef burrito & cheese enchilada combo but made the burrito a bean and cheese and they aren't really into so much meat. This combo cost just $7.01. We also got a regular drink which cost $1.87.

While we waited for our food, I looked over the inside and took pictures for Yelp. Everything was clean and new looking. All the drink stations were clean and filled as well as the salsa bar. The floors were clean and free of all trash. I didn't notice if they have a restroom for their customers or not. 

Food came out quickly and was fresh and hot, probably a little too hot. Had to wait for my burrito to cool down some just to be able to pick it up. I don't usually get burritos at fast food Mexican places, but the chicken burrito sounded really good. The chicken had a lot of flavor to it and was very moist. My complaint about the burrito was the fact that the chicken had a lot of juice and it made the tortilla soggy so quickly. Also, I didn't realize it would just be chicken. I like other things like rice, beans, or even some lettuce and tomatoes added as well. Would I get this burrito again, probably not as I don't like soggy burritos. I, however, would come back again and try something else. 

They have 99 cent Taco Tuesdays which I will definitely try as I love tacos!

The employees were very friendly and smiled a lot. They made conversation and actually acted like they wanted to serve their customers."
RsITcgr_hgQqF60P5TAtww,Hi2O8HI-i9KfkAlJOdYzzw,"More than 100 hours spent driving and spending time in Avail Vapor to get to know the people as well as to check out their products and juices. We've tasted every flavor made available and have of course spent a lot of money shopping as we enjoyed the flavors.

To start this out I must point out that we've over the last few months have been traveling very long distances to check out different vape shops, and at times ran into shops that almost turned our thoughts from vaping. We've visited shops that the staff working there didnt even vape nor knew a thing about what they were happy to sale us, well that isnt the case with Avail Vapor.

From our very first stop into Avail Vapor just outside of Charlotte, NC, located in a small town called Concord; we found one of the top shops to date. When entering the shop we were treated extremely pleasant, the staff were extremely friendly and knowledgeable of their products. In some cases it seemed as if everyone in this shop had actually gotten an education in what they were there to do, and it also felt like a family environment.

Within our first trip we spent probably 4 hours in the shop chatting about different flavors as they helped us find the right ones for our needs. The shop was very beautiful and professionally setup with a themed layout displaying all types of tips on better living without smoking cigarettes, it was a very positive experience here. We were informed of the making of the juices as well as a nice history of how and where the juice originated, this made of feel really great about what we were soon to purchase. Of course we bought a ton of great things like new tanks, and some of our favorite flavors in which we will explore in other reviews; I think the best part of the first trip was the atmosphere and the staff.

Several trips of visiting Avail Vapor of Concord, and meeting many different members of their staff and not one moment went by in these visits were we feeling like it wasnt exactly like the first visit. We also ran into many of the same repeated clients which had nothing but great things to say as they shared their experiences with us about their vaping lifestyle, juices, and other shops. Visiting Avail Vapor to restock our juices has each time been like hanging out with good friends and we highly recommend them to any Vape lovers within the NC area or in the states in which you have an Avail Vapor Store.
Now, I had not wanted to mention too much about the juices themselves by Avail due to the reviews going up soon on each flavor; but I must say the juices are amazing. The finest example to describe any of the juices made by Avail Vapor are to say their rich, extremely bold, and distinguished. If you like cereal tasting juices then you will have the taste of that cereal as if you were eating a bowl while you vape. Be sure to check out the reviews on each of their juices in the coming articles.

9-yRTZGbhNwvDhxRKqZmtQ,Aqtnyl-rhUZF_zxDXlf0sw,"Bombay style street food with an all you can eat buffet - pav bhaji, pani puri, Vada pav, samosa as well as South Indian staples like dosa and idli and upma. Nice to see this concept of all of you can eat street food.

The Bombay side of their menu is way better than the South Indian - I advised them to focus on it. Service was friendly but their rate of replenishment for menu items left a bit to be desired.

This location in Brampton is bigger but much plainer than the earlier one in Mississauga. 

Don't know how good the Ala carte is."
3Oxoahbk05uMm3vPb3xjlg,b39IckHDyVLVSGYhy6Sszg,"Whenever I want to get something at Pharmaprix, this is the one I usually go to mainly due to location. They are situated at a strip/parking mall and right across the street from the Cote Vertu metro station (and Cote Vertu bus terminal where a lot of buses stop).

They generally have plenty of items that are advertised as being on sale in their flyer.

Unlike the other pharmacies that I've gone to (Jean Coutu and Walmart), when getting your prescription filled here, they will give you a ""pager"" so you can walk around the store and continue your shopping. Once your prescription is ready, they will buzz your pager informing you that you can head back to the prescription medication section to pick up and pay for your prescription. At the same time, they will also ring up any items that you want to purchase from the store so you don't have to pay for your prescription and then line up at the cash register near the exit to pay for your other items (but most of the other pharmacies that I've gone to will also do this).

To be honest, I don't go to Pharmaprix that often since I find Pharmaprix's non-sale prices to be more expensive than at other pharmacy prices or grocery store prices. This Pharmaprix does have a large grocery section where you can find things that you can also find at a depanneur (prices are generally cheaper than at a depanneur). The only thing is that they are right beside a large grocery store (Provigo) so you can get all your grocery items at Provigo. However, if you are already in Pharmaprix (for whatever reason), you can get your grocery items or snacks at the same time without having to leave and go to another store."
3MFd1h2Cp3HSTLjgCaxxCg,xeyvojVXURKUhOUtMBkf4Q,"I got a great Boxing Day bargain on a double din stereo. Yelp suggested Safe and Sound. I dropped by late in the afternoon and made an appointment for installation the next day. Mo is a true professional and very knowledgeable . 

Installation of the head unit is seamless, they routed the microphone to the top of the windshield with a clean and flush dash integration (looks like oem).

With the upgrade from a stock cassette radio, the oem car speakers were lacking in the low range. So, I ended up coming back to get a mono amp and subwoofer installed a few weeks later. (same day this review was submitted)

I am extremely satisfied with the quality of work and service from Safe and Sound. I will definitely go back for my next audio and dash cam installation .

Thanks guys!"

98GWHzPAfc5gyXEiYvr7BQ,Dk5GmgV7shRjLqopNGQ9rA,I found this store to be very clean and neatly organized compared to some of the other locations. It was well lit and stocked. The only thing that bothered me was that I had to stand in the front of the store for over 10 minutes before someone came to check me out. I was also advised that they could not blow up a specific hellium balloon that I wanted. I was told that it is against the store policy to do that. Why have options if you can't have them. Made no sense to me. I will just go up the street to the 99Вў store from now on.

When this restaurant was the Green Chili, it was fantastic. Under new ownership and the new name, they obviously didn't keep the recipes or the cook! Too bad.
Bland bland bland. No flavour to anything and the food wasn't even properly cooked.
After I told the waiter that I was very disappointed, the owner came by to apologize, and even after telling him again what was wrong with the meal (we only ate about half of it) he still charged us full price. He gave me a $25 discount certificate for ""next time"". Why would there ever be a next time?
Terrible food and terrible customer service."

The staff and owner are always very helpful and willing to assist whenever they aren't helping someone else. It's too bad that so many folks that stop in can't see the bigger picture and that the item they might be attempting to pawn isn't worth as much as they expected.

Arrived for a show before doors opened and thought we had the wrong place because no one else was there. Some workers told us the show was still going on and to come back when doors open. When we did only a few cars showed up. From there the night just got worse. Doors opened 15 minutes late and when we were going through security, we found out the event for all ages was a 21 and over event. So needless to say two of the teens we had brought with us had to go into a seperate room for the show. This was a load of crap because the security for the room let a man bring in alcohol and drink it for 45 minutes. Finally after telling management about 3 times,  something was done.  But back to security,  when we were trying to get in security started to flip out on my boyfriend during the frisk. All my boyfriend was doing was emptying his pockets as instructed ... 

As for the set,  the main act didn't start until 12:45. First some bad dj music played, then an opening band,  more sad dj music,  and then a second opening band! Then after the third set of dj music the main act's band played!  The main guy we came to see made us wait another 15 minutes for him! No wonder the place barely had anyone in it.  Needless to say 3 1/2 hours of my life was wasted.  This place blows."

uAX_EAU1r6J3JwPeX7uGrA,_w8R7yV5oMZQcoYDOhbX-g,"The hiking outside of Vegas was a great treat! My dad & I flew into Vegas for a day before heading off for a week of Utah backpacking. Our flight arrived early a.m. & we had a lot of time to kill waiting for my sister's evening flight, so we headed off to check out the scenery around Vegas. We weren't staying on the strip so we were able to get a taste of the city away from the typical tourist spots. We drove toward the mountains bordering Vegas while using Yelp to direct us to a place to hike. We arrived at the red rocky mountainous terrain & felt like we were a world away from the bright neon lights. The red rocks were strikingly beautiful but the hiking & scrambling upwards is what we enjoyed the most and the effort was rewarded with scenic views. 
It was a side of Vegas that I wasn't aware existed. I've visited Vegas several times throughout my life and always with friends & had never strayed away from the strip. I forgot we were hiking around Vegas while here & felt like I was in a remote area of the southwest. We were able to meet many locals that greeted us kindly and chatted with us, even giving useful advice for some scenic sights to stop off to see on the road trip to Zion. We only had a few hours to explore but we wished we had more as there was plenty here to see & we were interested in going deeper into the area. I highly recommend the hiking & scenic views. I now have a more beautiful image come to mind when reminded of Vegas."

I was in this store for over 6hrs in a matter of 3 days and came away empty handed due to the staff not having a proper understanding of how to properly to do their job.  Each associate, including the store manager, does NOT have the authority to make any decisions.  They had to call a district manager to determine how to process things the right way, and furthermore they would go in the back store room to talk to the DM on the phone, leading me to believe they were hiding something.

This is NOT a corporate Verizon Store and should be avoided at all costs.

After refusing to work with this store any longer I went to a Verizon corporate store and all of my issues were resolved in less than 30 minutes.

I came from Sprint and was extremely excited to begin my contract with Verizon.  While my cell service with Verizon has been excellent to date, this Digitell store left a sour taste in my mouth about switching over.

Lesson learned - go to a corporate store from day one."
jza5SqTdJQ4MfCCIuWWURw,3SFMmDGQn27dz7kMxdccZQ,"We bought the groupon that they offer online. We had so much fun here! The employees were SO kind and personal. 

I was nervous beforehand, but it ended up being perfectly fine for me to handle! I had this irrational fear that I was going to accidentally be shot by air soft bullets-but this does NOT happen. It's completely safe! 

They do a very good instructional intro at the beginning showing you what to expect and how to shoot the guns. You basically clear each room and shoot out targets. The first time we went through, all of the lights were on. The second time, lights were dimmed with strobe lights and the third time, no lights and only strobe lights. They do have the capability to keep the strobe lights off for those who are bothered by them. 

I really liked that they had an employee go through and follow you through the course. At the end, they tell you if you've missed any targets and you have to run back through. 

We tried doing the course alone and as a team of two-both were fun!! We will be coming back with friends to enjoy this spot again! Lots of fun and a very unique experience!"

I have to agree, Sebastian's hair design in not at all pretentious. 

Sebastian did my hair 4 times in a row and did a fantastic job. He is very precise, a good listener and understood my quirky hair. Excellent stylist which explains why he owns the place :-)

My problem, which turned out to be a deal breaker was the receptionist Ashley. When I arrived 5 minutes early for my 4 PM appointment she was lounging on the chairs/sofa at the window. She let me stand looking at an empty reception desk for a bit until she got up. Can't even say she greeted me. 

She was incredibly rude, actually disdainful is a better description. I felt like a ""walk-in"" at a busy salon. She gave me the fastest shampoo ever and literally slapped down magazines in front of me. Unreal. I am not a ""tough customer"", but this girl has a very big chip on her shoulder.

Sebastian is so good, that I booked another appointment after following up. However, I really don't want to deal with the likes of Ashley and Traci giggling and chatting while I wait to at least be acknowledged, only to feel like I am an intruder (with an appointment).

There is one good thing about pretentious - great customer service. I don't need great, just as good as I get when I buy my milk at Metro at Yonge & Lawrence i.e. Hi, Thank you.

The explanation for this horrible experience is: Sebastian's doesn't have/can't afford a receptionist/shampoo assitant. Ashley (though I have never seen her cut and style hair) is insulted be be referred to as a ""Receptionist"", although she sits at the front desk (well on the sofa at the window!). Ok, fair enough.

Sebastian should hire a receptionist if Ashley is too busy styling hair - which I must say I have never seen. Buyer beware.

For a great service experience across the board -- on every level -- and great prices I have found a neighbourhood gem. Calia Hair Design. Will write a review soon. They are fantastic! One door closes and a better one opens!"

I can't believe how perfect they are now. She really took her time to make sure my brow shape matched my face and that I was happy with it before she started.В 


When they first got done they looked much darker, but Julie assured me it would lighten within a week. She was right. After a week the color lightened and perfectly matched my natural eyebrow color. My skin peeled a little like a sun burn the first week and was a bit itchy but she gave me a take home cream to keep it moisturized which she said speeds up the healing. Overall the healing process was very easy and only caused me a minor inconvenience. It was totally worth getting these brand new eyebrows!"""

Well, the ranger stopped over to us DRIVING ON THE GREEN. He proceeded to sit there and watch us as we were continuing to play and would not leave us alone because we were ""taking too long"". He treated us disparagingly with zero respect. We even let people pass us! I am very understanding that people pay money to own a membership here but we came for a business golf outing and bottom line, we paid money to play. We had one person out of our whole party who wasn't very good at the game and took a little longer than someone who is apt at golfing. We left and we couldn't even get our money back! It's a shame because the course is absolutely beautiful! But do not come here if you aren't a member as you are not made to feel welcome.

tMG7AOpAKHlkKbYIZjgG9w,ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,"We completely gutted our home and remodeled, from the beginning, the entire house.  We started out with another AV company that was a disaster, then we met James with SDC and our life became organized and easy.  James and his team are very knowledgeable, professional, yet friendly, and RELIABLE.  

They hooked up our entire home.  Now we have sound throughout the entire house (inside/outside), internet that actually works throughout the house and backyard, an automated front doorbell system (it's a life saver), our shades are automated, security system with cameras and even our heating/air conditioning.  We can use our system from our iPhones, iPads from anywhere in our home or even away from home.

Now we can see what our dogs are up to, (or gardener), when we are not home.  The options were endless.  They have an advanced system for making and keeping appointments, and they text you confirmations and/or changes, so that you always have a record of when you should expect them.  

They have NEVER been late, or missed an appointment.  One of most loved traits, was that if something was being difficulty, they would not sit here eating up time (and money) to figure it out.  They would go back to their office and research, figure out a solution and come back and make it happen.  VERY ethical in their business practices.  Our first AV person gouged us with equipment pricing, SDC is upfront about all pricing and do not look to add cost to equipment.

I can not say enough about them.  We are going to miss having them in our home.  

EXTRA BONUS POINTS - They rescue dogs.  If you follow my reviews, you KNOW this everything to me.

Oh and they have interior decorators that work with them to help make your home look beautiful AND technologically advanced.  A real smart home, that looks smart."

She also gives great haircuts too! I'm trying to grow mine, so she makes sure to trim just a little bit. Whatever you want to do she'll do it!

Dr Shapiro fixed my initial coccyx problem over several months but I found I liked how I felt after an appointment with him.  He also fixed a reoccuring knee problem by analyzing my gait and getting me into some custom designed shoe inserts.

I regularly workout with weights and cardio and travel extensively for business and going to Dr. Shapiro once a month to be  straightened out and patched up has become part of my body's maintenance routine. I also occasionaly suffer a muscle  tear, strain, etc., and Dr. Shapiro and his staff use a combination of massage therapy, laser treatments, and other advanced techniques to fix me up again so I continue working out.

I've not been to any other chiroprators but I'm so happy with Dr. Shapiro  that I routinely drive in all the way from North East Mesa to South Tempe and have periodically referred friends and family to him when they need chiropractic help."

No matter how your kid acts they will make it seem like your kid has talent. After waiting 3 hours to talk to the lady my 14 month old son was ready for a nap and horrible. She said they are looking for kids that are fussy and all over the place. ""He's like a real kid"" she says, ""that's exactly what baby gap is looking for"".

Either way, it was a dark and stormy Tuesday.... and seriously it was. So when I walked in about 6:30 there wasn't a customer in site and the ladies jumped to pamper me with a mani-pedi combo. I went with the gel manicure and was SUPER impressed. They care OPI shellac and not only does it come in 25+ shades but the manicure truly did last 15 days. (Disclaimer: My last attempt at shellac lasted 4. I work with my hands at my job and it's tough to keep polish on, no matter what you do!).

The services took a little longer than normal which I enjoyed - a true pampering experience! The salon was clean, well lit, tastefully decorated and had the latest and greatest looking pedicure chairs for your enjoyment too. Definitely my favorite salon in Ballantyne and maybe in Charlotte!"

The venue itself is beautiful and classy. Ample room to dance (which I LOVE) and sexy features. They also have a rooftop patio if you so choose to smoke or get some fresh air.

Music was on-point - great selection!

We were there for several hours and it wasn't very packed. Maybe due to the newness? Maybe needs better promoters? Also, not to be snobby, there were some ppl there who didn't meet the dress code. I mean, I'm talking short ""vacation"" shorts which weren't very dressy."

rRipevyN-e02yOxI_Afoxw,eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,"I have been a part of UNLV for nearly a decade as either a student or employee. And yet tonight was my first time checking out a UNLV baseball game. It all started with an email I saw yesterday advertising $2 Tuesday. $2 game tickets when purchased online. $2 hot dogs. $2 off beer. That sounds like an ideal way to spend a Tuesday evening. So I grabbed my dad and hit the ball park. 

This was not the ideal evening I had planned on. It was cool and windy tonight. A little uncomfortable for me but not too bad. Where I was sitting on the 3rd base line was mostly sheltered from the windin fact, it looked like most every seat is sheltered from the wind as long as it doesn't blow from the North. Tonight it was blowing from the Southwest. The announcers box, bleacher wall, concessions wall and bathroom walls do a good job blocking. And walking up some steps to get in and down to sit lead to futher protection. What they could not protect against was the stadium lights that would not turn on on the first base line. The game had to be delayed by 7:20, or mid 3rd inning, until an electrician could make the necessary fixes. My dad and I left at this point because we were cold and felt we had seen our $2 worth of baseball.

Overall, I am impressed with Earl E Wilson Stadium. The seats are nice. The price is right even without it being $2 Tuesday. The grass is well maintained. The restrooms are acceptably clean. And they have a nice meatball sandwich. It isn't the largest meatball sub I've had but it was better than I expected it to be. Four or five fresh tasting meatballs on a toasted roll with pleanty cheese. It was more than a $2 hot dog but this is Vegas and I am willing to bet it was better too."

""I can't come back tomorrow, I have class and flying back to Los Angeles.""  

So she calls another store to see if they have some.  I get directions from the employee at the other store, and head around 20 miles away so I can find the curds tonight.  

The kicker ... when I get to the other store and see what cheese curds looked like, I realize that there was plate out on the counter at this store.  Why didn't she say, ""Here are some samples, would you like to try one?"""

I called ahead and made an appointment for a manicure and pedicure.  I arrived on time and, Coco, the esthetician was ready for me - no waiting for her to finish someone else's nails, etc.  The gentleman (owner I think) at the front was very friendly and offered me a beverage.

I sat in one of the awesome massage chairs while getting the pedicure.  Instead of using the blade and/or a foot file, she used this other device that looked similar to a microplane which really got the job done. Then I got a hot stone massage which felt amazing!  Both manicure and pedicure were done to perfection - cuticles clipped well, nails filed evenly, polish properly applied with no spots missing.  Also, they use OPI Drip Dry which, in my opinion, is the only way to go to quickly dry nails.

What I really appreciated was the excellent customer service.  I asked Coco just to fix one of my nails and she was happy to do it - no attitude problem like some places out in Mississauga.  Another lady, who had just had a manicure the other day, walked in and asked them to fix a clipped nail and they were so happy to oblige.  I really felt that the gentleman/owner and the staff genuinely appreciate the business and go of their way to make the customers happy.

The manicure and pedicure package was only $35 (prior to taxes and gratuities).

Thanks to Tamara P. for her review and introducing us to this great local Etobicoke business!

First red flag should have been when we picked it up. The gas was on empty and they didn't even have it cleaned. Are you kidding me? This is how a so called reputable dealership delivers its cars to customers???

Our sales rep (Gabriel) kept calling my husband ""Bro"" which was quite bizarre, its unprofessional and downright insulting to speak to customers that way. He used that reference over 50 times.. bizarre.

So fast forward to May 2017. We go in for a routine oil change only to find out that two of the shocks are out and it's leaking oil???? Are you serious??

This vehicle was not properly tested for safety before leaving the dealership.. UNACCEPTABLE!! I drive my three children to and from school in that vehicle and it was leaking oil the whole time?!?

Buyers beware before purchasing a vehicle. Have your mechanic check it out. The best part of the experience was when the Service Manager (Domenic Almonte) said he replaced the two shocks before putting it on the lot..

Yeah right! Any problem that causes leaking is due to a problem that has been there for awhile. They should not talk to customers as if their idiots, or maybe he thought because I was a woman he could say whatever he wanted.
 
I bought a Toyota Corolla 1.5 years ago with 70,000 kms and have yet to fix something on it. 


So my husband was given a price on a Friday to have it fixed. Come the following Tuesday there was a $100 added to the cost.

Service manager said he would help in bringing down the cost and labour cost but did not. Not only that, he never even came out of his office when he saw that I had gotten the paperwork or even say goodbye.

As I was paying he just walked right by me like he didn't even know who I was.

The cherry on top was when he sent a ""Thank you for servicing with us"" generic letter the next day.

Our instructor was very nice. I totally forgot her name. She was awesome, she's very interactive in the class. She does walk around the room periodically to make sure you are in the right position which is quite helpful because I can tell you I had no clue as to what I as doing.

The whole class was awesome, we all definitely felt the burn. By the way, it was the Barre Classic class which is recommended for beginners.

It's a mixture of yoga, stretching and ballet moves, which by the way, were awesome practises that you can do at home. Who knew about these ballet moves??

When the class was over she interacted with us for a bit which was nice. They have a lot of specials/deals right now that are awesome. The one class by itself was $20. It was totally worth it. I can't tell you it was worth it because I could hardly get out of my bed this morning.

d-w5ZTjtPz8UV0wCDwko2Q,Bomsd1OFq6IsbDhAkdg3pg,"Hiring Blooming Desert to handle the landscaping for my new home was one of the best decisions I have made. From the conception of the project to the final touches, Brian and his team at Blooming Desert were attentive, professional, and exceeded my wildest expectations. Brian understood what I wanted in the design of my yard and was able to bring my dream into reality. He was thorough in drawing up the plans and laying out exactly what was to be done, which was not small feat considering the size of my project. In one area we removed a small play pool and replaced it with a large diving pool and spa. On the side yard we transformed it from a giant cement slab into a lush turtle pond and sitting area. Whenever I called, Brian answered the phone and listened to me as well as explained what was going on. If he did not know the answer to my question(s) he said he would find out the answer and get back to me quickly which he always did. When ""cans of worms"" (as he and his project manager, Kent, called them) were opened during my project, they worked hard to figure out a timely, cost effective, and reasonable solution. Kent was also professional, efficient, and easy to communicate with. The pool supervisor, Pete, far exceeded my expectations when he noticed some water where it should not have been, checked into it, and then shut off the water main to my house when he realized I had a burst pipe in the wall of my master bathroom. His attention to detail and taking the time to figure out what was going on saved us extensive damage and cost. I am impressed with their skill, communication and professionalism from beginning to end. I am so happy with the final product--my yard is a sanctuary and a resort--thanks to Blooming Desert."

Then they don't cooperate with the investigations and (think) they are getting away with it. No more Dotty's. No more. I have the police report that states you aren't cooperating. All of a sudden you have no security company and never have per an employee. Hmm? You had one that gave video footage to the police. Yet you haven't turned the suspects info over to police. I won't stop until justice is served for the thief and the employee that was working that night is fired. The manager needs to clean house there. Maybe they will get regular customers back who have enjoyed it there for a long time. Criminals are driving good customers away.

Over a year ago I had an issue with a security system company.  They charged me a 300 dollar installation when it was suppose to be a ""no cost install.""  I constantly complained and nothing was done about it.  At the time I did not have a LegalShield membership and I decided to not pay them anything instead.  A year later I received a bill for $1492.58.  I contacted my lawyer and they advised me to contact the company to get a copy of the contract.  After all was said and done, the company could not provide me with the proper documentation and because of that they disregarded the payment.

-5gSPcauy5_JCQeHiJgFmw,q_GNUKJXBlMnuezCaxTNOw,"This place sucks.
They cater to the vendors. They should have separate hours for vendor's. I do not mean the early business hrs. I mean a whole separate deal for smoke shop vendors, or at least have another person in the tabaco area for those who only want a few items. 
If there is only 2 people allowed at a time in the cage then u should be posting a sign so that people know this. But no sign is posted and I was told to get back out. So I left the store and my full cart. I will no longer go to this Sams.
One more thing why is it that anyone can use my card when its my name on the card and my picture? What ever happened to checking the card name and verify it? They do not do this any longer. I don't think they should charge a membership then. Wasn't that the reason for getting a membership so not people that paid for memberships could get in not those people that did not pay for a membership.

P6N8qIUlu2IEKr1_pdg00Q,pkpzIhX1mNzLLEEyj4syKQ,"Living in the South Side, there are plenty of pizza options near us. Recently, we've been trying different places just to mix it up, especially because the last few times we've ordered from our usual pizza place it hasn't been up to par. 

We decided to go with Amili's because it's not only close by, but because they had a great deal (large two topping pizza, Italian hoagie, breadsticks and a bottle of Coke). We also had an ad from them in our takeout folder that we accumulated somehow. 

I was pleased from the start when I called and the man who took my order was very friendly. No hassle and took the time to make sure the order was correct. 

We picked it up and it was ready within 20 minutes as promised. The pizza was awesome! It was cooked perfectly and had a nice balance of sauce and cheese. My boyfriend doesn't usually eat crust but he ate all of Amcili's! Breadsticks were good. They're much thinner than the usual breadstick and topped with what tasted like a garlic parm dressing. Hoagie was standard and they definitely weren't cheap with the toppings and meat like some pizza places. It was a little messy and some of the lettuce was a little hard (could have been from the core), but it still satisfied my appetite nonetheless. 

We definitely will be ordering again and I'm excited to try some of their other options."
YKEfXcJFJQ8uIDsBywAO3g,FmykbvmPgMxGNZ-ybtN8yA,"The theater is older, true. It doesn't have stadium seating. The cupholders are on the seat in front of you. If you love movies and movie theaters though I think you'll be pleasantly surprised here. The sound and picture are great.

What made me fall in love with this place was the feeling that the owners and employees actually cared. I went around Halloween and the lobby was decorated in every nook and cranny. You know the piles of movie posters and promotional material that every theater gets? They actually put all those posters up instead of just sticking the cardboard stands randomly around the lobby and tossing the posters in the trash. The place has character.

I love seeing movies in theaters because of the atmosphere that it adds to the film. It seems like the latest theaters just don't get that. They throw in stadium seating and some IMAX screens and call it a day. I don't know whether it's the owners or the employees here (or both) but someone loves movies.

As others have said it's a pain to find if you've never been there. If you're on Clairton Blvd go into the Southland shopping center. The theater is BEHIND the strip mall (behind Panera)."

Pinney is a small neighborhood branch that had a lot of patrons hanging out in the library on a summer Saturday. It's nice to see that's it's a great neighborhood meeting spot and not just a place to pop in and out of when you pick up your items. 

The two women staffing the desk were friendly and greeted both of us individually, one of them already recognizing the new card holder from the couple of trips he'd already made in the week since getting his card. The front of the library is bright with natural light and the overall feel is that of a significantly beefed-up elementary school library. That's not to say it's particularly kid-oriented, but something about the color scheme and set up gave me flashbacks to my youth. 

Pinney's also in a great location for the Olbrich neighborhood - grab a book and then head around the corner for some frozen custard or down to the park for some reading in the gorgeous gardens."
XXo6JbN_i_WpsXp_C5zPPg,wd3xoNaDLib8dhQ7BxUl6g,"So glad to have a cool space like this in Madison. I haven't taken any classes, but I did attend recently for their Skeleton Circus. The space is huge but manages to still have that warm, friendly, classroom feel despite the sparse decoration and hangar-like appearance. 

For the Skeleton Circus (sixth edition, late show) we were treated to performances using aerial silks, hula hoops, juggling pins, and more. Everyone was passionate about what they do and there was a good sense of community between performers and attendees. 

Being a skeleton circus I didn't expect costumes or high production value, but there are a couple things I would have changed:
- Arrange seats so that everyone can see, maybe running the long way on either side of the performance area? We had seats in the middle of the seating area and I literally couldn't see anything that happened on the floor (balance work, the juggler, the hoopers, etc.), meaning I only saw about half the show. 
- Play music between sets - sitting in the dark and silence was a little awkward. 
- Represent all acts listed in the advertising - I'm a big fan of German wheel and that's what I was most excited for. Unfortunately, there was no German wheel performance.

I'm being picky, though. There were plenty of fun and beautiful performances to keep me happy through the night. I was glad for the more upbeat pieces that had a lot of energy like the  Gorillaz-backed juggler and the group rings piece set to the Black Keys. 

While there, we learned that the structure MCS is located in is being redeveloped, so I'm interested to see where they end up and what their new facility will hold!"

I wanted something sweet...because they make me happy. When I walked into Depanneur Saint-Paul I thought it was a cute little pastry shop. There were delicious treats everywhere and coffee! My two favorites things! I was overwhelmed because I saw so many pastries, candy and sweet things that I wanted to eat. I absolutely love cookies, even though donuts are delicious, cookies are my favorite. I consider a good cookie soft, moist, and fresh. The best kind of cookies are the ones right out of the oven. I know I can't always expect that from a shop. After looking at all the treats I decided on a sugar cookie with cream inside. The lady that worked there described it kind of like an Oreo.

Unfortunately, the cookie was hard as a rock. When I say hard as a rock I mean it was hard to bite into. When the guy first handed me the cookie, I noticed it felt kind of hard so I asked him if he could heat it up. I mentioned that the cookie was hard but he didn't seem to care. I probably should have said this cookie is not acceptable and I don't want it.  Once he handed it to me after he supposedly heated it, I felt obligated to take it. 

I also ordered coffee but when they gave it to me it was cold. I did not order an iced coffee, I ordered a hot coffee, and once again I should've said something. The really kicker is I paid $7 for two things that I just threw out. I'm sure there were a lot of other products that were not this bad however they shouldn't serve cookies that are old, or not fresh. There really is no reason why a cookie should be sold like that, especially when he was aware of it. 

I sure hope they have a lot other things that aren't worth crying over!"

YN58Coh1nvnsNS0FXIeAKg,uKCGOLFVw90woSnY4O4uWQ,"We hired Erin as a full time wedding planner for our event in August, and she ""cut out early"" during our cocktail hour without warning. I'd spent a year working with Erin on our big day, so I was extremely hurt and confused when she left. After all, she had told us while signing the contract that she doesn't do two events in a weekend when she takes on an 'inclusive tier' wedding. As a result, I became the point person for many things at our reception, which is the last thing you want when you hire an experienced professional to do the job. 

We were planning a wedding remotely from San Francisco, and we wanted to hire a great wedding planner. Erin had good reviews, and we chose Erin because she was timely, sweet, and straight forward--all characteristics I related to. She's cheerful and opens up every call with ""hey sweetie"" so it feels like you're in good hands. We only met twice, and both times she would be unable to make a few meetings due to her involvement with the South Asian Bridal Show. It wasn't a big deal for us, but we should have known then that she was spread out too thin. I guess we thought that since we requested so little of her time, that she'd really be there, mind and body on the day-of.

I soon realized that although she was great at email and answering any direct questions, she wasn't going to be the type of wedding planner who'd make sure we had our bases covered. Erin introduced us to some amazing vendors, and for that I'm very thankful. I got my fiancГ© involved once Erin dropped one too many balls, sent one too many wrong/unupdated docs to vendors. We were concerned that that her lack of ownership was beginning to affect our confidence in her abilities on the wedding day itself so my fiancГ© subtly suggested a weekly sync up. It would all be OK as long as she cold deliver on the day of the wedding. 

However she did not. We had a few fiascos at the wedding, but mistakes happen. The wedding began very late, our huppah fell right before the ceremony etc. The only intentional/avoidable incident was Erin's 'cutting out early' as we were about to enter the reception. 

Maybe she thought we were in good hands with her assistant Whitney, but it was extremely unprofessional to leave without warning, and with someone who we'd just met at the rehearsal. Whitney was lovely, but we hired Erin for her expertise and execution, and we would have vetted out and hired a day-of coordinator if that's what we wanted. As soon as Erin left, vendors started coming to me for instruction. The bridal party did not know the logistics of the grand entrance, and one of the groomsmen changed into  a different outfit, and as a result I had to coordinate with the DJ when it came to the shout outs. The DJ came to me multiple times, saying he couldn't spot the videographers etc. and at one point, his eye started twitching because he didn't know the order of things! 

I was hurt by Erin's absence, and the day after the wedding, and Ben and I called her to ask what went wrong, and found out that she'd left to drive to another event. We also let her know that we would be writing a negative review, so she would not be surprised. A few weeks later, when we were no longer thinking about it, Erin sent us a 10 page document that documented everything her team did, all the fires she put out, even aired dirty laundry about vendors she'd blacklisted. While I was not interested in fighting over who's part of the story was right, there was something missing from that doc on a human level. the part that goes 'I'm sorry i chose to leave the wedding we planned together to set up for another one'.

The commitment to the wedding and overall integrity should be important to anyone who plans a wedding. We are not going to harp on all the things that went wrong, but our wedding was mismanaged by Erin, and then delegated without our consent to someone we'd just met.

Unfortunately Tuscano was exactly that, just a sea of beige stucco. The grounds themselves little pretty drab, and for what they were asking for a 1 br - I believe it started around +870 and up.. it was asking way too much for the price.

The place themselves look really standard, like most everything you'll find around Vegas. The location was not fantastic. These are more or less they same cookie cutter apartments you'll find anywhere in Vegas- but you can get a better price."

They always have a beautiful display in the window of unique clothing items and shoes that I would only wear in Las Vegas. 
They had a large selection of faux fur and rhintestone clothing and very blingy shoes.
Not the kind of clothing you would wear to the grocery store.
The prices are a bit high but everything in the casino always have a higher price point.
It's a place I would go if I forgot an outfit at home and I was going out fine dining, clubbing, or going to a high end bar."

There isn't even any signs advertising that you could order some lunch here so it is all word of mouth. 

I have been here multiple times and tried a variety of dishes such as fish and chips, veal sandwich and homemade pastas. They have daily specials and on my most recent visit I had the penne with sausage and red peppers. It was so tasty and the portion kept me full and satisfied. Also, for an added kick, be sure to ask for their chili oil.

N2G99ort9BRFNGcU3gm4xg,fAWMu1hwXBPUS5WvT9uFXA,"In March 2011 Firestone replaced the original muffler on my 1996 Camry. In Feb 2015 Firestone again replaced the muffler. In March 2018 Firestone again replaced the muffler. 

I understand that some after-market parts probably will not last as long as an OEM part. However, the last two muffler replacements done by Firestone lasted only a total of 7 years and 39K miles. The most recent one lasted only 3 years and 15K miles. The original muffler lasted 15 years and 162K miles. This, to me, is unacceptable. It points to Firestone using low-quality parts but charging high-quality prices. 

How do I know this? My local Firestone shops in Monroeville, PA get their parts from Advance Auto. The muffler just installed, which I was charged $372 for, is available from Advance for $132 (after a 30% discount which I was offered online). If I can get it for this price I know Firestone is paying even less. So, we're talking about a mark-up of between 300-400%! For about $60 more than what Firestone charged I could have taken it to Toyota and had a muffler which probably would have outlived the car.

I understand the concept of mark-up on parts and I accept it. However, in this case, I believe Firestone went too far. 

I contacted Firestone numerous times between 3/4/18 and 4/6/18. On or about 3/21, I was finally contacted by phone by a regional manager but ended up in a game of phone tag over the course of a few days so I asked that he email me, which he did. I explained the situation but he never responded."
rRipevyN-e02yOxI_Afoxw,Hv_q_ZnSIoZwdcoH0CyV2Q,"To be completely honest, this is the only college baseball stadium I've ever been to.  Been to plenty of major league parks and a handful of minor league parks, but never a college stadium.

Not sure if it's a normal occurrence, but when I went, the tickets were for general admission.  Which on a non-crowded day is awesome, but could be annoying for a crowded day.  The seats were comfortable enough.  Okay width, okay seat pitch.  Most of the stadium is seats, there were a few bleachers but not many.

Concessions were boring.  The normal hot dog and nachos stuff.

Bathrooms were somewhat clean.

Being that it's Vegas, they could really use an overhang and create some shade.  It wasn't too terrible when I went, but I could imagine it being dreadfully hot during the late spring.

Parking was free and easy."

EaJefde5yMAMKmQ_P3Kr9w,M9MXoSsb193m1g0QmmUYBQ,"We checked this place out for the bubble tea. Although to be accurate, what they offer are bubble smoothies. They are definitely on the pricey side and they don't have a large selection, only four or five flavors.

We've come three times, and every time our drinks have tasted totally different from the last. The only consistent thing is that the employees always seem very confused and don't seem to know exactly what they are doing. It always takes a really long time to get a drink and they are always carefully looking at the instructions to figure out what to do next. 

The first time I came the girl admitted she had never made one before, so I cut her some slack as this was right after the cafe first opened. That time my smoothie turned out very thin and more like a tea, but the bubbles were good. The second time it was way too thick with very little flavor and the bubbles were mushy and gross. The third time the smoothie was way too sweet and the bubbles were hard and gross.

So basically I've given up on trying to get a decent bubble drink from this place...they really need to figure out a recipe and train their employees at some point."

Over the past two years they have made me very happy & let me down greatly. It's been rather a roller coaster ride. It really all depends on what staff is working that day. Some of the staff has sold me tea I'm allergic to even after I asked to make sure it didn't have anything bad in it. Other times I have gotten amazing tea latte's I have loved. It's all over the place for me. I still come to this location because I am a tea addict but I'm very carful about what I order. Go at your own risk! LOL.

rSlRme1T_RRH1ORg_YyVjQ,ez02Jwd6OCpIugu9bgBJMA,"Overall:   I have lived at 618 Gorham for about two years. They have been worst landlords I have experienced in my lifetime. Last year they raised the rent 8% and this year they raised the rent 10%. I was not stupid enough to stick around for a third year, because I am sure they are jacking the rent up again (average is 2.5% for Madison). I guess they would rather keep turning over tenants then keeping people happy. Out of 8 units 6 or 7 have turned over in the two years I have been there. They had to show my place about 30 times before they found someone willing to pay the rent increases. This business model may maximize the amount they can jack up the rent every year, but it really makes for a slummy apartment where nobody stays. Also, they are constantly showing your place, and even going through my closets, so it feels very intrusive. I suppose some of this is unavoidable, but I would much rather find a place that wants me to stay. 

On maintenance:     While the maintenance guys are nice, don't expect any real fixes to happen, because they are not allowed to spend money. Our basement window leaks water when it rains and they guy basically said it was too expensive to fix, so we will just leave it. I have the only apartment without an double door on the front. They said it broke before I moved in and they are no longer installing new ones. There has been a gutter broken (badly) and dropping water two stories and eroding the ground around the foundation. The CHT solution is not to fix the gutter, but to throw rocks and construction waste down to refill the eroded ground. I guess replacing a ten foot run of gutters is too expensive as well. At least they come out quickly, which is good considering the undersized ass drains constantly clog and have to be snaked out. I never had this problem before and my neighbors have the same problem. The maintenance guy says one apartment needs their drains snaked every week. 

In conclusion:    They are slum lords. I suspect that they are planning on tearing down this building or something, because they don't seem to care about keeping the building up. This would also explain why they keep jacking up the rent. They probably want people to move out, so they can rebuild and compete with the new building going up. No doubt they will try to grab my security deposit and I will have to fight for that as well."

It is wonderful to have an opportunity to see contemporary plays performed by local professionals in the beautiful theatres of the Overture Center.

Boasting a core of actors who are also seasoned veterans of (and therefore familiar faces) American Players Theatre in Spring Green, the performances are always terrific.

The opening play of the fifth season, ""Sons of the Prophet"" is an humorous, touching famliy portrait we both enjoyed.

Prior perfromances have always been enjoyed, but some of our favorites have been the ""Sould Food"" monologues, ""The Farnsworth Invention"" (written by Aaron Sorkin!), and ""The Vibrator Play.""

JDHA6f6TYK5yPFsBh_VzDQ,wXi-P691AGOdonMy1TrL7w,"Let me split this into two reviews for the two ""stores"" inside of Jacob. Really, there are three but I don't shop at Jacob Connexion because the clothes are super shoddy and ill fitting. 

Jacob Lingerie: My panty destination. Over the holidays they had 7 pairs for 25 bucks. HELLO adorable cheap panties. I stocked up. They also have super cute and comfy pyjamas. As far as I know, the bras only go up to a C (the last time I checked was like 5 years ago, when I gave up forever on finding a bra at Jacob). I love the way this little part of the store is outfitted, as there is a chance to ogle the panties and consider how comfy the loungewear will be (it will be very comfy).

Jacob (proper): I used to love the clothes at Jacob when I was younger, as they represented professional chic to me. Now I find a lot of it to be kind of boring, but it remains a good place to pick up some basics. The fabrics they use are generally pretty decent, and the clothes are well made. Too bad they don't really fit. At the sign of curves, Jacob's clothing gets weird. I'm talking hips, boobs, everything. My best friend used to work for Jacob, and all of her co-workers agreed about the fit issues. 

That being said, there is still plenty of cute stuff to be found. Take a glance at the fabric before you buy trousers and they should last a loooonnngggg time, which is great. The dresses will not fit if you have boobs, which sucks. But the skirts and tops can be adorable. Everything is priced decently for good workwear. Now if only they could work on fitting hourglass figures."

Be prepared to have your wallet ready as they have these weekend classes if they can suck you into it ($450--hello, sucker!).  They do everything they can think of to get their hands in your wallet and suck you dry I noticed...not appealing at all unless you don't mind getting taken.
I do know they try and put the pressure on you when you sign up to spend and get the ""best"" offer they have, which will cost you a good $2K--and it is probably higher now than that.  I had a friend do it, but I sure would never do that myself as it is not worth the money.

j2PzhhWYgRNZ5ZgOcp7X8Q,2IB0FQDhE122ASrBemIpgA,"Alexis and I have been looking for a replacement for Jewel of the Crown of old.   After many years we have found one.  No - we haven't found it's replacement, we found one that is better; much better!  Here is how the food goes:
The Naan (traditional and garlic) is great!
Aloo Tikki is the best that I have had anywhere!
I am not normally a fan of the Paneer but even I thought it was good.
Chicken Tikka Masala was great!  Normally I am a fan of a much creamer version but I have been converted.  This was so good, we got an order to go for the next day.
Lastly, their Chicken Tikka reminds me of just how good this dish is supposed to be!
We also ordered a side of rice and some ice teas and they also were good.

They make everything from scratch so be prepared to spend 20-30 minutes waiting on the food.  Iced Tea costs $1 per glass so no free refills.  A much better deal than spending $2.75 at other places.

This old adage of ""the hole in the wall family restaurants are the best!"" holds true.   In our opinion, this place is one of the best restaurants and absolutely the best when it comes to Pakistani/Indian cuisine!"

Cactus Wren trail starts at 215 and eastern. It heads south then turns east towards wren city park then over st rose bridge. You can then take St. rose parkway trail or head to amargosa trail.

Totally not what we expected. We thought it would be another Tamales or Mexican cafeteria. But it was more dining. 

We started with the chips, served with two salsas, one creamy red and one green. Neither were too spicy. 

I had the Luis Barragan chile and my bf had the Enchiladas de Chipotle with shredded beef. Maybe another day bf's enchilada would've been good, but today it was eclipsed by my most excellent chile. 

We also shared the orange flan. It was just ... meh. 

The portions weren't too big and the prices weren't exhorbent -- they fit the quality and quantity. 

Or server was sort of friendly and knew his way around the menu. I had problems ordering because every thing looked good. 
The service was a little slow, but I give them a break because they're so new. 

I like that the restaurant was broken up into smaller areas. I don't like to feel lost in a large restaurant. It seemed more intimate and when places get crowed, broken up space helps keep the volume low. 

After eating here, I'm excited to see this place flourish, but I'm skeptical that it will, given its location. 

Oh, yeah, and the logo is really ugly and it really bothers me.

Probably the best selection of Diesel I've seen other than the Diesel store in Shanghai, which was 2 entire floors and its even more amazing sections of accessories, but I digress.

I received phone call from dr.wayne pulver's office today and this rude secretary(Amanda) was asking for $75 payment for dr.pulver's letter which we never received.
She threatened to send the bill over to collection agency and talked to me in very rude manner.
I told her since we received absolutely nothing, I have no obligation to pay at this time.
And she said "" Then we are not sending you anything! ""  
I asked her to provide the proof that she sent the letter like fax confirmation sheet or copy of courier receipt and of course she was not able to prove it. So I asked her to send the copy of the letter by fax or Email this time and she again said"" I told you. We are not sending you anything!"" And she hung up the phone. How rude!!! I can't believe they treat their patient like this over $75?? 
Dr.pulver's medical opinion was not even helpful after all. Three other doctor that we consulted,they ALL said the tooth can not be saved and need to pull out immediately which were totally opposite of Dr.pulver's recommendation!!

I'd classify it as a Yuppie convenience store. There was some great selection of things such as Rao's pasta sauce (love the arribiatta) and stroopwafels. Also all kinds of gourmet chips. Aisles are narrow and product is stuffed to the rafters in this place. A great convenience store is open late and Gardenview is of no exception. You could very well do your grocery shopping here which I'm sure some lazy people or people who live nearby must do. It served the purpose for my visit. A couple of quick items. However an interesting browse.

I explain this as I usually limit myself to once a month to allow me to crave it in between visits.  This location opened up in the fall of 2013 and is a gargantuan sized store.  They specialize in anything Middle Eastern, Lebanese and Mediterranean.  What I think they excel in is many things!  Customer service is excellent and selection and price you can't beat!!  It's probably the cheapest place to come for sandwich meat in Quebec on a consistent basis with a huge variety!  One of my favourite's is the marinated meats!  We have been a fan of the chicken thigh souvlaki, shish taouk and recently I have delved into the lamb!  Also their seafood selection is excellent and price is very very reasonable.  Today they had fresh lobster for $9.99 in the dead of winter!  Try finding that at your IGA.  Their produce section is consistently much cheaper than any IGA, Metro, Maxi and they have much more selection!  

Another few items I usually indulge in are the prepared chicken with rice, the seafood paella (so good and very reasonable) and of course some fresh pita bread and tabouleh salad. Sometimes with some fresh hummus or baba ghanoush!

I now use Dr. Amin not only for my Psoriatic Arthritis issues, I have replaced the Internist I have used for 20 years for Dr. Amin.  I get her utmost attention during my office visit, with detailed follow up calls to check to see how I am doing.

My wife does not use this office as she does not have an Arthritis problem, but Dr. Amin graciously advises me regarding her issues as well.  I am treated as more than a patient by everyone in this office...they treat you like family.  I am very fortunate to be under her excellent care, and would never consider using anyone but her and her associate Dr. Bluestone.

3gY-wkMEuFSJG0DXS_p5aQ,mPzZjWNGDujOJfisOuTOrw,"So... I relocated from Los Angeles to Charlotte a few months ago. I contacted OneProp because it appeared that they were one of the bigger companies in this area. I had no knowledge of Charlotte and relied on their opinions to help me find a nice house in the Ballantyne area to rent. They came through with flying colors and got me into a nice house in a timely manner. That is the good news.

Here is where the bad news starts. Within the first week of moving into this location we started having electrical issues and other issues that affected the livability of this house. It started with a kitchen light that did not work. After sending 4 different electricians to the house, the issue was finally resolved. It only took 4 months to resolve! Also, around the same time, we started having issues with the garage door not opening... after that, we noticed a water stain in the roof that was not there when we moved in. That was another 2 different people coming out to the house and me missing 2 more additional days of work. 

The final straw for me was when 3 electrical outlets in both bathrooms started intermittently not working. My elderly mother had to run an extension cord out of the bathroom in order to get use her hair dryer in the morning. This created a hazard and I was told by OneProp that it would be yet another week and another day off from work to get this issue resolved. At this point I had had enough and told OneProp that i was giving them my 45 day notice to move out due to the NUMEROUS maintenance issues that we were having.

Instead of apologizing for all of the hassle that I went through with these numerous service calls, they notified me that I would have to pay an early termination fee of roughly $3,000 to break the lease that I signed! I told them that i was moving because THEY were breaking their agreement to provide me with a livable location and I could no longer afford to miss more work due to the numerous service calls.

The end result is that OneProp REFUSES to budge on the early termination fee even though THEY are the reason I have to move. I went ahead and paid the fee and will be taking them to small claims court to recover it once all of this is said and done. I have a nasty feeling they will also try to keep my deposit but I'll be fair and update this post when and if they do return it. I really hope that a manager that can do something about this responds to my post and works to make this right. I won't hold my breath."

Now, the location is small. You probably have about 5 feet between the counter and the wall behind you (without counting the rows of tables up against the wall). The area at the very front is open, as in, very few tables and a lot of empty space. So, right off the bat, the lay-out is awful.  

So, this place opened about 2 weeks ago and The Tim Hortons coffee, and food is exactly what you would expect, tasty and good for the soul (for some strange reason). I haven't tried the ice cream section because it's just been way too cold and rainy to be in any ice cream mood.

I asked to speak to the manager and I was told the manager does not work on weekends and I'll get him to call you on Monday, I have yet to receive a call from the manager or anyone else and I am writing this review on Wednesday. After talking to her, I called road side assistance again and they set up a claim and got someone to pick the car up.

RbnkNLPBWDj2qYKPz8KIeA,VyMXcrZC7oinYHaQz7vyWw,"I was relocating to Charlotte from another state over 400 miles away in a very short amount of time and needed a house to rent. A local realtor/property manager gave me access to her site where I saw pictures of a property managed by Craig Dennis (Leading Edge Realty.) I decided I wanted to rent this property. Craig Dennis was unresponsive, which should have been my first clue. I sent emails and called one week prior saying if I didn't hear from him that day, I needed my $1000 deposit back. He finally responded. 

I asked numerous questions prior to moving especially about utilities being on and the house being cleaned. Craig Dennis stated both were true. I told him I would be there on a Friday afternoon/evening to get the keys and do a walk through. When I arrived, the electric was the only utility on. It was then I find out the water heater was gas. He told me both toilets had enough water in the tanks to last me until Monday. After I protested he broke the water company seal and turned on the water. He asked if I had brought pans to heat water so I could take a bath. Um, no, because he never told me in advance that the utilities were off. He previously said that I had 5 days to put the utilities in my name so I had them scheduled for the first business day I was in town, which was Monday. My car was packed with essentials as I wasn't sure when the movers were coming with my things. It was halloween night and the temperature steadily dropped that night and on into the next day. 

When I inspected the house, everything was filthy and nothing was working: the stove quit working after less than an hour of use, there was no dryer hose, the dishwasher didn't work, there was mold growing on the ceiling, the walls were filthy, the only working toilet had feces stuck to it, there was food and filth all over the stove and washer/dryer. 

Prior to coming to Charlotte and on that Friday night, I asked again if Mr. Dennis had a backup as he was VERY hard to get in touch with. He said he would always answer my calls. I called him on Saturday morning to tell him that it was so cold in the house my non-social/skittish cat was under the covers, which she never does. I called again at 11 and his voicemail box was full so I followed up with an email. I told Mr. Dennis everything that was wrong with the house was forcing me to go to a hotel where I could be warm and take a hot shower. 

No response from Mr. Dennis until 3 in the afternoon when the realtor whose portal I used to find the property called and left a message asking why his tenant was in a hotel. Mr. Dennis reluctantly agreed to return funds and void the lease because of all the issues. 

I sent him the hotel bill stating asking him to pay it as it was his fault I was there. No response. I filed a complaint with the BBB where he stated it was my fault for taking his word and not verifying the utilities were on and the house was clean. He also at that time said the property had been empty for a long time, which he NEVER TOLD ME! 

Had Mr. Dennis been upfront and forthcoming about the condition of the house, I would have made other arrangements. The crux fo the issue is he was dishonest and nonresponsive. 

Do not rent anything from this company unless you are just in the mood for dishonesty and non responsiveness and a lot of extra expense and headaches!"
018BsTDbjFjZyWgR0rW_1w,_qkP5rYegUL6N4-cjd2fcA,Do not go to this school. Go to CSN it's a strictly for profit school that'll take all your rights from you and will suck you dry of all your money. I got a job yes but the school is overpriced for the quality of education they give they try to con you into the school and make you take out a bunch of predatory loans. Don't go to this school you'll thank me later.
hxWqksXGHiwz2qINMb7FVQ,q9cEOc8O-zrxH4MPK6yj9A,"Since asking about the security deposit refund, they have stopped responding to my emails or returning my calls. Very unprofessional conduct for a company.  If they had at least kept channels of communication open, I would not have to lower their star rating further.  I have filed a complaint at the Tenant Union in an attempt to recover my deposit.  As I said in my original review, they charged us for a broken window, even though it was noted on the move-in sheet as broken and we have pictures proving it was broken when we moved in.

Update:
The case was moved to Student Legal Services.  Having to go this far to recover a security deposit is completely unacceptable.  I highly recommend you AVOID this company, ESPECIALLY if you are a senior or leaving the area afterwards.  It is possible they tried to charge us for fixing damage we didn't cause because our forwarding addresses  were all out-of-state and they assumed we would be unable to get help from the Tenant Union or Student Legal services."
_E0uYmCuRhPVYRwhssgKGQ,H93EsZIkTfgZ4TjSM_9jUw,"My review is only based on the loafs of bread and I actually bought a sandwich here once.

They have buy one get one Fridays on all their whole loaf of breads and a baguette. The deal is pretty awesome and it normally gets sold out around 3 pm. My favourite is their egg bread with cheese and cranberry orange loaf. For 5.50 you get two loafs of bread. If you have a coworker split it's perfect. If you're on your own it's okay too. Just keep half of each in your office fridge and its food breakfast for next week!

The baguettes are the best deals. Around $2.50 for 2. They're long and fluffy. 

The one time I got a sandwich here was through ritual. Food was not bad also. Fresh and fast pick up. I go here every other friday if I remember."
FEC44uuZ4_FeDYZ-vTCQAg,j57-tOoZZWhEMJ0kzOmJIg,This location is more of a drive through location than anything else. There is no where to sit but if you are waiting to pick someone up at the airport or need a coffee before you head to the airport this is the closest location. The service isn't always the fastest and the staff isn't always the friendliest but they usually get your order right. The people who work they usually will move around a lot so you might start placing your order with 1 person then mid order someone else will come up and and finish the order. This can be confusing from time to time as you want to make sure they get your order right. Overall if you have some time to waste or you are near the airport this is a convenient location.

He told me to come back on may 11-16. He sent me to take x rays., I went to the dr. I didn't know that I was supposed to bring my x rays and I thought that it was like other places where they have it already. I payed for the co pay for 30 dollars and got in the office. The assistant  in there asked me for the x rays  I don't have it I thought they sent it to u guy .She said that they don't do that and the patients have to bring the x rays copies in she told me reschedule for a different day.  I payed the co pay, not even meeting the doctor yet, I asked her could I use that co pay for the next visit in may 18 she told me the next time I see the doctor I don't have to pay for the co pay for another time I go. The third time I saw the doctor, he told me the treatment option will be resection of the enchondroma and bone grafting. But I still need to wait a couple of months to have my finger heal completely. When I checked out I told them that I had payed the co pay last and didn't see the doctor and they said okay. A month later I received the bill for 30 dollar co pay and I called the office to explain it and they told me they will find out, but they still send me the bill. I came to the office three times. I have only saw him two times though. I talked to the manager, they weren't very friendly. I asked her to leave a message for the doctor and she told me the doctor never calls the patients. She said that if I want to see the doctor I would have to pay another thirty dollars! She told me that the doctor have to be payed to see me. What kind of doctor is that? He told me anything you need just ask him. And now when I need to talk to him, they don't pick up and they want me to pay  another thirty dollars. Well that shows that he doesn't care about patients. All about money . Also the office is not organized, they are not friendly and people in the office don't even know what they're doing. I m too tired try to call and explain I called the office to paid my 30 dollar by credit card. They don't know how to do it and hey told me that my card isn't working. Two minutes later I talked to the manager and they did it and it went through. Manager is so unprofessional I have had enough of this. I will have surgery with another doctor that is more compassionate, professional."

U9NeWizXL6V49KElTXW6mA,mvG0wIw0uETSlZWGC5i_7g,"I thought I would try this place out with my girlfriend tonight and I really wanted it to work out because it was a convenient location. Right away I could tell that it was a very cramped environment. It was difficult to navigate around all of the equipment and everything is packed in so tightly that even the bench bars are staggered so maneuvering between them and around all the equipment gets pretty tight. While I did see that some of the equipment was new there was about half of the equipment that was not. This equipment was worn out and cloth was ripping and you can tell that it was on its second or third life. On the seated leg press in particular the seat had fallen away and they had replaced it with a piece of plywood and leather stapled to the wood. The entire free rate rack was completely and visibly dusty with big dust clumps along the length of the rack. There was only one clock on the wall which is an easy fix and I suggest the put another one in the back where the leg machines are. Also, if you want to attract more women clientele, take down the pictures of scantly clad fitness chicks in the back part of the gym. I don't mind cause I'm a dude, but I can see how girls might feel out of place with that up on the walls. Another worn out machine was the bent over leg bicep. When I was working on it, it was so wobbly I though it would fall over. Overall, I was hoping this gym would work out but the weight equipment overall was worn out and it was too cramped."

The main office doesnt respond to emails and hasnt provided any paperwork to me for the moving out process (moving out cleaning list, etc.). There is dog poop everywhere outside and some residents pile tons of bags of garbage out on their patio. There are better maintained apartment complexes available in this area for the same price and cheaper.

z37K7WEXTybpbdX58LnYQg,bduV2PTTGWKIIcPX6gjPrw,"We live at Post Gateway, and it's worked out really well for us so far. I don't really agree that it feels like a college campus. I guess the building is somewhat dorm-like, but it's not a real communal place. At least not fur us; we rarely see our neighbors outside of the parking deck. Which is fine. 

On warm weekend days, there can be a somewhat fratty scene at the pool, which is commonplace in Charlotte. Loud music, beer, generally partying are big on weekends at complex's pools. 

Generally, the management has been reliable; lights are fixed, plumbing issues are dealt with quickly, and they're really on top of their communication. Sometimes on the weekends parties will go late in other apartments, which is annoying from a noise perspective, but people are pretty respectful of neighbors. 

My biggest complaint is that the hallways are pretty drab (like a back stairwell), but the units themselves are really nice. I love the location, too--right near downtown but not really in the mess of it."

cNGVnoA2r-sozn6n9jIuvw,jVOx8dtRQ89fFGsAK-C-cA,"I went into this store at around 4 PM on a week day. I would have expected it to be busy, but I did not expect the frustrating experience I had. There were two cashiers on duty with relatively long lines. The cashier in the line I chose spent fifteen minutes trying to void one single item for a cashier. Twice the other cashier from another line had to leave her long line to assist the cashier in my line. The other cashier left to help her colleague without any apologies to customers in line. At one point the confused cashier left my line, got something from the back of the store, only to ask her colleague again for help in voiding the item. Several attempts were made to get extra cashiers, to no avail. At first customers tried to be patient and two customers actually tried to help the cashier that was having challenges. Eventually, customers went to the back of the store to ask the pharmacist to cash them out. One customer said ""What is going on here?"" and another said ""Can't you find another casher?"" to which the cashier said ""we've called someone but she hasn't come"". Eventually the cashier in my line figured out how to void the customer's item and the customer went on her way. She was the only customer to have been given an apology. Every other customer who spent 15 to 20 minutes in line should have received an apology, but none was offered. The only shoppers drugmart worse than this one, was a store on the Danforth that followed my mother around as if they expected her to steal. That store closed and this Shoppers should close too. I have never seen a more rude, impolite and clueless bunch of staff in my life. I will never ever, return. I know mistakes happen, but my time is just too precious."
IHfbwKQ2CdrsXvagrWP_wA,jVOx8dtRQ89fFGsAK-C-cA,I watched a senior citizen experience very rough care from this doctor. As others highlighted the receptionist is extremely rude.

There was no regard for the fact that maybe this senior hadn't heard her or had slower processing time.
qvgo0I7j_BH_XRMxueO8Ag,Mz56XANYVCPanJlv1RmrsQ,"Well, Lupe lied! I'll give her this, she's a great salesman, but a horrible person for leading people with false promises about this complex. First off, I did not have tile floor like promised. I had crappy linoleum wood. It had patch jobs through the apartment where it had ripped from the previous tenant. When I pointed these concerns out to Lupe, along with my nervousness about the sound from the road, she point blank asked myself and my mother if I still wanted to move in. I had a truck full of my stuff and was clearly ready. I had waited months for this apartment. It was very rude and disrespectful and I was shocked being that I had gotten a different side of her during the initial tour. 

Next, came the issue of the air conditioning. When I did the initial walk through in March I asked Lupe if the air would stay this cool even in the summer, she assured me it would. That was a lie. Come June it was over 83В° in my apartment and I was told I would just have to deal with it, and that is how their system works. I asked for a portable until to be placed in my unit and they stated they did not have any to give me and would not accommodate. I had to file a complaint with the City of Phoenix, have an inspector come out, and only then did I receive a portable unit (funny how they were able to accommodate then). 

Lastly,В are the issues with maintenance. The maintenance supervisor and staff are completly useless and incompetent. They also do not come back to finish work in your unit until you pester management multiple times. Management will originally say, they have not returned based on the priority of other important issues, but then, they never return at all. You have a complex with hundreds of tenants, of course coming to patch the wholes you put in my bathroom will be low on your priority list indefinitely. First maintence cut a hole in my ceiling to try and fix my air conditioning unit and did not return for a month to fix the hole. Then, I asked for the towel rack to be repair bcuz when I moved in it was loose and eventually fell down; they came and put it right back in the same spot, and SURPRISE, It fell down again. I asked them to move it higher or lower since clearly putting it up in the same spot wasnt working and they did, but never came back to patch up the old holes. It stayed that way until I left. When maintence was told to put the portable a/c in my unit, they did not hook it up. When the City of Phoenix ordered them to hook it up, they used wood and duct tape, which fell down instantly and they had to come back again to do it correctly. They didВ it better the next time but still used tape. 

Overall, if you choose to live here, if you have ANY issues, I suggest noting everything in writing. Its your failsafe. I left the second my lease was up, as they wouldnt let me out of it sooner. 

On another note, I had 3 different managers in that 1 year. Priscilla Yazzie walked into a bad relationship between me and the other staff, bbut it she did a GREAT job of making sure to communicate with me and meet my needs. This review is on the complex itself, Lupe, and maintenance.В  Not on Priscilla Yazzie."

Right in downtown Toronto, it's conveniently located by the Queen's Park Subway Station along with a number of coffee shops and restaurants. From the 15th floor, you get a great view of the downtown core; I once saw the sun set from one of the lounging rooms and it was quite beautiful. The staff here are very pleasant and helpful when lost or looking for a patient. Rooms are spacious and the hallways wide, which give in-patients a lot of opportunity to walk around and exercise. There's also a kitchen for patients and their families to use; my friend's mother tells me that the kitchen is stocked with tea and coffee. My friend tells me that the food is pretty good and that the doctors/nurses/other support staff are great ambassadors of PMH. The team are dynamic and work hard to treat the medical needs of their patients in a compassionate and effective way. The only downside (I noticed) was the television situation - in the lounging area, there are a couple of super comfortable sofas with a large screen television. The television, however, only has two channels (and one of them doesn't count): CBC (great Canadian stuff along with 'Corry Street') and the TV Guide channel.

8Gee3ZEsuPcAf24V40c5gw,jIoO7XmjXfgu0pLLkXI_KQ,"Huh, so we're reviewing libraries now? OK, I'm game.

First, this is the Pinney branch - it doesn't say that in the header.

What can I say? Public libraries are awesome and this one is no exception. There are thousands of books, plus magazines, video, audio and even tools (did you know you can check out tools?) all for free. There are plenty of places to sit, tables if you're trying to get work done, and computers for public use. There's also a big meeting room where they hold a nice variety of interesting events. There are several themed book displays around the library, which is nice when I wander in just looking for something, anything, to read. I think my favorite feature, though, is the hold service: you can request any item from any library in roughly half of the state, and it will be delivered to this library in short order. I know, it's a common library service these days, but have you ever stopped to think about how amazingly helpful it really is? And for free!

My only disappointment is that the circulation desk staff are pretty consistently unfriendly. Rarely rude, never incompetent, just very few smiles and no unnecessary words. I hope they like their jobs more than they seem to!

Things I have seen at this library:
- Art work from my kid's school and several other area schools
- Kids knitting

S5OZsKuQhhLSD9aI-FlF5A,RRm52-MtrBRioLwWq4h0Hg,"Where to start? I've been using this vet for several years and never had an issue until last week. I took my Yorkie to get groomed and the groomer had an emergency. My dog stayed in a kennel for 4 hours before I was called to pick up my pet. When I arrived at the location, the office manager was in the other room on the phone. I waited but then she made a phone call, I'm guessing by the conversation it was with the Dr. Then the office phone rang, it was someone she had phoned to ask them to pick their pet up as well because of the groomers absence/leaving early. So she answers the phone tells the customer ""you can bring her tomorrow & the groomer will be happy to groom your dog, yes thank you for understanding the girl I phoned before you (which was ME) was a bitch! 
So obviously I said ""hello.... The bitch is out here waiting patiently for her dog"" so then she says let me go, thank you 

She comes out and says I wasn't talking about you. Now mind you there were only TWO groom spots mine and the girl on the phone. So then I said wow can't believe you would say that to another client.... She said I wasn't talking about you. Goes to get my dog then tells me here's your dog don't come back. I said I will be back to talk to the doctor. She says you're a trouble maker... No compassion you have. 
I said what about compassion for my dog that sat in a kennel 4 hours instead of u calling me when she left at 9 now it's 1230. She says you're a F***** Bitch leave. So I did just that.  

I had an appointment this week November 7 for shots and I phone to check the time and she puts me on hold then says you're no longer welcome here. 
So I went there today November 3 and videoed as I went in, and she said the vet didn't want me there refused to let me get my dogs records as well as threatened to phone the police for harassment.  I would NEVER EVER even if my life depended on it go or refer anyone to this vet office. It's sad because the vet himself, the groomer are actually polite people and good at what they do. But Dr needs to put his business first and get rid of the so called office manager"

Z7lRCPa9MPwFRg18DaOXlg,jA6AgDaFqKXpAdunNMdO1w,"I really hate to leave a bad review, but any bride interested in this venue needs to know what to expect.

The venue itself is beautiful. When the weather is nice, as it was on our wedding day, artificial lighting does not need to be used. I was pleased that our photographer could shoot our ceremony in natural light! The building is old and beautiful.

Cindy, the manager, I found to be difficult to work with. She will not answer the office phone for the chapel. The best way to contact her is through the chapel email address; however, expect to wait a few days for an answer!

I dialogued via email with Cindy in November 2014, hoping to book the place for our March 2015 wedding. Her husband, Steve, who served as our sound technician, was professional and friendly as he showed us the venue when we visited.

I emailed Cindy immediately after visiting and told her I would be sending in my contract immediately, which I posted the next day. My envelope included the check, the contract, and an itemized list of expenses to explain the check amount. We paid to book the place ($400), for the sound technician ($100), and for two extra hours of chapel use ($200).

In January, once I had already sent out the invitations, I emailed Cindy about some wedding decor details (a pew count in particular, so I could buy the appropriate number of bows). She chose to inform me that she had never received my check and contract. I frantically tried to contact her via phone and email, desperate to know if my date was still safe. I spent a sleepless night worrying that I would need to start the venue search over again. I did not hear from her until the following evening; she told me my date was safe and she was searching for my contract. The day after, she emailed me to tell me that my envelope had been in the chapel mailbox the whole time.

Who doesn't check the mailbox for two months, especially when I had emailed her to say it was coming?!?!? 

Also, I emailed her multiple times for a pew count. I ended up visiting again and counting for myself.

In the end, the ceremony went without a hitch. The chapel was opened on time and Steve did a great job with our sound.

After the ceremony, Steve approached my parents for payment. Cindy did not apparently inform her husband that his amount was included in the check (as indicated by my itemized list of expenses included with the check).

In conclusion, fellow brides, be aware of the struggles you are likely to face in communicating with Cindy if you choose this beautiful venue."
rGGAPMFcBf-Z4fotG_MlXQ,1EfpspAQzjKhoyounGImlw,"Service was good price way to high. What is it with these fast food places using cheese dip on burritos, tacos etc instead of real cheese? Bought a burrito  from Jack in the Box 43rd. Ave and Bethany Home Rd. Glendale, Az. 
Kind of costly, not every good, but the kicker was when I took a bite the cheese sauce squirted out, now I have a ruined pair of jeans (new) and a blouse. Went right home treated them to no avail.  That stuff is pure oil, and to me it also  makes the food seem slimy  I and my whole family and friends are boycotting every fast food place that is now using this to cut cost. You would think for almost $5. for a burrito they would at least use real cheese and not fake crap
NO I am not happy, I just got those jeans,  and I did complain to them.
Single star only for service. They were nice and fast."
HBC1Vcv8U-HHPjHeEIynTw,i6ajYsvdMO25y1cw-fQI1g,"Save yourself the headache and frustration and do not rent here. I have complained to management way too many times about the sh*theads above us who do not know what common decency is. They have their kid running and jumping around all day and often do their laundry late at night, sometimes even starting their washer at 2 AM! I hear your kid running and jumping around all day, so why not do it then? Management always states they will talk to these people about it or send them ""final"" notices, but the noise just continues. Other things you will encounter are gates that do not work, dog poop all over the sidewalk, high crime, and empty promises by management. I cannot wait for my lease to end so I can leave this sh*thole apartment.

3EI2uOGYL_YPUh7RMQ5bTg,MUTKPdivWB4OPpnv3STjGA,"A great place to get some footwear, especially branded items. They have a good range of shoes. I don't own a pair of running shoes, so my boyfriend suggested we take a visit to this place, since the price is more affordable even though the items are usually not the latest models (ie: nike shoes). 

The service was great, all the people working there that we encountered were helpful and pleasant. It felt like a great environment. The only drawback was the messy area to try on shoes. It is understandable since there were many customers, but there were just boxes everywhere. Also, they won't always have sizes available. So if you're lucky, you will get your own size.  

We ended up getting a pair of shoes, some socks and two backpacks. I'd consider it a great purchase. Anyone looking to get some shoes/sportswear should give this place a visit!"
Opufpwe4jaf--LtDZ_AHiw,os-sDQoh-hCt2Lg76z6ZUA,"Snack Bar is a newly opened Mexican/Cuban/Salvadorian food place. Its menu consists primarily of foods that you can grab and go for a lunch. GO! I RECOMMEND! We found this place by accident, but it's a hidden gem!

Located across from UNLV (next to Roberto's and behind the 7-Eleven), it's a great new option for students on campus or nearby residents for a place to eat. As a senior at UNLV, I was becoming tired and bored of the same food options and am glad to see a new place that offers some variety. Chipotle and Cafe Rio are in the plazas next to this plaza, but this is definitely a place I recommend people to check out if they want some Hispanic-influenced foods. They have different things on the menu.

 When I went there, there were no customers but soon after I ordered I saw 3-4 people walk in. This guy does everything by himself and he makes the food fresh! Yes -- *FRESH*! This even includes the fresh waters and the smoothie. 

The only thing you have to keep in mind is that because there is only one person working, you may have to wait in line if there is one. However, the owner is extremely nice and you can tell he is a genuine and hard-working guy! He personally told my boyfriend and me that he has no time to advertise because he spends his entire day working at this store. He hands out free food for the homeless people nearby so they will pass out flyers."

The first home was a flip. It looked great and was really well done. Except they missed a lot of mechanical and electrical work, which would have cost us a fortune to have fixed. He was very thorough with his inspection, and that made us feel very informed and comfortable with making a decision on whether to buy a home or not.
I like knowing exactly what is wrong with a house before I buy it, so i don't get a surprise big ticket item later on. Insight made sure that didn't happen and now we are purchasing a great home!
They provided me with a lot of comfort and took a lot of the pressure of buying a home off. I will always use Insight, and I recommend them to all of my friends."

8oOUIbIrscMlf4UOTRn20Q,sKEIclWBwFCYONWhwyZ2-g,"Ok.  So, I'll just say that in terms of places to grab pub style food, this place is actually solid. 

I went recently *FOR LUNCH*  and I got the cheese burger, and while I was craving some onion rings, I went with sweet potato fries because the onion rings were of the frozen variety (though the waiter said they were good, Hm.). Off-topic, but I'd just like to say that at this point I feel to qualify for 3 stars the establishment in question HAS to have sweet potato fries.  This should just be a (Yelp) standard in this day and age, but I digress.

The burger was nice and big, good quality cheeses, and cooked nicely.  Good sweet potato fries, and plenty of them.  It was a good meal for ~$10.

My only criticisms are the choice of burger is pretty limited (only 2 on the menu at lunch that I could see) and it was, on a whole, kind of a boring burger.  Having said that however, I would come back without objection, just not top of my list.  Next time I'll check out the rings.

I should mention that this location is small.  So, during busy times you may not get a seat.  Also, the service was pleasantly abrupt.  Normally I'd be put off by this, but in this case the guy was just too busy to put up with a lot of hmm'ing and haa'ing, so he took care of something and came back.  Plus, this place has the vibe of ""man's man"" eatery so it's all business.  I could see people being put off by it, but it was fine with me.

From the front you'd think it's has more catalogs to show you than furniture but little did I know in addition to the first floor, there's a whole basement area filled with beautiful pieces. 

The lady who greeted me was very warm and asked for my mattress preferences/considerations. She then knew exactly what line/brand best suit my price range and proceeded to explain in detail the different mattress types while allowing me ample time and space to try them all out. In the end, I went home with a beautiful queen, anniversary-edition Sealy's (the upgrade was a pleasant surprise) that had recently been discontinued from the factory line with an amazing price which sat right within my budget. The owner also personally helped the guys move the mattress onto our van. Talk about that extra touch! The last bit of surprise came in the mail the following week.

I love the vintage hat holders and racks from the 60s and all the vintage and retro items, lamps, figurines, clocks, record stands etc etc.

Then to top this all off is the owner herself, very sweet and socially aware Cat.  She is on a rampage to support the arts community, women and the youth in the city.  Going so far as sending cratefuls of furniture and clothing to Africa and offering arts students studio spaces to paint.

I have a small maximum limit on my card but the important thing is that I am finally started some sort of credit line.

2j_zH030dgSUx2p3JtaD7w,lNDoRrMrdrK-Gd8Yllgpkg,"Prologue:
My fiancee and I were on our own for this Thanksgiving Day, so we decided to let somebody else do the cooking, and it turned out be a very good decision.


The Plot:
Their traditional Thanksgiving buffet offered all of the following standard items: Roasted Turkey (including, to my delight, drumsticks and wings - more about that later) with Sage Pan Gravy, Brown Sugar Glazed Ham, Roasted Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Caramelized Onion Stuffing, French Green Bean Casserole with Crispy Onions, Maple and Pecan Glazed Sweet Potatoes, Orange-Cranberry Sauce, House Salad (with Dried Cranberries, Gorgonzola Cheese, Candied Walnuts, Mixed Baby Greens, Balsamic Vinaigrette), and Pies, Tarts, Cakes, and Cookies for dessert.


The Scene:
To put it simply, this was the perfect, traditional Thanksgiving dinner we would all like to have at home without any worries or clean up and more time to enjoy lots of good food.

My portion of turkey consisted almost entirely of two wings. Lots of crispy, crunchy, perfectly seasoned skin along with a few bites of moist, tender meat and I was in turkey heaven. It's true that some of the meat on roasted turkey wings can be dry, but for me it's worth it in exchange for all that crispy, fatty goodness. My fiancee enjoyed more of the turkey breast and she was completely satisfied.

I truly liked the way the sweet potatoes were prepared, which was not mashed as I had expected. Instead, the potoatoes had been cut into cubes with skin on, probably prior to cooking, which added a wonderful texture. That, along with the perfect seasoning, resulted in what was perhaps the best sweet potato dish I've ever tasted.

My fiancee loved everything about the Green Bean Casserole, including the taste and texture of the beans, the consistency of the sauce, and crunchiness and seasoning of the topping.

The Apple Cranberry Tart easily satisfied my over active sweet tooth and the miniature BГ»che de NoГ«l was the perfect conclusion to a truly satisfying holiday meal.


The Rest of the Story:
The dinner was well attended and we ended up being seated in the lobby adjacent to the buffet tables.
Turns out that is was actually a little more roomy and comfortable out there and not too noisy or busy so we were quite content.

The price of $26 per person was well worth it for all of the good food and convenience.


Epilogue:
We happily award 4 stars for a Thanksgiving meal that exceeded our expectations.

awqumQ22UDzwcWNJMEolPw,mzNpsLLRhVzTBzg3SRo-LA,"The app tends to be inconsistent, but always had decent customer service when I had to call in to fix or confirm something, and the staff that works at the physical locations has always been great.  I admit- I was a strong proponent for this service for a while.  William Hill was my preferred betting site online, as well as in person.  
That is no longer the case.  
At some point over one particular random night in January 2016, my account became ""banned by upper management.""  When I called to get an explanation, I was given to their Mobile Ops Manager, a particularly disagreeable individual named David L.  What amounted to being a simple case of mistaken identity (they had me confused with someone else) which should have been rectified, including an apology, ended with them basically accusing me of being a criminal and that they've decided not to do business with me.  Whatever the information/security breach was- it was on their end (something they are not allowed to admit to, it seems).  I was willing to provide any information necessary to clear up the situation.  Did they put any effort into resolving any confusion? No.  Was I treated in a polite & professional way? No.
The manner in which I was handled by someone in an upper management position was reprehensible.  As a Las Vegas local, there are literally dozens and dozens of competitors I can give my business to, but my real intention moving forward is to ward off anyone I know, or will come to know, from giving a penny to William Hill. I probably would have been a customer for life, but after the way I was spoken to, they don't deserve a moment more of my time."

This is a great place for little Japanese trinkets, kitchenware, and textiles. They have a nice selection of both traditional and more modern Japanese things -- tea sets, chopsticks, stationary, kimonos, woodblock prints, staple-less staplers... Prices are not cheap, but the stuff is beautiful, authentic and shipped from Japan. A great place to hunt for gifts this time of year, and they have slightly extended hours for the holidays (until 7pm on weeknights)."

UQGFKqELX9_RMRxqw6MFDw,Ry1O_KXZHGRI8g5zBR3IcQ,"Purely from a person that doesn't play golf regularly, I'm a fan of this golf course.  It's been around for a while and probably has changed management hands over the years, but it seems like a really decent place to play - Some people say the course is pretty challenging with all the par 5 holes here, but its not an open lynx course where my ball usually ends up on another hole and other golfers are in danger of being hit by me.

I'm also familiar with the course since my family holds an annual golf tournament here in remembrance of my late father (who was an avid golfer).   Most of his friends and friend of friends come and play... have a good day.. and also raise money for my dad's high school back in the Philippines.  The funds create a scholarship for those kids that were not able to finish high school due to their family situation (they have to work...) so the moneys raised by the tournament allows them to go to school in the evenings and complete their educations.

The staff here is super friendly and nice - even more so due to this crazy even we hold here and they definitely are very accommodating in making the golf tournament happen.

The clubhouse is pretty standard... small golf shop in the front... and a bar/dining area in the back.  Driving range, putting green, and chipping area are all near the clubhouse and the cart is included in your golf outing and green fees."

A hesitant ""yes...?"" later, we were standing in front of the salad bar, but only after she had said ""I know it sounds really weird, but this convenience store has great sandwiches and salads... just trust me.""

She wasn't kidding. This place is:
a) confusing
b) questionable on the outside
c) a convenience store
d) delicious
e) all of the above

Actually kind of reminds me of the sandwich box. The sandwich setup is very similar -- you get to pick what goes on your sandwich out of a list of meats and vegetables. We both went for the salad bar, which is self-serve pay-by-weight with an impressive spread of offerings: fresh spinach, arugula, and greens; huge marinated mushroom slices, cooked broccoli, and large chunky slices of creamy avocado; grilled chicken strips, seasoned tofu, edamame, and corn...

Can you believe that salad was so filling I couldn't even finish it? Wonderful find, with the heart-warming moral of trusting your friends."

It's the sort of place where you see something cute that you want and you think ""I can actually afford this!""  A rare treat.  They were also offering tastings of their sparkling wines, which was really fun.  $1 got me a little mini-glass of bubbly, and they had some strawberries, chocolate, crackers, and cheese for snacking as well!  I bought two bottles of inexpensive wine that were recommended by the owners.

Next time I'm in Cleveland, I'd love to go back to Tremont and return to this store.  It's a really pleasant place to be, and I think there are some great, affordable finds - both for wine and home decor.  Also - they have an adorable dog!  Even more reason to check it out!"
qCsxrmnqA5o1djIwnauG4g,SlgpAnj2gQd44EM_Uq6DkQ,"This was a first year event as a finale to Charlotte Craft Beer Week.  The event was held at Silver Hammer Studios, the same location as this year's Queen City Brewers Fest.

The event featured regional breweries from Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and a few others mixed in there.  Missing were some of the Charlotte favorites like NoDa, Triple C, OMB, and Birdsong with their own spaces but Duckworth's (the only non-brewery represented) had a few of these on tap.

My favorite beer of the day came from Wicked Weed from Asheville with their French Toast Stout.  

There was a large section for home brewers and they had food for sale from 3 food vendors. There was also entertainment in the form of carnival type acts - jugglers, belly dancers, rope performers, magicians stilt walkers, etc.  

Aside from this festival being sponsored by Goose Island which many may not know is owned by InBev/Anheuser Busch and is no longer what I would consider craft beer, this was a decent festival.  I hope next year they invite more of the local breweries to participate.  Why call it Charlotte Craft Beer week if you exclude the locals?"

Springbank is a local (Alberta) cheese farm with several retail locations around Calgary.  3rd Generation cheese farmers that first started in 1960 have gotten their craft down to an art. 

The shop in Crowfoot is a large shop with everything you could need from the cutting boards, knives, flavored crackers and chips, flavored jellies and of course, the cheese.  They sell all of their own Springbank cheese, and other cheeses from around Canada, and the world.  

Prices are reasonable, ranging from moderate for their own Springbank cheeses, to high for the imported cheese.

Staff is very friendly, often offering up samples of cheese with information of where it came from and how it's made."

There didn't seem to be anyone working there, but then a mirror/door opened on the back wall, revealing what appeared to be a private cigar club (I want in!)  I believe it was the owner who came out to greet me.  He was very nice and helped me choose some cigars for a special occasion I was preparing for.

What I immediately did not like about this market is that it is situated in the parking lot, so everything is on asphalt. I imagine it could get uncomfortable pretty quickly in the Summer months. Right now, it isn't bad.

This is a very small market, and I would not say it is a ""farmers"" market because most of the stands do not represent farmers. There is one main-stay stand that has organic fruits and veggies, but apart from that one, the other stands are all crafts, hot sauces, and snack foods.

Like most ""farmers"" markets in Vegas, this is not going to impress you if you've been to other larger markets in places like California.

It isn't bad. It's worth a gander if you have nothing better to do."

Lamp was missing the turn on switch. Dresser drawers don't slide right.

Don't be put off by the fact that they're in a gas station - they have a cute little seating area if you want to stay.  The drive through was busy but there wasn't anyone in line inside. There were several employees bustling around behind the counter but each one was very friendly.  I'm impressed by how they work in such a small space.  

They have quite a large menu for being a smaller operation; lots of smoothies and coffee drinks.  We ordered 4 breakfast sandwiches, two scones and a caramel macchiato.  I was really impressed with the drink, it was the perfect amount of sweet.  It take a long time to get the breakfast sandwiches but you could tell they were swamped.  Unfortunately we realized we were shorted two sandwiches when we arrive at our destination so we only got to try the egg white sandwich, blueberry lemon scone and apple crumble scone.  All were delicious, but we agreed that the sandwich wasn't worth the $5.  The meat seemed chewy and there wasn't a lot of flavor.  

We returned on our way back through town and before I could even mention that we were shorted two sandwiches, one of the girls at the counter recognized me and offered to rectify the situation.  We were credited our money immediately, which was appreciated.  

Will definitely try this place again."

Didn't find this out until months later when I received a bill from the medical supply place.  When I called AZ S&J they explained that they ALWAYS use Laguna Medical.  Huh?

A last minute chiropractic appointment for a migraine brought me here and the incredible service and people keep me coming back.  Dr. Q is an amazing chiropractor and kind friend.  When I started seeing him I was having horrible tension migraines at least every week or two.  After just a month of treatment I wasn't having migraines at all.  I continue to see him because he is fun, concerned, and very talented at what he does.  I come in, tell him what's been feeling funky, and he fixes it.  Simple as that. He has come in early, late, after-hours, etc. to make sure that I'm not in pain.  The peace of mind I have from knowing how much he cares is priceless.  He is awesome. :)

I also see Carla for massage and she rocks.  I am thankful that I took a chance on Carla as she has a very soft-spoken personality and truly listens to what is going on with your body.  She checks in often on pressure and follows closely with your amount of dialogue...if you're talkative, she's talkative, if you just need some silence, she only speaks when spoken to.  She's become an all around wonderful friend.  Ashley is also a total rockstar.  If you want very deep tissue work combined with some serious stretching, she's your girl.  Like everyone at Custom, she is just a very sweet kind soul and she does her best to make sure you feel your best.      

In general, the office is beautiful, located close to my work and full of the nicest people.  Shelby and Nikki, the front desk girls, are so pleasant. They're the type of gals that remember your name and do what they can do make sure you get taken care of in the best way possible.  As a former spa receptionist, I appreciate all that they do.  Actually, my first appointment happened because Shelby went out of her way to see if Dr. Q could stay late and help me with my horrible migraine.   

Anyway, if it's not obvious...I am truly thankful for all the people here. Like I said, I'm a total Custom Chiropractic groupie and I think you should be too. :)

Ps. Some cherries on top are that they always have cookies and other snacks out that are delish!"

However, I suggest that if you're a beginner or a new rider at Rocket Cycle to please ask for help when adjusting the bike on your first visit to maximize your riding experience. I've had my shins injured before from a cycling class at a different studio due to the lack of awareness, leaving me with scars. You wouldn't want to injure yourself as you slip off your bike half way through class, or to even stop because it's rubbing you the wrong way. Safety is a part of having fun!"
tDXCckzWdOhz5gwV_REYOQ,B3B4FRlf85v7gEhTmfMihw,"I got a late lunch here in March. It was 2 pm on a Saturday and the place was empty; only one person was working, but he was great and service was good.

The lunch specials are inexpensive ($9-13) and come with rice, soup, and salad. Everything was tasty and made well, although I would have liked a bit more spice in the black bean sauce which the menu warned was spicy.  The hot and sour soup was the real firecracker, gooey and vinegary and full of chili flakes.

Portions are satisfying without being huge. You could come here for lunch and go back to work without falling asleep in a food coma at your desk.

Dinner prices are higher -- menu items seemed to range from $15-$25.

Not wheelchair-accessible -- you have to go up a step and turn 90Вє to get in, and the washrooms are in the (oddly dark and clubbish) basement.

A solid three stars and a bit more. Minus points for the lack of accessibility and plus points for a tasty fried banana dessert."

A huge karting track on one side and an RC dirt track on another and all the hobby needs that I could ever want. Arcades around the perimeter and when I'm hungry I can go over and get some food to eat. The kart track is definitely the showcase of the facility. Its high-tech with barricades that came in from Italy! Can you believe that? HobbyTown staff is definitely most knowledgeable in the town. They know everything there is to know about all hobbies. RC airplanes and cars to models and rockets. Your customer service is top notch. And they cater to both the novice and professional. They host some of the biggest RC car races in the country. They are such a great addition to the local Phoenix economy. Thanks for coming guys.

I should have as always done it through tasteaway.com and gotten the extra 20% they were offering but mainly because when i was given sh.t food I had some recourse.  Min delivery $30 AND a $4 delivery charge.   Don't expect too much and you might be fine.  Prices are pretty good for a lot of items but some are ridiculous like chaat papdi was a rip off price-wise but to top it up the dish itself was horriiiibbbbllleee and not even papdi as it is supposed to be.  I found this place to be very unprofessional and would go there under desperate conditions only.  Mithai was pretty good.  Parathas were awful.  Naan- awful (again not what is is supposed to be at all).  The overall taste is authentic which is a good thing, so when desperate for cheap Indian food I might still order here.  I think once you figure out some of their good items, you might be okay."

It is apparent just talking to him that he is really honest, but it's also obvious by the fact that he offers the best options even if it involves sending someone to other specialists instead (I find this is rare) and also he has not charged me consultation fee - which tends to be $183 - either because he saw that I needed to still go to other specialists having gone to one before him as well or because he did my root canal but that was 8 years back !
He takes his time like no other specialist.

I highly recommend him."

Since it's March we painted shamrocks - but they had a ton of colors so you were able to paint what ever you wanted.  Included in the price were 6 samples and a souvenir glass you got to keep.  Gave us a chance to taste all the different flavors they offered (we had 5 people so we got a decent array).  Plus, the owners were walking around getting us the samples so we could focus on painting and didn't need to constantly get up and refill our drinks.  I ended up buying a bottle of the cranberry chianti, but many of the flavors were delicious.  I would definitely recommend spending an evening here and taking home a bottle or two."

Does this sound like somewhere you want to live and pay $550-$600+ a month to live? Think this is compliant with the Fair Housing Act or up to code standards for the City of Phoenix/Health Dep?

The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because I had a business, a life, and other things going on to where I tried to put up with the worst and make the best of things.

But listen, there is just no doing that here if you're a professional, a student who needs to study, or anyone who isn't gone all the time.

If you're there and need to do anything of value or have anything of value, it isn't going to work. Look somewhere else. Unless you're ""urban"" or ""you about that life"" if you know what I mean (for the sake of political correctness), then you're not going to be happy here if you have standards, class, or a life that doesn't consist of messing with the happiness and well-being of those of us who want to actually enjoy things and be productive.

People need to know the truth (this) before they move in and lease."

Tl0_JsPz8B3I-opvSZXRGg,KqlSgw3Xx7H1tNyopV3GGw,"Do yourself a favor and come try this place. The food is delicious and the staff is extremely friendly.

This is why you NEED to come and visit this place:
1) The food is delicious. Everything always taste very fresh and home made. The clam chowder soup (served on friday's) is one of my favorite things to order. My salads are never wilty, my bread is never hard. Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!
2) The interior is very cool. The art on the walls are great and compliment the ""music"" theme throughout the shop. Plus, all the sandwiches and salads are named after famous songs (i.e. piano man, bohemian rhapsody, the boss) and the menu is designed to look like the lettering from the albums. It allows someone to appreciate all the time and effort put into all the extra details in creating this place.  And, they play awesome music all day that you can jam out to while you eat.
3) This place is conveniently located right down the street from ASU, so you can pick up your food on your way to class or on your way back.

And in regards to the other review, who complained about paying $7 to $8 bucks for a sandwich, is ignorant because that is about the standard price for a fresh sandwich. Any fresh quality place, like Paradise, AJ's, Sprouts, you're going to be paying in that price range for that kind of quality. However if you're wanting to only pay $5 for a sandwich that has hormone injected deli meat and GMO infested veggies, go to Subway or stick with your carne asada burritos and chicken wings. Gross.

But... if you love fresh quality food, fair prices, personable staff and good music, come check this place out!

Ps. try an Iced Toddy with white mocha :)"
4VB-AmekvX3SXk2I2qVn6Q,TaMcyPWOZ1L8odTq0p7srg,"Wow! What a terrible experience! PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON BUYING AN AUTOGRAPH FROM THEM:

Piece of The Past is an online autograph auction service that deals in classic and contemporary signatures. As an avid autograph collector I have been looking for a site like this since the trustworthiness of eBay for autographs is murky at best. I joined a few months ago and began bidding and buying items immediately. My first purchase went very smoothly. When I received my invoice I was in Las Vegas and saw that their storefront wasn't far away. I contacted them and asked that to save time and shipping costs, could I stop by and pay for it/pick it up in person. I spoke with a nice young man named Matt and he handled my first transaction at the store very well.

For the next few months I purchased items in nearly every auction set they posted (some weekly, some bi-weekly). I was spending hundred of dollars with them. Over time I have called them to discuss invoices and shipping arrangements and every time I've dealt with anyone except Matt, they've been rude and abrasive. I was somewhat put off by the treatment but still enjoyed the autographs I was acquiring so I let it go.

A few weeks ago I won an autographed photo and it arrived damaged. All four corners were bent, there were indentations, small rips and a large crease down the left side. It was entirely unacceptable. The obvious reason for the damage was poor packing. The cardboard inserted into the large envelope wasn't nearly big enough or strong enough for the photo. I sent a very respectful and businesslike email requesting a new autograph if they had a duplicate or a refund/credit on a future item. One whole week went by without response and I found myself in Las Vegas again (with autograph in hand so I could take it in and address my issues in person).

Just a few hours before I was planning on taking the item into their storefront I received a very rude response from the ""CEO"" of the company Kevin Martin saying he wouldn't take responsibility and it was the post office's fault. I called the store to further inquire about the rude email and the person on the phone began yelling at me. I hung up and decided to wait until I get to the store and try to talk to Matt. Within minutes I receive another email from Kevin Martin (who I was told was out of town but seemed remarkably up to the minute in touch with the issue) telling me that unless I give his employees a formal apology I will be blacklisted from his site.

At this point I am just floored. A business is asking one of it's loyal clients to apologize for something they aren't responsible for?!

I went to the storefront to find it locked although they were obviously open. I knocked on the window and Matt came out to talk to me. I laid everything out and he very amicably resolved the situation. I reminded him that I've already spend hundreds with his company and that in the future I would most likely be spending thousands of dollars more. I also told him that at this time I am very upset with the way I was treated and would like to withdraw my current bids (especially since Kevin Martin has ""blacklisted"" me at this point and frozen my upstanding account). Matt apologized for the issues and left things on somewhat good terms. I decided that I would take some time then consider giving them my business again.

Then... approximately 10 minutes out from the store I receive another email from Kevin Martin (who was obviously at the store the whole time) criticizing me, calling me rude and attacking me as a person.

Having the straw that broke the camel's back sent directly to my gmail account I did a quick Google search and discovered scores of people who have had Kevin Martin attack them as well over relatively minor service issues. I have also found numerous claims of forgeries being sold through Piece of The Past so I don't know what I'm going to do now. I'm going to have to go through all the pieces I purchased from them and have them authenticated.

It's such a sad thing that this man ruined a good client-business relationship over a few dollars but consumers deserve to be treated better than this.

I rarely write negative reviews but I once again say: BEWARE! These people are dishonest, rude and will leave you in a state of utter shock at the way you were treated."

apuq9eTHlFE1etrdND0R3g,jNsPTMmg9EcqY7q2Q-Rm6A,"This is a new store inside Fashion Show Mall, across from Guess if I remember correctly. While shopping around, I noticed this store and thought, ""great! i can probably find a dress to go out in at this store."" After walking into the store, I already found a dress I fell in love with - a turquoise silk halter dress with a gold koi fish print. 

The store itself is pretty small, but has a good selection of dresses, tops, pants, and also menswear specifically for going out. They also have a large screen tv and had a Tiesto in concert DVD playing, pretty neat.

I am giving the store three stars not based on their clothing selection, but the service and some other aspects I noticed. The girls working at the store were very helpful with what I needed, but were also very pushy. After entering the store and finding the first dress, and having them put it in the dressing room for me, I told one of the girls that I wanted to continue looking around. While I was trying to do this, she kept grabbing other dresses and bringing them to me asking me if I liked them. It was nice of her, but she was doing it in a very pushy way. After I tried on the dress, I was getting ready to leave the store, and the same girl asked me if I was going to buy it, and I told her I wanted to look around more. But she kept pushing me, and asking me why don't you buy it now? You're not going to find anything else around the mall. 

So after that, I left the store pretty annoyed. Needless to say, I did go back and buy the dress since I liked it a lot. One other thing that bothered me was the fact that none of the clothes in the store had price tags. So basically, the staff could have been giving me any bullsh*t price if they wanted to. The girl told me it was $50 and that it was actually a special price during their opening week. I figured $50 sounded about right, maybe a little higher than it should have. But still, they need to get some price tags on their clothes."

X7xBmi1DLl1B_JvA3dwrAw,eWyhZ-114SqkZkG0RyJG9A,"I wanted to try eyelash extensions again for an upcoming trip, but I wasnt very happy with my last experience getting them done. While looking for somewhere new, I came across Lashious - I had driven by before and was a bit skeptical, but I'm very glad I gave it a try! I'm in LOVE with my new lashes!

The spa is located on 14th Street, and offers ample parking in the back (huge plus). Upon entering, I walked downstairs into the cozy space and was greeted by soothing music and the unmistakeable spa lavender scent. There didn't seem to be any other clients there, and the place was quite small - a room for lashes, another room for massages/acupunture, along with a small restroom and coffee station. However, it was extremely clean and well set up for the small space. While I filled out a consent form, I was offered tea or water and eventually led into the room. What I liked about Lashious vs. other places I have gone to for extensions, was that there was an actual spa bed as opposed to a chair you had to lean your head back in, which can get extremely uncomfortable during the procedure.

Tania started working on my lashes right away (no relation to the Tania MediSpa next door - phew!) and I was instantly relaxed. She is extremely talented and experienced, not to mention friendly and professional. While receiving my service, the massage therapist gave me a 5-point pressure massage with the oil of my choosing on my legs and feet (an extra $20). Nice touch! The massage itself wasn't great, but I was given a warm fuzzy blanket afterwards and promptly fell asleep during the 2 hours it took to apply the lashes. I was told that they use Lavish products exclusively, and although the procedure itself was extremely gentle, I did have some slight stinging from the glue afterwards, which subsided about 30 minutes later. Nothing major, I was able to drive home without a problem. I was also informed that they do cupping (along with the acupuncture), which I'm very interested in trying out.

Since getting my lashes done, I have lost approximately 5 - fantastic for almost a week of having them (while on vacation!). They are a lot thicker than the last place I went to, because at Lashious I actually had a choice in what style I wanted (unlike the last place which shall remain nameless). I ended up choosing the silk lashes, the curl is perfect and you can tell that they're good quality. I absolutely love the end result! Their prices are on par with other lash studios in the city and the service is great - no gossiping or gum chewing here. I would absolutely recommend Lashious - they have some fantastic promotions for new clients. I plan to return very soon to maintain my new look!"

I hired him almost immediately after his quote came in extremely fair (and of course below hiring a general contractor).  They built two niches, a bench, and installed tile, thinset, and grout for a master shower remodel.  The project was completed in 5 days as promised and actually started 3 weeks ahead of schedule due to another one of his jobs being delayed.  Vicente's installers were very respectful of my home, placed canvas liners to protect my floors all the way from the garage door to the shower itself.  They played some music while they worked but kept the volume so low I couldn't hear it unless I was in the master bedroom.  They cleaned up at the end of each day and Vicente checked in on their work regularly.  I am so pleased with the work they did, Vicente's communication and management, and the price I paid."

3FsO5T0X57pAbixNkcyvxg,6Tltkugod2LXqoQsmUwyag,"Want to bring back fond memories of ice cream parlor trips you took as a kid to places like Farrells or create new fond memories for your kids? Here's your ice cream paradise.

In fact, Guinness just recognized them for having the biggest ice cream menu in the world, and that's quickly evident when you open up the large-sized menu to see 150 different ice cream dishes to choose from. 

All are on the creative side, including ice cream dishes made to resemble bacon and eggs and sushi. Also have a kids menu and, most importantly, several low-calorie and sugar-free selections.

But forget the specifics... How's the ambiance and, of course, how's the ice cream.

For the parlor itself, think of Farrells in the 21st century. There's a player-piano, though this one runs off digital files, and a plasma screen flashing charactures of the various flavors. Most impressive thing about the room is its size and layout that is very conducive to big groups and parties. 

Unfortunately, the night my son and I took in was a weeknight and there were so few people inside that each of us could have had 31 flavors each of the 150-item menu to ourselves. Hopefully this isn't a bad sign for the place, as they're deserving of patronage, though I figure business kicks up on the weekends.

Now as for the ice cream, I'm not going to say it's the best I've ever had... But the creativity of the dishes boosts the fun factor into five-star territory.

I had the Banana Scoopreme... Great mix of strawberry, chocolate and vanilla ice cream layered on top of a banana with crushed pineapple. Just great. 

Son had the Spiderboy, which was strawberry sprinkled with red sugar crystals and gummy worms forming the legs. He loved it, especially getting a kick out of the worms. 

We're planning on making the place a weekly stop after soccer practice.

12-08 UPDATE: Alas, Ice Cream Overlord has closed its doors. Can they at least bring Farrell's back?"

N2NgijnhDThp-EixO9BfKw,6x0A6Ia6HsuIvUOveu_N-w,High quality food. Resembles home cooked food. Philly cheese steak is amazing. They do a lot of catering they tell me. People are super nice and not stingy. Even their plastic containers and knives and forks are nicer sturdier quality too. Highly recommended.

Something has happened! Something has happened!

I have never seen any place take a dive this fast and this is coming from a man has seen The Hunt for Red October a million-zillion times.

So I was cooling out, maxin and relaxin and I thought ""I am going to go and get my Aroma's on"".   I rolled up, check my shades and entered the establishment. The sweet and mousy waitress from my first few visits was there and I knew something was up from the moment that I walked in.  She had the thousand yard stare, she looked right through me.  Since my last visit she must have seen things that would ruin even the most hardened of people.  McCain, that pussy, he ain't got shit on this girl. She knows pain. What could have happened?  She took my order and charged my card.  Then I waited, and I waited some more. Then just when I thought that I was done waiting, I waited some more. It took a full thirty minutes to get my takeout order.  I would have said something. But what do you say to someone who is clearly on the edge?

My food finally comes.
I leave.
I get home.
I put on the Daily Show.
I open the container.  
My chicken curry contains exactly 3 pieces of chicken.  

Monkey Balls!  What?  It took them 30 minutes to cook 3 chicken nuggets in a Curry Sauce? 

Dive! Dive! Dive!

Then I ate the little tiny pieces of meat. I realized then that they were mostly bone and not a big bone that you could actually separate the meat from.  It almost seemed as if they actually cracked chicken bones up into splinters and then jammed them into the meat.  It was like an Indian version of the ol' razor in the apple trick. I took a bite and chewed and right before I swallowed I felt the knife like bone get stuck in my throat. I panicked, ""Oh no! Chicken bones are bad for dogs, Therefore, they must be horrible for humans!"" I start to really panic. I cough, I drink, I swallow,  and I jam my fingers down my throat.  This is how I am going to die, watching The Daily Show and choking to death on a chicken bone.

I soon regained my composure and got over the chicken bone. I managed to choke it down, literaly.  It  is currently making its way through my digestive system, and I  hope no update will follow.  

Just then the sweats hit me.  This food hit my gut and made it feel like a bunch of hippies had eaten the brown acid and then were dancing around in my stomach and on top of my soul.   I truly felt horrible.
I curled up in bed and attempted to sleep on the evil that had invade my body.  The good news is that I lived to write this review.  The bad news is that there is a rogue chicken bone lose inside my body.

Aroma's what happened? You used to be so good.  You used to make me happy on the inside.  I fear you are in your death throws.  I wonder what little restaurant you will become next."

The burger is always cooked to your exact liking and you choose the type of cheese you would prefer. I love the swiss. It is served with a generous serving of sweet potato fries or regular fries. The salad is always fresh and the NY Cheesecake is delicious. Today there was a beautiful breeze and it was not so warm so we sat on the patio and enjoyed the fountain view."

We had wood floors and tile put in our house which included a fair amount of work on the floor/toe boards and repainting. The floor boards do not look great, but not horrible. The paint job is TERRIBLE. It looks worse than before and we requested that they re-do the painting and it was never done to satisfaction. At this point, we don't even want the contractors in our home anymore and would rather pay someone else. The project was also supposed to take 3 weeks and it ended up expanding to 2.5 months."

It turns out I didn't need the space. About 7-8 days later I removed my lock, it only took a few minutes to process the check-out. Everything was very easy from start to finish. No complications, no hidden fees. The property is very clean, including the on-site restrooms which is important with a toddler!, well placed security cameras and you have to enter a code to get in as well as get out of the gate.

I waited roughly 4-5 mins in a parking spot which I didn't mind at all if that meant my food would be super fresh. When I got home, (I live across the street literally) all of the food was cold.

0M4fn7ib4zJF6CF0XPLSfg,TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,"I've been an Allstate customer since the 90s, and Regan and Ginger have been the best Allstate agents I've had. I am basing my review mostly on the service I've had with them since my move to Vegas in 09. When I moved to Vegas, Ginger took great care of getting me set up with Nevada insurance, DMV and smog check info. It was reassuring to have an agent who looked out for me when I was moving from IL to NV, she was very knowledgeable and responded very quickly. 

Regan is a great agent - I really like him and would refer him to anyone. He is very personable, professional, and calls you back in a timely manner. A bit of advice for those who call this agency about their policy -- I recommend only talking to Regan or leaving a message for him. The woman who answers the phone there is not the most polite or customer-service oriented person. I called earlier this month to inquire about my rate increase and she was short with me. Maybe she was having a bad day, but I would avoid her and just deal with Regan. 

Unfortunately, Allstate has nationally raised their rates the last two years, forcing me to shop around and I just switched to State Farm this month. Minus one star from this review for the recent rate hike. Last year my auto policy went up $17 a month, and then AGAIN this year's policy renewal stated my rates significantly increased another $19 a month, from $134 to $153 a month for a 10 year old car that I own. I was in their their ""Safe Drivers Program"" accident-free, no claims, and with excellent credit, and yet my rates went up. Preposterous. I wouldn't let this deter anyone from calling for a quote though, as you never know if their rates may end up being more competitive.  

I also appreciate the courtesy call I received from Regan after I cancelled my policy. He wanted to know, of course, why they lost the business (I am sure he was not surprised as to my reason) and it was nice to know that some businesses still care enough to call their long-term customers to say they are sorry to see you go. I am sure they say that to everyone, but I wasn't really expecting a phone call. Even though I can't justify staying with Allstate for obvious financial reasons, I will say if you are looking for a new agent I would encourage you to give Regan a call."

Yonge street - uptown - seemed the ideal spot to find a middle aged, upper-middle class woman a mid-sized table cloth.  Au Lit is a linen store whose French countryside faГ§ade in the front of the store was always very attractive to my eye.  The store, much like its merchandise, was very white, clean and luxurious feeling and if it wasn't for the unbelievably snobby staff, who would not even look at me when I walked through the door, I would have been happy to purchase one of their over-priced items for my deserving mother.    

Instead of having an enjoyable shopping experience, I left the store empty handed, feeling rather persecuted (ala Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman) and wondering if it really was wrong to go out shopping in my gym clothes."

Ted does an amazing job and I never want to have to take my horns to anyone else. I got both my CC and F hand finished/maintenanced by Ted before going to grad school and they both feel wonderful! Plus, you always learn something new during drop off, so it's like a free music history lesson every time you get your horn serviced! They also have a wide variety of accessories in stock, from six or seven types of valve oil to silver polish to mouthpieces, if you don't find something in store, they're happy to order things for you. Often, if you're around the main counter someone will ask if you need help with anything, but if you look determined or head straight to the music section they assume you know what you're doing/where to look. I kind of appreciate that instead of constantly being hounded with ""can I help you with something?"" this doesn't mean however, that they aren't happy to help!

I went to another tire shop who told me I needed to go and ask for my money back because it was illegal for them to sell me a tire like that. When I went to ask for my money back the manager and employees were very rude and unprofessional and only offered to replace the tire which I didn't need anymore because the other shop gave me one almost brand new for cheaper than what they gave me!!

The reason behind the 3 star rating is really a pet peeve of mine.  I do not like to see any kind of cleaning products.  It doesn't matter if they are capped or underneath a cabinet behind the front, if it's in eyeshot then I'm turned off by it.  Keep them in a closed cabinet and if a customer walks up, put them back until you're finished serving them.  Same goes for dirty rags.

I've seen the following thing at least twice at this location...
The other day there was a mop & bucket behind the counter and there was a clear bin up on top of the back counter that was either soaking or being used as a bucket, with gray water and a rag in it.  The barista was serving a customer at the time.  

I get that this is a small location and I do appreciate that they are keeping things clean, but the thought of them preparing my order kept me from getting in line.  

I don't know the answer and I'm probably being unreasonable."

GZBt6PY2VCgxTW-chVcgcw,xUxDhgS8kUIJ2i_8ST75jw,"I will NEVER choose to go to the Cleveland Clinic again. I went here to do physical therapy for a stiff neck. When I met with the doctor he literally had me look to the right and left and rate my level of pain on a scale from 1-10. Then handed me a print out of 2 exercises to do at home (that I probably could have found on Google) and sent me straight into the schedulers office to schedule a follow up visit. When I had called to make the initial appointment I was very clear about the fact that I wanted to be made aware of any and all charges up front. I verified with my insurance company that they were in fact considered an in-network provider and that I was covered for up to 20 visits. Cleveland Clinic however did not happen to mention they would bill the appointment as an ""outpatient hospital visit"" or that they charge an additional ""facility fee"". They billed my insurance company 1,233.00 for 2 physical therapy visits. Of course, my insurance company is saying that the amount the Cleveland Clinic charged exceeds the amount they will cover for this type of service so they will pay $500 and I'm responsible for the remaining $700 (again...for 2 visits!!!). No wonder the scheduler at the Cleveland Clinic kept calling me trying to get me to make more appointments with them. They were making $500-$600 per visit! Oh and side note... my neck is still sore. :/"

Make time for training every day and go to group classes. And even when you feel stuck, talk about it with Dave and he will surely help you out. He is very knowledgeable in the training feild and will tell you when you are sending your dog mix messages and when your handling your dog properly. Be pateint with yourself and your dog 
Key note: Dave & collar is most important tool I have ever worked with. My first experience was that I was scared of it and that I was going to hurt my dog after some time Dave could see that i was struggling with this and helped me out, I got over it real quick because I couldn't see results in my dog or myself I finally had to get a strong mind and realize I was not going to hurt my dog but I had to use the collar properly. 
My experience training with Dave has been amazing and I have surely seen the results in my dog Leo. I take great pride in training him and making him a better pet I am truly pleased with all our work that Dave has shared with us!
I feel very confindent with my boy now and i have moved to off leash training. Proud mommy"

The beers were creative - we really liked the OPA and hibiscus infused beer was inventive albeit didn't meet our personal tastes. We would be interested in returning to try the other creative beers and would recommend this place to a friend. The standout, however, was the food. It was such a pleasant surprise, knowing nothing about the place when we walked by and decided to give it a try. We're glad we did!"
IFprF9HSrseldTJoERs-vg,oVJr30F2WWKMVtyfxbXACQ,"I was freaking out when my pup-sitter fell through days before a vacation. We found Daniel on the Rover app then connected to his company's website. 

Daniel responded to my text within minutes and we started talking about my dog and the process. He wasn't pushy at all and was very customer oriented. He offered to come to my house to meet us and our pup...and was available the next day!

Meeting Daniel was great. My dog was all over him, giving him kisses. He asked questions about his food, treats, how he sleeps, bathroom situation, and more, while taking notes. After he left my dog got out the front door, ran to Daniel's car and tried to get in...he really wanted to spend more time with him! We decided to go with 3 overnight stays and 2 check ins per day. 

During our vacation we got text and photo updates regularly. When I came home he washed and folded the bed sheets and left a kind thank you note. My pup looked happy and healthy. 

We were so happy with the whole process, it really made leaving my fur baby a lot easier knowing he was with someone he met and liked. We'll be booking again in a couple months!"
sjUMW4YG3B_meHY6JbaGJQ,dpPffiVpyLqkV3aeoZqd6Q,"I am writing this review solely in reference to the Nurse Practitioner that you are forced to see when you are new patient, Jiji Ochoa.  Short version:  Refuse to accept an appointment with this woman. 

 I haven't had health insurance in about a decade and went in for my first visit.  For a place called Dignity Health, I have never been treated with such disrespect.  Her interpersonal communication skills are non existent.  And due to her inability to speak clearly, not her accent, it was a struggle to understand anything she said.  When I asked any questions she became so rude and defensive she would literally leave the room.  

When I spoke to another employee about the experience they rolled their eyes and apologized.  Not only did this ""practitioner"" seem to have zero knowledge about literally anything, her total lack of any kind of compassion or respect was disgusting.  She starts out as a bully and then when you come back at her she leaves the room for up to 20 minutes.  The worst medical experience of my life.  And that includes a clinics in Indonesia and India.

I'm returning for my follow up with Dr. Ritter, but only because I've heard amazing things about her.

Every other aspect of my visit was a 4 to 5 star experience and I'm going back to see Dr Ritter and will update it at that time.  I feel sorry for the rest of the staff that seem to be giving 100% and were nothing, but pleasant and efficient.  I hope someone from Dignity looks into this wench who no doubt spends her days bullying the waiting room full of older, sicker patients.  She definitely wasn't used to someone coming back at her.  She is a disgrace to the medical profession."

-QuusedOBuIdCOKHR161HQ,jt49xjEjQisu6wTTGn6B3A,"Depanneur Saint-Paul is a delightful little coffee and sundries shop in the heart of Old Montreal. 

The coffee bar carries your traditional coffee/espresso beverages plus a smattering of pastries and prepared foods like salads, wraps, etc. I had just gulped down a large coffee and sandwich from another place so I didn't indulge but the menu looked great and the offerings in the case looked delicious. 

It's a bit tight in there and when there's a line for the coffee bar it can be a bit hard to maneuver but it's worth being a little patient and looking through the shop. There are some real gems in there--from delicious packaged cookies and meringues, candy bars, and hard candy, to kitchen staples like spices, salt, sauces, and even some toiletries like deodorant, toothpaste, etc. There's also a cooler against the back of the store with cold bottled beverages, milk, cheese, and the like. 

If you live in the area or are traveling through, they have staples you need to get through the day. Be it caffeine and a muffin, or the mouthwash you forgot."

The Control4 system they installed has never really worked well.  Their service people miss commitments.  Their office has pretty limited hours and so it's hard to communicate with them.  Lots of voicemail messages.  And when the service people do come they can't seem to get the system running correctly.

Located just right behind Malvern mall, this new joint will easily become a new go-to for locals. The setting is a small space with just bar benches against the window so I opted for take-out. The service was good - ran by young gentlemen who knew their wings. They have two menus: one with all their items and the other which just focuses on the wings and what actually goes into them. I got the MALVERN SPECIAL which comes with 1lb of wings (1 flavor), chili and onion fries and pop for $14.95. The flavor i got was Bumble BBQ (honey garlic bbq) which I loved - a good mix of sweet and bbq and the wings were fairly huge so you're sure to get full. The chili onion fries are one of their staples so if you ever get to go there, try them out. On top of this deal, they have daily specials that are hella affordable ($5-$10)!"

He was really knowledgeable, and explained the extra coverage insurance well enough that I decided to spend the extra $ just in case something unexpected happened. He also helped me figure out how many blankets I'd need to pack up my stuff safely and was able to rent them to me - the best part is that I can turn them in when I arrive at my destination! No need to keep a ton of expensive moving blankets around and my stuff all gets there safely!  He was great and I would 100% recommend renting from this UHaul location. Talk to Rico if you can!"

They have local bay area SF brand Nice Collective collection.  As well as, import Transit collection from Italy for men. And there are other brands I have never even or heard of.  Also there is a good selection of women clothing there. A good variety of casual to dressy. This place is a real gem if you like you shop. 

After going to most of the boutique clothing stores on Queen st. this is one of the better selections in style and one of a kind pieces..

But keep in mind one regular collared dress shirt might run about $150-$200 or jackets up to $200-$600, so be prepared to fork over some cash when you shop here."

I chose Sharyl on recommendations I read on this site as well as my face to face meeting with her. I had no clue what I wanted when I walked into her shop. I gave her a few pictures that I liked and talked some things over with her and we went from there. The flowers she produced were GORGEOUS, and the groomsmens boutonnieres were amazing.

It is a small park that is connected to the community pool and Club House. There is also a small play ground for young children. It is also a nice place to walk around at night or go play catch with the kids during the day.

It is really a great spot to view the Red Rock fire works on the 4th of July. The only problem with that is the people coming in to watch that do not live in the community. It causes a massive traffic jam for about an hour or so after the fire works.

One more thing that ruins this park for everyone is that some people do not clean up after their dogs. It would also be better if people kept their dogs on leashes. It is a community park not a dog park."

We were in town for the weekend and my date had the most dull, scuffed, never been shined before dress shoes in tow.  I suggested he get them shined immediately.

The older man, who shined his shoes, was very friendly and talkative.  He went over his shoes 4 times and made them look brand new.  He my date plastic shoe bags to keep his shoes protected until the wedding.   

The man (I think Richard was his name) was very funny and I eavesdropped while they had ""man talk"".  He dropped a few jewels and gave some life advice.  We walked away with an excellent first impression of Cleveland.  A city we've both come to enjoy.

We were disappointed when we were leaving Cleveland and went back to the gate only to find that the man was not working that day.  For 6 bucks its worth the experience and conversation even if you don't really need a fresh shine."

As usual the menu has changed into more of a modern bistro Tapas menu.

The food was awesome and being a Wednesday night the second seating wasn't too busy. Here's what we had:

Smoked Duck - came on a bed of pear sauce/butter, pistachios and topped with some green and a smoked mini-Anjou pear. This dish is not very large but the flavours pop in your mouth!

Steak Tartar - this is not your ordinary steak tartar... with a blend of savoury and sweet flavours mixed into a melt in your mouth Taratar... You get three servings, I could have had a dozen it was so good.

Flatiron Steak Salad - who knew that salad could be so good.  Great produce, amazing tomatoes and a sliced cold flatiron steak cooked to perfection.  Ok, i'll have this one again too.

Great services, Great food, why wouldn't you go again!  I will!"

We were the only patrons in the place, and I warned her what that usually meant. Nevertheless, we ordered the goulasch (sic) special and shrimp alfredo. 

As a rule of thumb, I steer clear of alfredo at diners. there is inevitably that pool of yellowy butter stuff gathered at  the bottom of the plate and the noodles are clumped together and rubbery. It really is one of the most difficult dishes for a diner to do well. But, that's what the wife ordered. 

Well, pleasantly surprised. the alfredo was fresh, light, and consistent. Goulash as well. Terrific dishes with ample portions. And, the space was bright and comfortable with incredibly tall front doors. If the rest of the food is as good as what we were served, this place has promise. Prices are very low. We walked away for around $20.

Only fours stars for two reasons. First, the TV. Such a great space should be paired with some nice music, not NBC. turn them off. Secondly, no garnish, vegetable, or anything in the dishes. Just pasta and meat. Entrees need some complexity, even if it's on the side. So in conclusion, I should listen to my wife more."

It has been open for awhile now, so there really is no excuse for their business to be as inadequate as it is. There is never anybody in the drive thru, but every single time I've gone they have pulled me out of the line to park and wait for my order. This would be fine, although I don't understand why it always always happens, if my order had ever been correct. There is always something missing, and the items are never assembled or cooked properly. Today was my last try. I made a $37 lunch order, so it was understandable that I was pulled forward to wait. However, I waited there for them to bring out soggy fries, nearly uncooked chicken nuggets, and cold, hard chicken sandwiches made with an exponential amount of mayo on both pieces of bread when I asked for no mayo. I also specifically asked for a ""lot of ketchup"" in the bag, but received none, and no nugget sauce. I also did not receive any of the desserts I ordered. In conclusion, I spent $40 on fast food today and not a single bite of it was edible. I don't really understand how that works but thanks for the Sprite guys, it was nice and cold. They do not have an Icee machine as advertised, and are often out of things."

Ridiculous. I have filed several complaints and was told it would be dealt with. Now I get a letter today that they have sent those charges to collections. Horrible company!! No communication at all.

My daughter was sent home with an unreported bite. When I confronted them, it turned out that a staff member had seen it and just chose not to report it because she can't write or speak in English.  The last straw was seeing that Spanish speaking lady smack a kids hand when he went to grab the hose outside near the playground. I WAS given a refund since I had legitimate safety concerns for my daughter... but it was ridiculous. I do NOT recommend this place. It's not safe for children. Also,  they serve fluids in a regular cup to one year Olds and my daughter got dehydrated on several occasions because she can't drink out of a regular cup or doesn't know how to ask for a drink. This wasn't corrected until I mentioned it, and still occurred a few times afterward. Do NOT go here!"
p6un9kh884ewoCy-MDjLYQ,q5FQmuXxzPEsvEtA_Mvd1w,Pretty decent selection of shoes. I would say better than Foot Locker surprisingly. They were a lot more friendly and helpful then Foot Locker was as well. They didn't offer larger sizes just like Foot Locker.
p6un9kh884ewoCy-MDjLYQ,3xORNxbKdd08LUf0tclx3A,"A fairly underwhelming selection of football products. The store is somewhat small, so I am sure inventory concerns impact the product line. Maybe it is just me, but I don't think it would be too challenging to identify customer interest and offer products to fit the need.  

Baseball season is winding down, so a reduction in baseball products would make sense. Have some minimal offerings for Diamondbacks and a couple of teams that might actually make the playoffs. The majority of people shopping now most likely are interested in football. For the Cardinals, 95% of people who want a regular Cardinals jersey already have one, so focus on the new black alternative jersey (which they did have a nice selection at $80 for a replica and $110 for an authentic). 

Besides Cardinals products, college football would be a main focus. With schools back in session and the college schedule starting last week that is probably a high interest product right now. In the crazy scheme to make money, I would expect sporting goods stores to have a big selection right now. And considering most people are not from here, a selection of other schools would be nice to see. Again, given the size of the store the number of schools would be limited and I probably would not find my Marshall Thundering Herd on the shelf, but it should be more than only ASU and AU. 

Having went to Dicks, Champs and the Sports Chalet only to discover none of them had jerseys except a couple offering ASU or AU, I went back to Just Sports. No jerseys, but they did have a few t-shirts. Again, mostly ASU with some AU - then I stumbled on a Wake Forest shirt. That seemed odd...but soon I found a handful of other schools. It was all the same design of shirt, which resembled only slightly higher quality than a Tent City screen-print station, but for my needs it would have to do. I flipped through the one rack about four times hoping something would jump out. Finally worker A tore himself away from the conversation with worker B and asked if I was looking for a particular team. When I said yeah, one that doesn't suck, he only offered the comments ""Good luck"". The shirts were decently priced - $20 for 2 or $12.99 for one, but the selection made it a challenge to find one - let alone two."

fHv2WuWZcwnDsBqhl_LmrA,O50NzGrEw-gM6ypZHjCvMA,Whoever put up that last review was clearly one of the workers. This place is awful and the asshole that owns it is a complete douche bag. I worked at the EatnPark in the same plaza and i can't even tell you how many times my coworkers had problems with that shit head. I've even heard stories about him hitting on some of the 16 year old waitresses that we had. Thats just disgusting. There was even this elderly lady that came in just to sit in our waiting area so she could call the police on him because apparently he threw money back into the face of her husband because of a stupid argument. How can you possibly treat customers like that? Especially if they're elderly??? Ive never come across a more disrespectful sack of shit in my entire life. They don't even have that great of a selection to choose from. Plus the fact that the owner acts like he owns the world makes it even worse. All the employees do is just sit on their video games all day and do nothing productive whatsoever. Safe to say none of them are going anywhere in life (especially the owner who's probably going to get his ass kicked in the near future for being such an arrogant sack of shit). Don't even bother going in there. I'd personally prefer going to market district or giant eagle up the street which is further from my house rather than go give this douche bag business. And God knows he could use the business--no ones ever in there. Probably because he's pissed off all his customers. Why would you want to go give business to someone who's a complete asshole and hits on 16 year old waitresses? Just avoid this place at all cost (unless you're going in there to beat the shit out of that asshole).

_80vznYut7O0Vq6F5-95Zw,Qsu2EtNn99_oVG9bS4Miaw,"Now that I've tried all of the types of chocolate bars here, I will add some comments for potential buyers. All of the chocolates are quite dark, so if you're not into the bitterness of dark chocolate, you just won't like anything offered here.

The hemp gold is nice, a bit mild and has a nice saltiness. 

The luscious coconut was also mild and was the most similar to a chocolate bar that you would buy elsewhere. 

The raw vanilla was good, but I didn't get a strong vanilla flavour and couldn't really tell the difference between the darkness. 

Darkness was very dark and bitter! Tasty, but certainly not for newbies!

The five chilli bullet was just too savoury for me. If you like chocolate as a sweet treat, the dark chocolate combined with chilli is not the bar for you.

I really liked hemp gold and luscious coconut and will become a regular buyer of those bars!"

iDTIUgQy59uCcdMVEtKgEQ,7_EXcW2umdoi9T8KpjqrDA,"This cafeteria gets a lot of traffic because there really isn't anything else in the area to eat. As far as Grab and Go food, this is the only cafeteria within the 3 block radius. So don't take the crowds as a sign of good food. The food is somewhere between prison and high school cafeteria food. Usually unsalted, lazy, but cheap. 

Entrees run $8.50 - $10, sandwiches and wraps about $6-$8. Soups start at $3.50 and the salad is one set price, by the box. However, it's the most boring lettuce only salad bar. I'm guessing everything is bought in frozen bulk and prepped, which is why it's so mediocre. 

There's a cash line and debit/credit line, so bring cash if you don't want to wait another 10 minutes to get out of here."

It's definitely not PPM or GFM, but I didn't expect it to be.  All of the vendors were friendly and informative.  We ended up buying some Double Blessing Goat Milk Lotion...the stuff smells fantastic (purchased the Sandalwood Vanilla and Spiced Fig).  There was a grower there, and I wanted to buy a rosemary plant, but J suggested we don't buy anything until we get our garden situation sorted out in the next few months.

I understand the pilots are cautious and carefully determine when conditions are safe enough to fly. That is fine. However, with such expensive, yet unreliable service, having a strict No Refund policy is unfair, poor customer service, and quite frankly, nearly criminal. Any complaint made to the company is met with ""sorry, there are no refunds"". I responded with, ""so, we could be doing this for ten years then?"" His answer? ""Well you're only at 4 years, so you have 6 years to go""......
There needs to be changes made to their policies so these circumstances can be dealt with reasonably. It is ludicrous for people to have spent hundreds of dollars for a service and some receive it right away, some 2 years down the road, some 5 years down the road, or some who just give up and take the loss. There needs to be a maximum amount of time or attempts and then they need to be fair and offer refunds. 
Cookie cutter responses about safety and ""we hope to have you fly with us soon"" are not enough, they are not acceptable, and they are not going to help promote their business."

I was very excited to meet with her and she left my place saying she'd get back with me.

Their amazing collection of chocolates and especially my favorite dark chocolates and salty caramels made the cold winter days brighter and my nice summer days sparkling with the fanfare of their exceptional hospitality and artisan tapestry of flavors. When you step in the store, brace yourself for a wonderful journey of discovery in taste, filled with laughters.

Super Submarine doesn't have all of the flashy options that subway has like the six kinds of breads, or the twenty different toppings, but what they do have is someone who is going to construct a sub with care. I can't remember the last time I had a sub so well constructed. I got it to go and when I unwrapped it at home it was still a perfectly constructed submarine. They may not have tons of toppings, but they have all the ones that matter. (lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, green pepper, red onion, hot peppers, olives) Extra points for having green, not black, olives.

The sub tasted nostalgic to me. It reminded me of a place my dad used to buy subs called Big John's back in Kitchener-Waterloo. Soft white bun, plenty of mayo, and all the other toppings you need."

Overall I like the selection Teavana offers - a lot of excellent choices for iced teas, which I prefer in the summer. Some flavors can be quite strong, so I recommend buying in small quantities in case you grow tired of them after a cup or two. Purchases here earn stars on your Starbucks app - good to know if you're counting. 

My only criticism is that they seem to add sugar to everything and I suspect some of the teas might even have sugar or sweetener added to the dry ingredients before brewing occurs. It would be better if they left it out and offered Splenda as an option for sweetening."

I went with Rana L. to the L2 class on Monday with Karin and was truly impressed by her engaged approach to teaching and her students. She finds ways to challenge everyone but she also makes a point of giving beginners alternative poses so nobody gets left behind. The class was fairly large but it seemed like Karin took the time to help each and every student, even me :-)  She has a rare talent for challenging students as much as encouraging them - I didn't feel bored by lack of challenge but I wasn't frustrated by difficult poses because I Karin helped everyone do their best.

hk6uoKi8Ir9091R-ztCWdw,1soKskzOcVzCGPNUIIU6cQ,"FINAL UPDATE: On 7/13 I was finally contacted by the District Manager. He was very respectful and we had a genuinely nice chat about customer service philosophy. I regret that it took a week to get this resolved, but in the end he made it right. 

All in all, Avail has great flavors and a good line of equipment. My experience with their customer service was a bit protracted and arduous, but I don't think that is representative of all interactions.  

* * *

UPDATE: Avail Vapors contacted me after this review on 7/8 for my contact information so that they could make things right. I gave them my phone number and they told me that someone would reach out to me soon, but I might have to wait as long as Monday. I thought that was sensible, even if I had to wait. I followed up with my online contact on Monday, 7/11 after I had not heard anything. This morning (Wednesday, 7/13) I called the store to follow up. I am *completely bewildered* at what took place next. 

 I spoke with an assistant manager who identified the product in question, then proceeded to tell me that it was now WAY past the warranty date. He had ""No proof"" that we had been in there to return the defective battery when we did. He went on to explain that since there was ""no proof,"" there was nothing he could do. Avail Vapors is in possession of both the defective product in it's original packaging and the receipt. I asked him to explain that logic to me (having no proof that we were in the store to return a product a week ago) and he told me I was becoming ""hostile.""  I was asking for a logical explanation for what is now becoming clear is a dishonest business practice. I did not raise my voice or treat this employee with disrespect. 

After this conversation my husband and I gave up and drove to Brick City Vapors in North Olmsted and bought him a new device. I will also be buying all of my replacement coils, juice, and replacement parts there. I don't think they will treat me with the disrespect that Avail Vapors has. 
  
* * * 

Avail Vapors must be doing well if they can afford to treat their customers the way they do. I initially was very pleased with the shop, but after today my husband and I will take our business somewhere else. I'm not naive to vaping. I understand that equipment fails after awhile and needs to be replaced--in fact, I bought a replacement tank there when my old one wore out. However, I also understand that sometimes equipment is defective and a good seller takes responsibility for that. 

On 6/5 we bought a starter kit for my husband who is an occasional vaper. I generally expect these kinds of setups to last anywhere between 3 and 6 months before something goes wrong with the battery and new equipment is needed. Actually, we were buying it to replace a kit my husband had that was failing. Yesterday, on 7/7 the battery on the Avail kit stopped holding a charge, so we brought it back to the store with the original packaging and receipt. It is true that it was two days past the warranty, but it was clearly a defective product. I would expect that a responsible retailer would replace the battery in order to keep the business of repeat clients--it's not like two months had gone by past the warranty, or even two weeks. It was two days, roughly 48 hours. I wouldn't have taken it back if it weren't a reasonable request. 

Avail Vapors refused to replace the battery, so we left the defective product with them and walked out of the store. They lost the roughly $100-$150 that I would have spent there each month all over a cheap $20 battery and self-righteous inflexibility. Establishing an adversarial relationship with your customer base is not good business practice."
8JvuhiQWoMJVDVuTtvOnPA,UTKB35R4HvRQOHP96MuhSA,"Ordered through Grubhub, I was excited to see a Mexican restaurant delivered in my area so I gave them a try. Our order got here fairly quick and driver was nice. He handed me the bag and I swore something was missing as it was so light. When I opened the bag it seemed all was there. My order consisted of two crispy taco and one soft taco meal plus an order of tortilla soup. The soft taco meal according to the menu on grubhub comes with two tacos, beans and rice, it did not have beans or rice and the so called tacos were a few pieces of carne asada on tortillas a bit smaller then a rice cake, the little meat they had was good. The crispy taco meals were a bit better, you get three as opposed to the two in the soft taco meal. You cant see them at first because they are cover by lettuce and a tiny tomato with a few shreds of cheese (there must have been 10 pieces of cheese, ridiculous only reason I knew was there was the contrast in color). The tacos themselves were so thin with very little anything inside, unlike the photo on the page, a jack in the box taco has more meat. The beans were very spicy and more like soup then typical refried beans although im not sure that's what they were supposed to be since most spilled into the rest of the container. The rice was very very bland and the grains were hard as if not cooked long enough plus had this greasy texture, it had NO positive attributes. Finally the soup, a little too spicy for me but don't pay to much into that but mom liked it. With all the great Mexican restaurants in Phoenix and even in the area one that delivers could have been a slam dunk but felt was a complete waste of $30, if I had walked to Fediricos on 35th and camelback I would have had enough food for days and it would have been good.

And just a coupla days ago, I get this bill in the mail stating that I owe them money for HST, ""Advancement Fee"", and HST for the Fee.  I call FedEx to ask them about this strange after-the-fact bullshit bill and they claim that it was a Canada Borders Services issues and pass me their phone number.

I knew that didn't sound right as the bill CLEARLY states ""Advancement Fee"", etc.  I speak to CBSA and they said they have nothing to do with this bill and that coffee is not a taxable product.

If you charge the receiver upon delivery, that's one thing.  However, if you send them a letter, months later, don't expect anyone to pay up!  You were paid $100 already, now buzz off!!!"
vAiOsiJcyNiuFz0WDM8kiQ,U5YQX_vMl_xQy8EQDqlNQQ,"Tip:  Before you sit in a chair, ask how much the cut will be!

Back in the Summer, a friend of mine called to ask how much a cut would cost.  She was quoted $25.  We didn't end up going for some reason, but I did just get my haircut and it was $45, including taxes (not tip).

It was even more expensive for a friend with longer hair.  And after we paid, I was kinda embarrassed 'cause I had told her that it was $25.  I think even $35 would've been ok, but it was almost double what I initially quoted her!

I have a regular stylist downtown, but I just haven't gone to her for the last coupla cuts due to proximity.  She is $33, all in, and will spend approx. an hour cutting.

Anyway, Paul did our cuts.  They were quick and to the point.  He just needs an idea of what you want.  There is no long consultation process.  At times, it was difficult to chat with him 'cause of the blow dryer.

I liked the results, but won't fully know 'til I wash my hair myself.

Again, the only issue I had was cost.  I should've just ask prior to the cut, but assumed what was quoted to me a few months ago.  It seems like a lot of their clientele, especially during my visit, were older, European women, so I'm sure their cuts aren't $45, but closer to $25."

Normally it has a lot more choices then what it did today .However I was not impressed today . Not sure if what the time I got here or just a heavy rush but seemed like almost everything was gone . Had the stuffed shells cause it was about all that was left . They were ok and the price was only $2.99 so cant complain about that. There is no inside dinning so you take the food to go. Hopefully the next time I come back and there are more option and I can raise the star rating .
HX63oml64Cxd_mraYT699g,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,"The Cactus Wren Trail is a 1.5 mile paved trail in the westernmost area of Henderson bounded by Eastern Avenue to the west, Interstate 215 to the north, and St. Rose Parkway to the east and south. The one mile north to south segment from the 215 Beltway Trail at the north to the Northeast corner of Eastern Avenue at Ione Road travels along a wash in the back of the Eastern Avenue shopping centers and a subdivision to the west and a low density housing community interspersed with open fields to the east. The 0.5 mile west to east segment from Eastern at Ione to the west and both Cactus Wren Park and the St. Rose Parkway pedestrian bridge to the east is a concurrently with the unsigned Amargosa Trail in a residential community that is a walkway for Ione Road half the distance. 

  Today I wanted to go on an easy hike. So, I headed out for the Cactus Wren Trail. I am no stranger to this trail. Back in 2012, I hiked on it when I reviewed Cactus Wren Park. And when hiking or bicycling on the Cactus Wren Park, Cactus Wren Park in my opinion is the best place to park. Both times that I visited Cactus Wren Park, there was a sufficient number of people that were a detriment to criminals. 

  The cool thing about parking at Cactus Wren Park is that the St. rose Parkway bridge, part of the St. Rose Parkway Trail, is an elevated spot to take in the Las Vegas Strip in the distance below. In reality, this is probably the prettiest spot of the Cactus Wren Trail. 

  As Norm. K stated, signing is relatively nonexistent from the trail. I only saw one small Cactus Wren sign at the northernmost end at the 215 Beltway Trail. From Cactus Wren Park, I followed the power lines on a bridge across a wash onto a paved trail. These are the power lines that are analogous to the Amargosa gsa Trail. There were two surface Street crossings. The Ione Road crossing is in need of a crosswalk. Especially with the blind spot from the curve on Ione Road. After crossing Ione Road the trail is a dual topography that is unsurfaced under the power lines and a sidewalk parallel to Ione Road. 

  At the northeast corner of Ione and Eastern, the Armogsa Trail reaches one of its dead-ends when it splits from Cactus Wren Trail. Cactus Wren now heads due north toward Serene Avenue and the 215 Beltway Trail at the Interstate 215 sound wall as it parallels a wash. With the exception of a hill immediately north of the split, the elevation is relatively flat. The trail is in good condition. I rate it 80% on the graffiti - free scale. The small number of tagging I saw was on the concrete walls of the wash. The two benches, street lights that illuminate automatically at night, and trash cans were untouched by vandals. 

  The landscape is ordinary. It is in want of the plush landscaping that is prevalent alongside the Seven Hills and Green Valley Ranch trail systems. Looking west, for the most part I was looking at a concrete wash bordering the backs of the shopping centers off Eastern Avenue. The back of a shopping center isn't attractive. When I looked to the east I saw fences interspersed with open spaces. 

  My wildlife observations were an antelope squirrel and some birds. But what about the Cactus Wren, that long harsh voiced singing bird found in the Southwest and what the trail is named after?  I didn't hear one. Then again, the sounds overheard from Eastern Avenue traffic and landscapers would block it out. 

  On the south to North segment, there is one crossing at Serene Avenue. At this spot, Serene Avenue is a two lane road where a nearby traffic circle slows down traffic. Regardless, the crosswalk could use a flashing light that informs motorists that a pedestrian is in the crosswalk. A short distance North of Serene Avenue, Cactus Wren Trail will end at the 215 Beltway Trail, where a left will lead to Eastern and ultimately to Warm Springs and a right will lead to Pecos Road. 

  Both times I made a left on Eastern to patronize a business on the east side. It is in close proximity to several restaurants including Taco Y Taco, In N Out, Cafe Zupas, Denny's, and so on. But I just ate and stopped at Seven Eleven for a refreshment. 

  The Cactus Wren is a good trail that is part of the tapestry of the outstanding City of Henderson trail system. I believe that it has a potential to be a four star trail if the City of Henderson works with the Department of Transportation to carry it over the 215 Beltway to Pebble Park where it will connect to the Pitman Wash Trail. Signing with a concurrency of the  Amargosa Trail between the St. Rose Parkway Bridge to Eastern would also up Cactus Wren Trail a star. Until this happens I am signing off this review by representing Cactus Wren Trail with three stars."
rIv4K_LvVbPwC9tPO_fwYw,FQtpyxYN5LvPTKX4Sv0U8A,"This place is an absolute diamond in the rough! My friend and I had a hankering for wings a while back and the one other review on yelp sounded so enticing,  we thought we would check it out. 

The place is a little difficult to find (be on the north sode of the light rail tracks, heading west, and turn in by the car shop), but your efforts will not be unrewarded.  Inside is very basic, nothing fancy here. This business is delicious food, no time for pomp and circumstance. 

The owner of New York Classic Subs is straight out of Buffalo NY and he knows his wings. These puppies are big, meaty, and slathered in the perfect spicy yet flavorful wing sauce in the valley. If you have ever had Duff's or Anchor Bar wings (the original ""Buffalo Wings"" in upstate New York, you'll be having flashbacks of greatness when you taste these phenomenal imports! Best part: the price per pound of wing is one of the best around. 

For those not looking for wings, I hear the number one customer complaint is that the sandwich options ""are just too big to eat at one time"". I, for one, see that as a compliment. 

TL; DR-great, cheap buffalo wings. Good food in a small little corner of Phoenix."

Db9eRcJWPMK0C3kX2Z83jg,47SIxSzlWp3_CDSveh3wvA,"I needed to get two diplomas and a professional certificate framed after having let them sit around unprotected for too long.  I was going to go to Michael's or some other similar store but after hearing how outrageous their prices are (especially without any kind of coupon) I wanted to shop around and found Art Etc. in my own neighborhood.  I've lived in the area for years and never noticed it, but I'm sure glad I discovered it!

I went in on a Saturday morning to check out their pricing to see how it would compare to Michael's (with a 60% off coupon).  Long story short, their prices were pretty much the same (full price at Art Etc. versus 60% at Michael's).  After visiting Art Etc. and Michael's, I gave my business to Art Etc.

The selection of frames at this little store in Little Italy is superb!  Michael's had only a fraction of the selection.  Not only that, but at Art Etc. you could walk around and touch and pick up the frame samples, which is not a luxury you get at Michael's.

Debbie at Art Etc. was fantastic!  She was so helpful and eager to help me find frames and mat colors that suited my needs.  Custom framing isn't cheap, so you want to make sure you get it right.  At Michael's you've got some person behind a counter trying to assist you with impatient people behind you in a line.  Not good.  I believe Debbie said she has 26 years of experience in framing (and certifications to go along with it), and it showed in the quality of the product I got back.  Not only that, even without the supplies on hand, Art Etc. got my framed documents back to me a week faster than Michael's said they could.

Do yourself a favor and check out Art Etc. the next time you need something framed.  With competitive prices, fantastic customer service, and experienced framing professionals, there's no reason to go anywhere else.  The best part is you can feel good about supporting local businesses!"

It's not the best of Giant Eagle's -- there is no butcher section for meats, though there is for seafood.
And, my biggest concern  now is that on 2 occasions within 4 months, I've been approached, stalked in the store, and approached and spoken to without invitation by the same stalker in the parking lot, and both times, luckily they were easily enough dismissed.  I would have requested store security to walk me to my car, but in both instances they (the stalkers) appeared to have gone away and were nowhere around between the time I stood in line to checkout to the time I walked out of the store.  And both times were in broad daylight in a busy parking lot.  I don't care what their intentions were; their advances were most unwelcomed.

I did get Unique Smile out of it.  Said she was returning my call.  I told her I didn't call her.  She said Sonny (last name) called and she was returning the call.  I said oh sorry there is no Sonny () here I thought you said Penny, you have the wrong number.  That is why we are both so confused.  She told me I was rude and hung up on me.  Someone needs to teach her phone etiquette.  She is who interrupted my work for no reason and then was short and snotty with me for not understanding her when she is talking entirely too fast.

1qmsZxZZWvRsy5Z31MKerQ,62GNFh5FySkA3MbrQmnqvg,"Like my man Rod has said, several years ago, Charlotte Restaurant Week was much better. It was the place to see and be seen, with each place crawling over the next to try and outdo one another to attract diners with interesting choices during the biannual event.

Now, it's more like a line at a buffet, and a poor man's buffet at that. While I don't have a problem with a buffet - and even a poor man's buffet - the quantity of restaurants has gone up, while the variety has gone way down.

The issue is that at many places, they really struggle to put out a menu where you feel like you are getting your money's worth for the price (currently $30). In other parts of the country, you sit down for the price and feel you get a heck of a deal. They even have lunch offerings for a slightly lower cost.

However it just seems many places in Charlotte are just phoning it in these days, with the bare minimum of three courses, often about what you get at regular menu price - and at least one, offering a single salad option, one appetizer and only two or three entree choices. Really, Charlotte? Is this the best you can do?

While there are a handful of places (usually those that offer steak, or with higher ticket prices) that will give you good value for your dollar, most still don't offer a terribly interesting menu during restaurant week. It's a busy week for them, and I get that - they want to make things simple on their staff. But they shouldn't do it at the expense of the customer.

This latest round saw only a handful offer truly interesting menus, and while it still brings in customers, it would be nice to see restaurants stretch themselves rather than sinking to the lowest common denominator."

And they say that the QT Kitchen has good food, though I have to admit that I don't know if I have ever actually been inside one.

This particular location isn't the simplest to get to, if coming from 77, as you have to go down, turn left, turn left, and possibly wait. So there are easier ones that you can find, and to make matters worse, that traffic can get bad, so you may want to hope you're not in a bind (or go to another station prior to the QT).

But still, it's not bad overall."

RwUpsp3JUzfph225l-UBOw,HEvyblFw4I-UsMqgPGYY_Q,"My 6 year old son is hard on electronic equipment and he shattered the screen on his iPad. I looked around at several places that can do iPad repairs in Henderson and Las Vegas, but as I was coming out of Fox Smokehouse BBQ one day I noticed Boulder City iPhone Repair. I went in and talked to the owner and got a quote on what it would take to fix the iPad. Having done some research into doing it myself I knew the prices for the components like the screen and digitizer, and I found his pricing to be spot on. 

Today I took the iPad in at 1:45 pm and dropped it off. It was a mess complete with dents on the corners and a 1 x 1/2 piece of glass completely missing. In the time it took my family and I to get our hair cut at the salon next door and grab lunch at Fox Smokehouse BBQ it was brought back to life. For a little over $100 I got a new screen installed and the dented corners had been carefully massaged back out and are now back to their normal rounded shape. 

I've been in IT for over 20 years and seen a lot of bad repairs. I'm sitting here typing this and looking at the iPad charging and updating beside me and in my opinion this is a top notch repair. There is no excess adhesive coming out from the edge of the case. The iPad works perfectly, just like the day I unboxed it for the first time. I've meticulously looked it over from top to bottom and have absolutely no complaints about the repair and the time it took to complete. 

I highly recommend considering Boulder City iPad Repair if you have a cracked phone or iPad screen. You can grab some of the best BBQ in the city right next door, and your device will be repaired quickly, professionally, and at a very fair and competitive price. The owner is nice to talk to and very knowledgeable. And if you have your repair done here you're supporting a family owned business and not a chain. 

5 Stars. All of them earned. One of the best repairs I've ever seen done to any electronic device I've owned in 20 years and counting. Oh and there is a PokeStop right next door at the BBQ place so if you are waiting on a repair you can load up with all the Pokeballs and things you need to Catch Them All!"

Some items are just 10% or 20% off but does not specify. They made it even more complicated that they tore down all the scanners. 

I was in the toddler section and had some items. Some were obvious returns due to the scanning labels so I didn't know exactly how much they were. There were 2 checkout stations in the area. One didn't have anyone and one had a line with two people at the counter. I went over there and when it was my turn I asked the lady, Denise how much some of the items were. She said ""I don't know!! You can't checkout here!!"" Geeze, sorry. I told her I didn't know and she slammed each item down and just started naming prices making me feel dumb. She told me to go to the other checkout stand if I want to pay for my items because apparently this area was for returns only. I told her there was no one there. And she told me to go somewhere else. I started to walk all the way over to the kitchen dept and she's seriously yelling at me down the whole store. I didn't turn around. I went to a checkout area and Barbara was there and I told her my horrible experience. She apologized for Denise and said Denise should of told me where the checkout section was when I was standing in line rather than having me wait. She told me she would help me and was super sweet about it. 

Out of my 10 items, only 1 item was listed as an additional 20% off. So I saved $2.

No matter how lost or spotty I look I always feel welcomed.

Generally they are mostly anglophones but make a valiant effort to serve in French be it your language of choice. The employees are rather chatty and providing you're a frequent customer, you can really bond with them.

I feel their only flaw would be that they can be a little overzealous at times (""You would LOVE this, let's try it! No? Let's try the other one! Were you looking for this and that as well?"") but a polite ""Just browsing thank you"" does the trick.

The problem I have is when we finally got to a room it was split and we had to share the room with another patient. You can hear all the other patients private info and of course they can hear yours.

I actually called initially to just let them know that they weren't getting things right to see if maybe they can improve themselves I spoke to the manager Mario who from the beginning would not let me get a word edge wise  I was polite and every time I said something he would talk over me. He  had no idea about any type of customer service if he knew any better he would realize that people just really want to be heard. I tried to explain to him that he needed to at least let me explain to him what the situation was I wasn't trying to get anything for free I just wanted him to give us better customer service I don't ever want to order from this place again there's plenty of pizza places in this town and service is huge for me.

The lady here will tell you to wait if the job is quick, and fix it in front of you. Things that used to take me days to get it fixed, it took her 10 minutes, and she did the best job. She charged me for almost 1/5 of how much i usually pay for.

Last year I walked into their booth twice: once at the Pittsburgh remodeling show and again the Pittsburgh Home Show. Yesterday, again, I visited their display booth at the 2011 remodeling show. In every single instance, I was the only person in their display area and I was completely ignored each and every time. Not one acknowledgment, greeting or inquiry if I needed assistance. At the 2010 home show, they wouldn't look up from their newspaper - evidently ""Peanuts"" is more important than connecting with prospective customers.

I have given this place several chances, and every time I come here I am incredibly disappointed with the food. The butter chicken has no flavour. I don't usually add salt to my meals. However, I had to add THREE packages of salt to my meal. That is crazy! The chicken legs looks incredibly dry due to sitting under the heat lamps all day. They should not appear to have wrinkles on the skin. My colleagues have bought the chicken legs for lunch, and the meat was stringy--not normal for chicken legs.

I was ordering 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings. Unfortunately, they no longer sell them this way. You would have to buy a side of fries and a side of onion rings. Therefore, they have lost my business forever.

The owners are fortunate that they get unsuspecting and new customers each day because it is a hospital. If their business were based on returning customers, they would go bankrupt very quickly. Also look at the lineups. There's lineups at Subway, Hero Burger, and Druxy's. The staff knows not to eat there because they know that the food is horrible."

Dr. Jaurez is amazing, hes so great and answers all the questions you may have and is soft spoken and kind. 
His staff on the other hand....I went back and forth with them in two different situations because its apparently pretty hard to call in a prescription to a pharmacy. It probably doesn't help that the office is only open 3 days a week but in both instances they never even sent the script over. This last time when I was finally down to the wire I asked if I could come in to pick up a hard copy so that I myself could drop it off. After many let me asks, they finally said I could. Only when I got there it took 15 minutes to ""figure out"" why I needed a hard copy. 

They also hate answering questions like:
 ""I haven't received my blood work back who should I talk to?"" 
to which the answer was ""Uh, a nurse? But shes not here.""
 ""Okay, when is she here.""
""During hours of operation.""

Its been two weeks since then and I haven't got my results or talked to said nurse who seems to never be there.

I made my most recent visit during a Brewpub Crawl with a social Group.

The Brewery is long and narrow, and you can barely extend your gaze anywhere within without catching sight of an artifact or relic from the 1980's, or 70's or even further back.  You can purchase either a single beer or a flight of 4 which I did when I 1st visited in Jan.

I didn't have a very long wait which was nice. The stylist that was doing my hair was very nice. She washed it, dried it, and styled it. I liked the final result but the time it took for the stylist to complete it was extremely long. It was one of longest visits I've ever had. Unfortunately the length of the visit took up too much of my energy. I had to cut my time short at the event I was at. That was very disappointing.

The bright note of this visit was the young at the concession stand figured out the best deal for the money for me. 
The auditorium was clean but smelled musty. There were no problems with the movie.  It ran fine. There were only four of us in the theater on a Wednesday night.

Then I told her I worked at a nail salon before, and she told me I should ""do your own nails then.""Then she aggressively grabs my hands and shakes them around and I told her I do not appreciate her grabbing me and being aggressive. She put her Hands RIGHT in my face and said I was talking to much and she didn't want to talk to me and walked away. I have never been so shocked and disrespected. I even said politely  ""as a paying customer I do not appreciate you grabbing my hands and putting your hands in my face."" and she continued to say that I talked to much.

When painting one layer, usually salons will put a tiny fan beside so it can dry. They do not have that. They are under equipped and do not give quality service.

He has us always in a calm voice when communicating to our dogs on all occasions, good or bad. As long as you use the tools he gives you and practice them, you will be in great shape. He provides 3 group classes a week you can attend for extra help. It helped our dogs be around other dogs, it allows them to like and be around other humans as well. Dave doesn't force me or the dogs to do anything we do not feel comfortable doing. It does all depend with the owner or onwner's of the dog on how fast your dog will learn new habits and tricks. 

We recently adopted two older (Terrier) boy dogs that are maybe 7 and 8 years old the vets says. We also decided to get a 10 week girl pit bull at the time. One of the boys would try to attack the baby every time he saw her. I felt stuck and did not think my dogs would ever be in the same room, let alone even get along. Dave helped us with just a few at home lessons and now they are inseparable!! They play, tease and steal eachother's bones everyday.

rSlRme1T_RRH1ORg_YyVjQ,bIXdXTXKm2AXZ_fVBN7aAg,"UPDATE: The elevator has broken at least 3 times since my last review and one of them is still broken. This morning I waited for the elevator for a few minutes (should have walked) only to be greeted by an elevator loaded with construction workers going up with loads of equipment. Thanks round house, I truly despise your management team. 

Let me first begin with the good.

The units are surprisingly spacious and unique.  The location is amazing - right off of State Street and you can pretty much walk anywhere.  Before you read any of this, please know that the staff members there are pretty awesome.  I always have good conversations with them and they're very inviting and helpful.  I've never had an issue with them.  It's the apartment structure that sucks.

That being said, there are a lot of negatives.  Everything OTHER than the units themselves are disgusting.  The entrance doors are broken half the time, the elevator buttons, the elevators are gross (more to come on elevators), the laundry facility is atrocious, the hallways are scuffed up and dirty, and it smells like weed or dirty socks on every other floor.  

Back to the elevators - they're filthy after every weekend and usually takes a few days to be cleaned.  There is usually some sort of food or liquid smeared on the floor and walls, and sometimes doesn't get cleaned.  As of now, there is burrito smeared on the elevator security camera, and it has been there for at least one month. Everytime I step into the elevator I get the feeling I'm going to be stuck there because it moves so slowly and there are so many bumps on the ride.  You also have to press your floor button at least 3 times to ensure you get to your destination.  They're so bad, the lights that indicate which floor you're aren't even maintained.  If you press the button to go down or up on any floor, both elevators will come for you, and after your done, the elevator will automatically go to the 1st or 9th floor...so odd and ANNOYING.  The best part about it is that prior to my lease signing, they told me they were having the elevators re-done one month after I moved in.  Clearly, management is honest. 

What makes me even more upset is that they're currently in the process of adding 42 units to the side of the building.  They have the nerve to leave the rest of the building in utter disarray while the BUILD BRAND NEW UNITS on the side of the building, with construction going everyday but Sunday.  By the way, they also told me construction would not happen on the weekends.  They sent me a letter to re-sign my lease and increased rent to $1100 a month. (a $300 increase).  

Last but not least, their air-conditioners don't work and their maintenance crew is awful.  

Just want to say to CHT, thanks for the worst 12 months of apartment renting I've ever experienced."

I had nowhere else to park and didn't have any more cash on me. My husband had to walk a mile to get to Native Bar and Grill, because the staff lied to me. I won't be using this lot next time. $20 wasted."

 ZAHAVY is a terrible service. I phoned ZAHAVY, but always got ""Limousine service"" as an answer. Possibly, AAROPORT and ZAHAVY are hiding behind the name ""Limousine service.""

ZAHAVY COMPLAINT


On 10th January 2017, I booked a limousine for a ride for my wife and I from 21 Burkebrook Place ,Toronto, to Pearson Airport, with ""Limousine service"" taking my call.
I specifically requested that  a limousine be used and not a SUV or truck as my wife has mobility issues having had two strokes, and needs a wheel chair at the airport and cannot climb up into or out of  high vehicles.
On 11th January vehicle number 100 arrived. It was a SUV. It was most difficult for my wife to get into the vehicle, and most embarrassing for her to be physically lifted into the vehicle by the driver  and myself.  
The driver apologised, but that did not make up for the the problem.
I phoned four times afterwards to try to speak to ZAHAVY'S manager and was told to speak to ""Amrick."" He was not available the first three times. 
The  fourth time I was able to get through to him.I started to speak to him, and before I was able to tell him about the problem I told him that I was recording the conversation, which I understand, I am legally obliged to do.
""Amrick,"" without letting me speak further became abusive, swore at me and rang off....
I should point out that like the previous reviewer the driver also swerved from side to side, drove excessively fast and it was a SUV..."

They have a tiny dining room, but you cannot sit there to eat at night, the guy told us : you are not supposed to sit there (the seats were empty)

Then we wanted to order sushis, and he told us the wait was 45 minutes. 
It was so rude that we did not even consider staying here. 
I ate here quickly for a lunch before, and had a better service. 
And to be told we would not get food before 45 minutes while we wanted to sit there and eat was very rude. 

It might be good for pick up. 
They do not take credit cards."

Not too impressed. Sloppy and rumpled front desk people proceeded to describe the facility by saying ""rich people come here!"" Huh? WTF? Locker rooms are laughingly small, and ridiculously inconvenient. One chair, zero room. It is literally cheek to cheek in there. Gross. I'd give them a C- in the cleanliness column. The pool has enough chlorine to peel a few layers of your skin off. Billing department is clueless, sending you bills 7 months later. 
Next round of PT wont be there.
One cool thing, they have treadmills on platforms that slowly lower into the water, elevator-like. As the floor goes down, and the water starts to rise its like being in a movie. I kept wanting to hear ""I expect you to die Mr. Bond."" as the water got deeper.

I have shopped at several other Super Walmart's regularly in my life and for some reason this one just feels crappy. People who haven't bathed in a month, homeless people, people in their PJs and the list goes on. I usually skip this one and go to the one in Monona.

Now my biggest complaint, the lighting! They're trying to be green with all new and natural lighting and I can't see a thing. Several other people I know have said the same thing."

I was even more excited when I went to the facility and saw the reasonably affordable rates and the  $20 date night options which includes pizza for the kids ($30 date night w/pizza for 2 kids).I am also please that they always work on a arts and craft project while they are there. Whenever we take our kids to Anytime kids they are never ready to leave which gives me comfort about the environment that we are leaving them in.

He was tireless in trying to find us our perfect home that we actually felt bad we were dragging him around to see three houses a day across two counties for weeks. Not only did he actively listen to our  requirements, but he also remained part of the process when we went under contract and was instrumental in making sure the mortgage underwriting process kept moving swiftly. He was also very honest and transparent and would point out potential issues with some of the houses we saw; his main concern was to see us happy in our new home as opposed to making a quick sale. We highly recommend Marcel and Alterna Real Estate the next time you are looking for a house!"

The waitress would not being me a salad with olives on the side so I could split it with someone and our Pizza sat on the counter for 2 or 3 minutes waiting to be delivered to our table and they were not busy at all.

They cut their hours and are now open from 10:00 to 1:00 and then from 2:00 to 4:00 on weekdays. The hours are silly and not very convenient for us with regular jobs.

I parked at the very last pump and there is a creep digging through the trash for God knows what.. he is eyeing my purse sitting in the car as I fill up. My window is down, so I put my window up and lock the door as I continue. 

Then this guy in the next pump is yelling and calling himself an idiot cause he just spilled his coffee all over his seat. Lots things going on at once.

I pump 15 bucks worth and I get in the car and leave, only to look at my windshield and remember that I wanted to use the squeegee to clean it so I go to the other extreme of the gas station trying to get away from the creep at the trashcan.

As I am driving, I see some idiot employee power washing the concrete in between the pumps..So I end up at at the far opposite side from where I just was. I open my car door and slip and fall on my butt, because the concrete is still wet from the power washing the guy is doing at 10AM! WTF!? 
Can't they do that at 3am when no one is using the pumps!?

There were lots of people pumping  gas at 10AM, someone else is gonna fall and sue them, hopefully. I considered complaining to the manager or somebody but was so annoyed, by the entire experience. I will never go back there!"

I went there on Friday night and the restaurant was very busy. There were a lineup of people who were there for takeout. I ordered the chicken leg meal with some fries. It cost less than 10 dollars.

The chicken was okay similar to the BBQ chicken you get at Swiss Chalet restaurants in Ontario. The fries were mediocre and not very good.

Dr. Seiler isn't always there because he donates his time to clinic that helps underprivileged individuals. And the two times I had to go back when he wasn't there (once when my filling was sensitive and needed a pain Rx, and once when my temp crown fell off), the other dentist (sorry, can't remember his name) was just as friendly and professional.

My cut was very generic so nothing fancy so if you are looking for a basic cut or trim, this beats any super cuts/great clips. This is not a stylist by any means so don't come walking in there expecting product and shelves specialized haircare items. I think their abilities are somewhat basic in terms kinda of haircuts but it is a traditional type of place.

They brought the wrong dessert, and the bread in the sub was hard and overcooked.  There was practically no sauce on the sandwich despite my ordering extra sauce.  The food was also not hot but simply lukewarm.  

It's a shame when I had to call multiple times to ask about where my food is.  They really seemed to care less.  The woman who first took my order promised me excellent food in about 45 minutes.

Silk acrobatics, balloon animal making like you've never seen before, jugglers, hula hoopers, glass eater, magician, a guy walking around on stilts. Never a dull moment. There were also home brewers and a mixology station. 

All Ale featured breweries from across the southeast region. Notably missing: local Charlotte breweries. I was pumped to see Damascus Brewery there. A friend from high school runs that business in the tiny Virginia mountain town where my mama lives.

My favorite: Ass Clown. It was my first time having beers from them. Also, I giggle every time I hear or say the name. Hi, I'm a grown up. The habanero and oyster stouts were both amazing. Finally, a beer that actually does have some real heat to it. I can not wait to check them out in Cornelius. I was also a big fan of Urban Orchard from Asheville. You know me.. I'm sucker for a cider.

I loved having live entertainment. Don't get me wrong, a DJ and/or band... great. However, the addition of the circus performers kept me entertained for six hours.

This branch is convenient if you're in the Metropolitan/Target area just outside of uptown. It's also close to the Farmer's Market, so if you are over there and forgot you need cash here's your savior. 

I rarely go inside this location, but the few times I've been in here the workers are all really nice. Granted, I go during off-peak hours, but it's never really busy or a long wait. The ATM is not a drive-thru, so you do have to get out of your car to use it. I'm always super paranoid about this and try to only visit this ATM during business hours. I watch a lot of SVU and I'm pretty sure it's convinced me that I'll be kidnapped one day.

We went through the drive through at nearly 11 p.m and there were a few other cars in the drive through. Service was ok, and we moved through the line pretty quickly, but man... Is it me or is KFC going down the wayside for taste?? The taco bell was still the same horrible for me style that I love, and I'd come back for it, but the last couple times of KFC have been downright disappointing. The biscuit was hard and tasted funky, and the chicken itself was very gristly and just not that familiar flavor that kept me coming back. The prices seemed to be a bit higher too... I think I'll venture elsewhere for my late night cravings."
rSlRme1T_RRH1ORg_YyVjQ,NNGGFg1Q6Ig0vIAYGxJxoA,"Hands down one the worst places I have ever lived. The apartment complex itself is decent, but the service is extremely horrible. 

Upon moving in they tell us that the apartment is cleaned and carpets are cleaned and vacuumed and shampooed, but they lied because we found dirt and junk from the past residents in corners behind drawers and beds. 

I've lived with CHT for the past two years, the first time in a different apartment and that place had rats. When I called to complain, they did nothing about it. 

Now, at the Roundhouse, requesting service is extremely slow and we have to make constant reminders to get them to fix our things. The divider between my roommates bedroom and I cannot even be fixed because they said they don't have those anymore. 

I'll let that slide. But the one thing I will not let go is the treatment they have give us. CHT staff are extremely rude and even yelled at my mom last year when she called in to complain. They make accusations and are liars. One staff claimed that there was a report filed from our neighbors about noises in our apartment, then another staff said no, someone saw animals in our apartment. They constantly give us attitude when we call them with our questions and concerns. The least you can do is provide good customer service, and these people can't even do that. 

When I called to ask about apartment showings (because they were showing our apartment) just to ask what times and if we can get notified with appointments and not just general forms of notification, the first thing they said was ""what are you hiding in there?"" This is extremely rude. They did not try to accommodate to us or try to understand our concern. All I asked was a simple question. I had flowers delivered to me one time as a surprise from a friend. The lady in the office said ""we don't hold flowers in the office"" as she rudely hands me the flowers. 

Each year they raise the prices of their apartments, and I am telling you all DO NOT SIGN WITH CHT. It's NOT worth it."

I came in here for a quick bite and picked this restaurant out of three or four available options because I felt like having jerk chicken.  The chicken was good, moist and flavourful.  Where it lacked is on the sides.  I asked the server that I will be dining in and don't want any rice and would rather have some salad.  I was given a take out tray with chicken and half full of coleslaw which is found inappropriate.  They also don't provide you with knifes unless you ask for it.

Breathtakingly beautiful and practical at the same time. The owner is a lovely young man who is happy to explain about the different quality, origin of and the use of his merchandise. Two months ago they opened Medina Palace, much bigger store a few shops south to the original one (and now they operate both).

I love that the classes are smaller (max 30 ppl). Mat distance is usually 20 inches or so. The instructors I go to all pay attention to little details & will adjust our postures if needed. 

What I love most about YT is the freedom & opportunity to challenge ourselves. Many variations are always given. With time, you will feel yourself improving with every practice.

The studio is also beautifully maintained w/ great staff & instructors. What more can a  yogi-wannabe ask for?

This Ace though, they are very helpful, every time I have ever gone in there. Today I was there to buy stuff to put an above ground pool up that I had just bought. So I needed a tarp, sand, chlorine and a few other thing. I wish I had got the gentlemans name, but he was so helpful. He walked around the entire store with me, showing me everything I needed, doing math, figuring how much of this I needed, etc. GREAT service!! 
The only thing bad about this shopping trip was that I purchased a new propane tank and then found out they had none. On Memorial Day weekend. Uh ohs. They gave me my money back and told me Frys would have it. That was another trip I really didn't want to make, but it turned out to be ok because I wanted cucumbers and asparagus.  
All in all, I will keep going back. There prices are also way better for chlorine, tarps and propane then other places I shopped at. There propane price is $7 less than the Ace off of Scottsdale Rd next to the post office."
Hz_h5of8tqBWY8Ch4qFQ-w,r0hPqHL0frC4XFXvYQCrww,"Do not trust this management company!!  We rented a house through him for 5 years.  We loved the house.  And, we even met the owner of the house, who was wonderful.  But, the owner of this management company, John Bailey, is as the other reviewer said...not looking out for either the owner or the tenant.  He got things done for us, as far as maintenance requests but with as little communication with us as possible. He totally lacks any type of people skills. Upon moving out of the house at the end of June, we had scheduled a specific time to do the walk through with him.  He never showed up for our appointment.  And, when we called him after waiting almost an hour, he said that he had not had the appointment written down on his calendar and was not going to be able to make it.  So, we were unable to do a walk through with him, as we were scheduled to leave the next morning.  We cleaned that house thoroughly.  My husband cleaned the oven so well that you could have eaten off it!!  Over a month later, we finally received our deposit money back but only 23% of it. We were charged ridiculous amounts for painting and touch ups to walls, on top of other charges - some indicated as miscellaneous (with no details).  We lived there for 5 years.  Part of an owners' responsibility, I would think, would be to repaint walls after a tenant has lived in the house for that long.  That should not be a renter's responsibility!  After we communicated to John that we were unhappy with how much of our deposit was kept, he subsequently sent a revised invoice to us, indicating that we actually OWED him more money...for issues that were discovered after he had already issued the first check. We feel cheated and robbed from.  We were reliable tenants who paid our rent on time every single month.  We always notified him of issues going with the house.  We did our part.  But, he has failed to do his!  Stay away from having to do business with this man at all costs!  It will cause you unnecessary stress and frustration!!  All I can do to feel at peace at this point is to hope that karma comes back around  one day to bite him in the butt!!!"

hDShad2FUvB1cvmGakIWHg,CqSxRncjuWAyZ6z9c8z1bQ,"Expect extremely poor quality bulk triple mix from this place. (Triple mix is supposed to be a rich loam comprised of topsoil, peat and manure for growing plants--the idea is you're paying for materials that enrich your soil to optimize growing conditions. From Islington Nurseries you can expect instead a mix of wood chips, stones and some soil--very poor for growing.) 

We're avid vegetable gardeners. Many years ago the Evans location used to carry very rich triple mix for delivery, but a few years ago I ordered triple mix for my father and was stunned to see a shipment of very poor quality mix that consisted largely of mulchy shredded wood chips mixed in with some soil and lots of stones--definitely not triple mix, and certainly not good for growing garden plants. (Wood mulch in soil changes the pH, can disrupt bacterial/fungal dominance which leads to plant decline, disrupts carbon/nitrogen levels which affect garden yield, and can cause numerous other undesirable effects.) I complained multiple times and didn't have any response from the local manager on Evans; I ended up complaining to the head office and finally asked to speak with the company owner, who told the manager to send a fresh new yard of triple mix to my father, which we appreciated. 

This year we thought we'd try them again, thinking maybe the previous bad batch was a one-off accident. So, my husband ordered triple mix and mulch for our garden. I came home to find once again that the triple mix was CHOCK FULL OF WOOD CHIPS, and also contained stones (and this not an accidental blending with the mulch they delivered--the triple mix was clearly a deliberate mix of mulch and soil). It's too late for me to do anything about it since my husband went ahead and topped our vegetable garden beds with this garbage. So in effect we paid to weaken the quality of our garden soil.  

(Incidentally, I'm not talking about the triple mix in bags--this is about their bulk mix delivered by the yard.)

Never again! As people who have long been in the gardening business, they should know better than to sell such poor mix to their customers."

Recently, I went there with the intention of trying their food because I love Mexican food. When I first stepped in the door, I should have heed the warning/sign. On the side of Sultan's Grill, the place was packed and there's a long line of customers. However on the Mcken's Mexican Grill side, I didn't see any customer even though it was during lunch hour rush. 

Their menu is a little bit confusing and their ordering concept doesn't make any sense. I think they wanted to following Chipotle ordering method but for some reason, it doesn't work here.

Anyway, I ordered a rice bowl and some tacos and were sorely disappointed. For almost $10 rice bowl and almost $9.00 for 3 tacos, the meat portion is terribly tiny. The meat and food were mushy and are just plain ""not good"". I know there are at least 2 great places within 3 blocks radius that serve great tacos at lower prices.

kWSDXcE4U43Eqa2pf0iFeQ,v7VIOXmiYNObQ9bmbLYBgQ,"I inherited a little money and wanted to do something for myself, I always hated my jowls and my sagging jaw line.  I was only 50.  I had remembered this place from the commercials so I called and set up an appointment.  I wasn't given the run around, it was all very professional - in fact I felt I had made the right decision.  The days leading up to the surgery .. and it is surgery, please don't forget that, I prepared my face as instructed and was ready.  The day of the surgery I got a ride and waited to be called, when I entered the ""surgery suite"" I should have listened to my gut and ran - it looked like a dentist's area not a sterile surgical area at all, I believe I was still in my street clothes.  I went in despite my foreboding and was given something to put me out like dream sleep or some other product not really anesthesia.  I woke toward the end just  before the abrasion procedure to my forehead (my gift with purchase) it hurt so bad, despite my moans and moving the doctor (Wood, I think) never stopped.  With my heavily bandaged face - so much for going back to work in a few days-  I went home and had a friend help take care of me and my incisions for a few days.  I did everything by the book...spent $250 for their skin cleansing system, phisoderm, clean bandages and cleaning per the times they stated.  After one week the area around the back of my ears were getting really red.  I went in to have them look at my face and waited like two hours watching people come and go (plus another woman with same complaint as I) and taking to people in the waiting room, one a nurse husband who all said it looked infected.  Since the incision areas are mainly behind your ears it is hard to see the area without some moving of tender areas of the ears.  Anyway the staff said they were not infected, continue with my cleaning and get the 2nd round of antibiotics.  The areas continued to get redder and larger in area.  I called and spoke to one of the staff who told me to take a photo and send it over.  I did as told, manipulating the camera for the best shot only to find to my horror that behind my earlobes were major open oozing wounds!  I sent over the pictures over the computer and they never called back.  I went to my doctor, who immediately sent me to the wound center at the hospital.  Despite the wound center's intervention my infection spread up to my temples, down my chin, and across the nape of my neck with streams of infection up into my scalp area.  I was diagnoised with staph and lost the hair at the nape of my neck for up to 2 inches of loss.  I suffered with pain, I was constantly having to change very gross bandages, couldn't sleep especially when weeping of fluids would seep down my face and neck literally soaking towels.  Needless to say I wouldn't go out in public.  That was 2 years ago and I can barely talk about it now....for only wanting to look pretty in my eyes, I have scars all along the side of my face, down my chin and back of my neck...I don't know what it looks like on my head where I didn't lose my hair but had infection.  The scars are indented, lumpy and discolored....I even suffer today as the scar areas develop pimple like eruptions and get infected all over again, gross stuff like white balls and rods come out of the infection which are very painful..people don't believe me so I have had witnesses put it in writing and have photos!  Today as I write this I have an infection on my left side chin under the ear lobe extending to mid neck, I rarely go out anymore and certainaly do not let people see my face.  The hair grows back but is so itchy that it is scratched out again and I have red pimple like your the worst pimple you had on your nose, all over the nape of my neck that are both painful, very red and itchy.  This is my life now - constantly dealing with eruptions on my face or deep scars that to go out need at least 4 applications of conceler and foundations.

PdBpq6fknpl1mL9MwXoF1A,9W2B1i_uf6QnjNRRx91DTg,"Very unhappy with her treatment of my wife.  She ran tests on my wife and realized she'd been over prescribing the dose of hormones my wife took for over a decade.  Her numbers were 5 times higher than they should have been.  Then the Dr. totally ignored the fact that her thyroid numbers were off.  She told her that she needed to go to pain management again.  Despite the fact that she had her go to Dr. D. Worden for 10 years for pain management.  She paid Dr. Worden $10k because insurance wouldn't cover her because she was a homeopathic doctor.  But she couldn't afford her anymore abd stopped seeing her 5 years ago.  At that time the 2 Doctors agreed that her meds were the right protocol.  Then the rude Dr. decided that since my wife didn't want to do pain management again, that she would no longer be her doctor.  She gave her 1 month of prescriptions and letter that said GO AWAY.  This doctor SUCKS.  POOR BEDSIDE MANNER.  We had decided to file a formal complaint.  My wife is now seeing a endo for the thyroid issue.  Hopefully the be Dr will be better than Levitt.  Her vitamin D was so low she was having cognitive issues.  So Dr. Levitt didn't care about my wife's health but was just trying to cover her ass because she was prescribing narcotics to my wife for her back pain and knew she was a medical marijuana patient."
FHvOvhUnuFfDv0j5gpqzRg,FLIwMkboBZRxFa-hYbbsHw,"This place is a hidden gem in path. I was referred to Dr Glen Partnoy to do a root canal bcoz my tooth situation was complex and my dentist was not confident enough to do it. I thought the procedure was going to be long and nasty. Believe it or not, it was actually quite enjoyable. Unlike other dentists, he explained what he was going to do before each step. I felt much more comfortable when I knew what exactly the doctor was doing to me. The procedure was done neatly and painlessly before I even realized. 
When I felt painful in my gum around that tooth 6mth later, I called the office and the receptionist was very nice to book me a consult on the same day. The assistant took the X-Ray free of charge. Dr Partnoy explained my X-ray thoroughly and confirmed my bone healed well. He advised me to get a crown instead of the permanent fillings, which was the same reason as what I expected.  
The team is absolutely professional and I would recommend here to anyone who needs to do a root canal."

oyxaoiho0tghLmQQMCa_5w,dufdhu3pGr5knm1BeEBxLg,"I have had a Harmony home for just under 3 years now. I have to say firstly that I love my home layout. However aside from that the level at which they are will to cut corners to build a home quickly is ridiculous. Since I have had the home I have repeatedly complained about the upstairs AC. The representative harmony sent the first summer said that is was normal for the upstairs to be warmer and looked no further the next summer I again complain and they stated that it was out of warranty and to contact a AC repair company. I did and they simply refilled Freon and did not check for leaks (admittedly this is my fault). This past year I contacted another AC company Legacy Air (great company by the way) and they find a pipe that had not been welded at all in my attic. I contacted Harmony homes to at least assist in the financial damage since this was negligence on their part. Costing me $800 and roughly 21 lbs of Freon leaked in my attic (over the years). Also, when I went into the attic/crawl space there was a bunch of trash a bottles left behind from the builders. The final time the Harmony home warrant department denied me they did even give me the courtesy of a call they just text, which to me seems very unprofessional. That aside I had repeatedly asked them to repair my balcony rail which looks like it had been dragged behind the truck prior to installation. They kept telling me they would send someone to paint it an they never did. almost 3 years now. Admittedly I only asked three time but it should be more than one. I should have took it as a sing this was a bad company since they were even willing to show the home to me prior to sale in that condition. I just don't want anyone else to fall prey to them. When you spend so much money on a home you want piece of mind everything is functioning properly and not waiting for something to go wrong."

6spBxiPv7cq3Zy0gSeQsEQ,uWSnbKDav2Tdcy-Z91bixA,"This apartment complex doesn't seem to have many recent reviews, so I figured I'd help with that...

We just moved from Chicago, and so far our experience here has been excellent. The management and maintenance staff are professional and courteous, with all requests handled in a timely manner. You can tell they go to great lengths to keep the grounds really clean, and communication on what to expect in the near future is the best of any place we've ever lived (and that's a LOT of places)! Even living in clusters, there is little to no noise from neighbors.

There are only 2 downsides so far. There is no recycling program, which is incredibly rare for both an apartment community and, from what I can tell, Avon itself. The other is the renovation aspect of the units. They are clearly undergoing a big rehab project, but it is being done piecemeal, which is kind of strange. For example, our unit had brand new floors, carpet, and appliances when we moved in (awesome!), but the cabinets are old, dirty, and ready to fall apart. Actually one door did fall right off. The door handles are all old and chipped, and the garage didn't even get a fresh coat of paint before renting switched to us. Our walls likely didn't either, because the bathrooms both bleed yellow every time we take a shower, likely from previous smokers...though it doesn't actually smell. These all would have been easy fixes. In my opinion, had they renovated the whole thing, they could've charged more AND it would've looked 100% beautiful instead of just partially. Hey, I guess I save on rent that way, so I won't complain too much, but perhaps that's a recommendation for the future. All in all, of the many places we've lived, Villages at Avon ranks pretty high on our list. It's a lovely, quiet, clean community with incredibly nice neighbors and staff."
PUMLHuoP1CiJttaY-yQPXw,C7f2TNZ-oAXnLneZx4YyTg,"Six months ago, our hot water heater died one cold night in February.  When I called Jim Dickerson Plumbing in the morning, they were able to replace the unit that afternoon.  Although they may not have claimed to be the least expensive in the area, they were able to provide same day service in an emergency situation.  Also, they provided a few case scenarios over the phone to tell me why the competitors cheaper 'quotes' might be such low estimates and that the end result may be a higher price.  What they provided over the phone already took into account certain additional items, assuming no major problems, so we'd have less of a surprise bill in the end.  Therefore, we went with Jim Dickerson Plumbing and were quite pleased with the service.  Just last week, the water heater began working incorrectly.  All issues related to the heater pointed to the manufacturer, not the plumber.  After numerous service calls, reordered parts, and additional problems spanning almost a week with the manufacturer, Jim Dickerson Plumbing came through with excellent customer service, same day service calls in each situation, and technical expertise.  In the end, the majority of this was handled on a Saturday.  I realize the business has 'on call' office staff and technicians, but we feel they went above and beyond their duties to ensure our house had hot water THAT DAY after the debacle we had experienced for almost a week.  Again, we seemed to get a 'lemon' of a product, by no fault of Jim Dickerson Plumbing.  The manufacturer ""State"" was horrible in providing assistance or solutions or accurate information to Jim Dickerson.  The plumbing company, on the other hand, transported an entire water heater to my house to use for 'spare parts' if need be.  The technicians [all of them that had been to our house:  Branden, Clayton, Cooper, Jason] and Marti and Debbie in the office were great.  Marti spent a lot of effort and energy trying to determine why the manufacturer did not deliver what was promised so that Jim Dickerson Plumbing could continue to do their job as they promised.  Not only was she diligent, but she was very empathetic and that helped us remain calm in a very frustrating situation.  We will recommend them highly whenever the opportunity arises."

4VB-AmekvX3SXk2I2qVn6Q,cUwH23l-fe8rv8bpLu-6wg,"On Saturday, June 21st 2014, I attended an auction in Newport Beach Ca. ""Piece of the Past""  was there as well selling memorabilia from their collection. The auctioneer ( I think was Mr. Martin, CEO) attempted to transform the auto auction into a Klan Rally. He used his platform to give his personal opinion about the President of the United States, Barrack Obama.  One of his pieces for sale was a photo taken at the White House of all the Living Presidents.  His comments included: ""you folks don't have to adknowledge Obama's photo in the picture. You can use it as a dart board, and throw darts at it. Am I right folks?"" He then when on to say. ""You see how much he screwed up this enconomy and country?""  There were several more comments made.

The room of nearly 300 customers fell silent. It was a very uncnfortable few moments. And I was not uncomfortable; I was upset. I did not get up, drive to Newport Beach (50 miles) to hear this uninformed person who obviously did not know his audience make inapproiate comments in this particular forum. This was not the NRC.

Before his rant, I'd auctally purchased one of his pieces of artwork.  And when I picked up the piece, I took the opportunity to express my dissatisfaction about the non professonal approach he displayed. His response was ""this is a free country and people shouldn't get so upset about comments made towards Obama just because he's black."" 

He's 100% correct, this is a free country and we can express our thoughts; and here are mine:

 - Anyone with a fifth grade education understands this government is set up so no President has total control of the country. 

 - Most of the memorabilia you were selling that day were of celebraties of people that supported Mr. Obama. Did you share those political  thoughts with them before asking them to sign your photos; are they idiots as well? 

 - And lastly, I watched as people bid hundreds of thousands of dollars on automobiles they don't need and most likey will never drive.  The function was held at a very exclusive location with yachts, multi-million dollar homes and people that appreared to have more money than time.  There was clearly no one suffering due to what you describe as a horriable economy. 

Stick to want you know; selling the works of talented people and leave the commentary to the cables networks."

I was there for the Cataracs concert, and I was extremely turned off by the unfriendly staff. Understandably, it was a busy night, but I expected a certain standard of hospitality that the Segredo staff just did not exhibit.

I work as the Receptionist for business that heavily uses Blizzard for our local & GTA courier needs and I couldn't be happier as I'm the first person contact for anything courier related. Bob and Frank are communicative, accommodating and sweet as pie. They are quick to fix problems and are amazing at following up when clients are not home to sign for packages.

They also have a very user friendly online courier request service (done through a web url through your internetz).

Things to watch out for:

If you send 2 different packages to the same address under 2 separate courier requests, their billing service will charge you twice.

The online courier request service has the option to get a signature from the recipient, OR ""leave in mailbox"" - Blizzard calls every single time to notify me when a client is not home and ALWAYS waits for clearance to leave packages unattended when I check mark ""signature required""

In general, great courier company for mid-big sized businesses! Happy to have been working with them through my firm for 4 years"

The ammo can be expensive. Good to practice a little before deciding which one is right for you. 
The staff suggested after getting our own firearm, we can become a member. That may be more affordable to us."

JQiUQiojYfRlEPT1JzfnwQ,emFFLLncRBFGiUJT1n6U_Q,"Rent Champaign is a rental property company that rents out a variety of houses and apartments in the Champaign/Urbana areas.  

We have been renting from them for 2 years, but our experience has definitely not been positive.  Rent Champaign's biggest flaw is with their leasing/office team, who time and time again has made empty promises, forgotten about important calls/emails sent to them, and shoved early renewal requests and prospective tenant visits to our rental home well before our lease was over.  

If anything, Rent Champaign only seemed to care to the most urgent of our needs (like no heat, leaking pipes), but ultimately never would come through with their other ""promises"" for maintaining the rental home.  On the plus side, the Maintenance team is very good, but there is a big disconnect between the office team and the maintenance team, as in the office team not relaying the work that needs to be done to the maintenance team.  Rental Prices are also pretty good.  Best way to compile my two years of renting would be a pros/cons list.

Pros:
- Fairly nice rental properties, ranging from houses, apartments, condos, and more.  Most properties are up to date with modern appliances and central air.  
- Good prices for the area.  
- Maintenance team is friendly, prompt, and professional.
- RentChampaign was good about responding quickly to emergency needs (like no heat, leaky roofs, flooding, etc)

Cons:
- No flexible leases (they were very strict about 9-12 month leases only)
- Incessant bothering to renew our lease for the next year well in advance.  My first year renting we started getting bothered 10 months (we pretty much just moved in!) in advance, the second year we were getting bothered 8 months in advance... 
- If you don't agree this early on a lease renewal, RentChampaign schedules frequent showings of your property and you could very well lose out on your lease for the next year if you don't commit so soon in advance.  This alone was a huge bother to us, and we didn't like having to show our ""home"" to new people every other week or so for months on end... (surprisingly the ""prospective tenants"" never ended...)
- Tons of empty promises from office staff.  Before we moved in, the previous renter has neglected many of the aspects of the property.  RentChampaign ""promised"" they would be fixing all of these things before we moved in.  Lo and behold, none of the things they promised has been addressed when we moved in.  In fact, it took them several MONTHS and us bothering them about it to do some of them, and till this day many of their promises were never done... we lost the will to keep bothering them about it!  All and all, you let them know about an issue, they say they will fix it right away, but then they never do, and only the most vigilant renters and constant reminders seem to be able to finally get the company to take the action they already said they would do.  


All and all, I would not rent from RentChampaign again, nor would I recommend them.  The properties and prices are nice, but the company is negligent with their promises and the whole ""you got to renew your lease 9 months in advance"" thing was uncalled for.  Likewise, it was frustrating dealing with the visits a few times a month from prospective tenants.  We didn't like it at all.  So for those considering RentChampaign, be wary... they do everything they can to make everything seem perfect, but as the saying goes, sometimes things are too good to be true.  It's not been a terrible experience, but RentChampaign falls short in so many categories."
-lbSMzyJ9vonB4I0ltlFsg,qieTzInVfI1SyP1eVxQqWA,This saddens me to write as I have great experiences until now. It most likely is for new staff. However found fraudulent billing . Very disappointed. Unfortunately honesty is not their mission and it shows in their practices and behaviors. I guess everything happens for a reason. I am not sure if doctor Stewart is aware as the woman billing is different than him. But I valued him and trusted him. He is kind and always concerned and flexible when I am with him. I find it unlikely that he is aware of what is occurring. It may be because the staff needs more training. It makes me sad. But best wishes to all and I hope your experiences are better than mine.

It is about 20 minutes from downtown which allows for easy travel with the perks of being near the city. The hotel itself was clean with friendly staff. The check-in process was very easy. The room was spacious and had all the basic amenities, however, the walls are extremely thin which means that we could hear people at all times (even from the lobby). The breakfast was subpar. There was yogurt, waffle iron, oatmeal, etc. The eggs and biscuits were cold and seemed old. Overall, the price seemed fair for the amenities offered and the service was good but the thin walls were very disturbing at night and early morning."

When it was my turn I was helped promptly and with a smile and a apology for my wait. Artie gave excellent service and was able to notarize my item quickly and with ease. I paid 5$ for one signature if you need more then one it is 2$ for each additional. I definitely recommend this place!

We get there at open (10pm) and there was literally no one else there. We decide to go back home, have a few drinks, and come back when the party was started. Get back at 11pm and the place is wall to wall dudes, and nobody dancing. My friend and I hit the floor for about 20 minutes before realizing that everyone else was too scared to join us, and that the club is definitely not at the hype level that M.I.A. warrents. 

Go and ask the cashier; that's the name of the concert. M.I.A. is not paying.

I wish I could upload the poster so you could see how deceptive it was. We left and didn't come back.

Employees were all great though."

I'm the type to Not take  my business when I'm treated like the way I was. I never ask for refunds and I'm still not asking for a refund. 11/12/16 I took my vehicle in for a alignment they didn't have much business and told me it will take 2 1/2 hours. I was fine so I had my buddy pick me up and take me to work. I paid them in full before I left even though a hole in the wall shop that does the same work did a better job on a much older vehicle. For half the price mind you that the older vehicle that had better work done to it was a 1997 and he vehicle they worked on is a 2015 with about 10k miles on it. I see things as you get what you pay for. Didn't even want to bargain with these people he ""Josh"" said a price I said ok np! I sent my buddy to pick up my vehicle and was charged $25 for shop supply.  ok wasn't informed but that's fine. When I drove my car it was much worse than when it was dropped off. Mind you I just put brand new pirelli tires the day before. So I give them a call this morning not asking for a refund or a discount only bcus I'm not that type of person. If a business burns me once I just never go back. I've never texted a person a message this long in my life. And for me to write this much about a local business really means they pushed me to do it. ""Josh"" so as I was saying I called and asked to talk to the manger and he was like can I help you with a ugly tone and told him what my problem was and he said to me ok and.. I said never mind I'll just bring the car there he said no! We close at noon and I called at 10am drive by at 1020 they didn't have any cars in there bay I'm actually a local business owner with a much bigger clientele and wanted to support local businesses. If he would of said to me sorry can you bring it in Monday I would of ben fine. Even if he said can you bring it in, in 3 months I would of. But he wanted to be a jerk and made me go through with this long message very agitating..  I asked do you test drive the vehicles he said yes and I asked they didn't notice that I dropped it off bcus it moved to the right just a lil and now it moves to the right 3xs more than it did. He had no answer thanks Josh. I'll be sure to send the customers that come by my shop that do nothing but complain. If yelp had a negative 5 star It still wouldn't be enough to define them with. Oh and they charged me to center my steering wheel at 1:00 to the right when it was straight when it was dropped off. Never have I ever gave a review this long. I'll go back to the hole in the wall that will do a much better job for half the price."

Lockers and sauna areas were very nice and clean, relaxing. That was a major plus, to be able to relax and unwind after your stay in Toronto. It did have a lingering smell of marijuana in some of the corridors, and the floors were slippery (either it's lube or water from the saunas).

She went over my teeth and made a couple of suggestions and told me my teeth were very good but I should floss,  come in more ect.  

The best part and what would always stick in my head is her chair.  It give me a message and it felt good I did not want to leave the chair and if it was for her hands in my mouth I could have.   ( double points for the chair).

I usually by the Taste of the Wild brand of dog food. It's the bison formula and it has no grains in it so no fillers, preservatives and colors. My dogs love it!!! They always lick the bowl when its empty to taste every crumb. It makes their coats very shiny and they have so much energy. 

Their cat food selection is just as good and they have other animal needs like for cats, fish and even hamsters or rabbits. Whenever you first come in the  store there are pet rabbits that they keep behind the register. This one rabbit is about 9 lbs. It's huge like a cat!! They have it in its own little cage for shoppers to peek at. The fish selection they have isn't too bad, its not Elmers of course but a lot better than some of the mainstream places. 

I spend about $100 a month on dog for $50 for a 30 lb bag and the since I have two large breed dogs and they each eat about 5 to 6 cups of food a day. They each go thru a bag a month. Taste of the wild is one of the only dog foods that my pups can eat without breaking out or having diarrhea. 

So if your looking for a small but detailed shop that has better and more natural food choices along with a great selection of rare pet products."

Their produce how is really small and they don't offer a lot of organic products either.  I believe they only have one shelf designated for organic produce compared to a whole room full of all other fruits and veggies. 

I feel the entrance to the store is far too small. Every time I walk in there I have to look out for somebody coming around the corner with the buggy or a family of people and you have to squirm your way through. And then the counter where people buy lottery tickets and cigarettes it's always full too. 

The floor in the produce section is new and up-to-date but the rest of the store looks very old. There are a few items that you can buy over-the-counter besides medicine and of course the bakery and deli but they don't have a fresh meat counter. I don't understand how you don't sell fresh meat but you sell fresh seafood, and the seafood counter is extremely small smaller than the bedroom.

I'd rather skip the store and go to the nicer giant equals like the one in Monroeville Shadyside and Robinson. This line is just far too small, far too limited and honestly it's kind of ghetto. I honestly only shop here when I really need to get something but as far as actual grocery list shopping I never go here."

JQiUQiojYfRlEPT1JzfnwQ,YyDOf6W6xjwVnX19bR2b6A,"We rented from RentChampaign for two years. The price was good, and the property was okay. It wasn't the cleanest when we moved in, and some things were falling apart, but that was a compromise for us due to the low rent. The management was friendly for the most part, but seemed to change pretty often. By the time we left I didn't know any of the people working in the office.

As I said, rent was pretty reasonable, and only increased by $5 or $10 per year, which is about what I expect. They paid for sewer and trash. They charged a pet deposit rather than pet rent, which I appreciated. The lease terms overall were pretty reasonable. We did get bothered pretty far in advance to renew both years, however.

Maintenance requests usually took awhile to be responded to and acted upon, but they always got done. Done right? Well, that's another matter. Their fixes usually looked to be on a budget. The grounds were well-kept, except the parking lot which was kind of a hot mess.

All in all, they were an okay company to rent from, until they sold the building to Ramshaw Real Estate (i.e., the worst company to rent from) with almost no prior notice. Thanks for throwing your tenants to the wolves, RentChampaign."

I am a fan of circus, particularly the intense physical capability of the performers and intricacy of the acts involved. I'd learned about MCS a couple of years ago and have been in love with their mission ever since. 

You don't have to be a member to take classes, but membership gets you 24/7 access to the space (with natural light, sprung wood floor, and 22-foot ceilings) among other benefits.

I've attended an adult tumbling class, which was a blast. The instructor was knowledgeable and fun, and it was really interesting to get back onto the tumbling mats as an adult. All skill levels were accepted. I'm curious about hooping, juggling, and acroyoga. 

I believe the available classes will vary based on whether there is a member willing to instruct, and the space may also be available as a teaching space once certain membership standards have been met (if you're able). No matter the class, you'll sign a liability waiver before you begin, and of course should take any physical limitations into consideration. The current class listing includes: Introduction to Trapeze; Acroyoga; Lyra Fundamentals 1-2; Silks Fundamentals; Beginner 1 & 2 in Aerial Silks; Aerial Yoga; Beginning Hoop Dance; and German Wheel.

For kids, they offer ""Circus After School"" (after-school survey of all things circus, including aerial arts, juggling, physical comedy, tight-wire, stilt walking, acrobatics, German wheel and more! Kids ages 7 and up), and ""Monkey School!"" (A fun, movement- and imagination-based introduction to circus arts for 4-6 year olds. Kids will explore tumbling and acrobatics, aerial arts, balancing, clowning and more! For the after-school, can't-sit-still crowd).

The space also accommodates the following clubs: German Wheel Club; Madison Area Jugglers; Table Tennis; and Hoop Dance.

In addition, there are two major entertainment events that I can recall off the top of my head. Their annual Mad Circus Gala is held in November (the 2nd annual in 2015 was at the Barrymore Theater) and the Skeleton Circus in March. I've attended the latter, in 2016, and while it is indeed 'skeleton' with minimal setup and held in the practice space, it was a lot of fun. They do have good lighting, and the rigging from their ceilings allowed me to see everything except floor work from the folding chairs they'd set up. Both events raise money for MCS (nonprofit) and for their scholarship program, available ""for community members who demonstrate financial need and interest in the circus arts.""

In the win column we have a space completely focused on increasing interest in physical activity and performance; building community, skill, and appreciation for the circus in youth and the area at large; and offering education and FUN to all who chose to enter their doors. As far as Madison options go, I feel that what MSC offers beats out your average gym."

Make sure you take your big piggy bank with you before you stop by there.Follow up my check engine light is still coming on for the same problem after spending $2400 am very disappointed about Scott jaguar not doing the repairs the proper way the first 2 times. This is the 3rd time my car has been brought in for the same issues.

I bought the $5 KFC meal, 3 boneless chicken meal.  First of all, you'd think how cool, it's a $5 meal, what a steal!  The chicken is much smaller, the side dish is like 8 macaroni and the biscuit was a pebble.

But the absolute worst part about it was the fact that the chicken was incredibly salty.  No, like really salty.   After the meal, the sides of my tongue still felt like they had a lot of salt on it.  It's like they dropped the chicken into a salt vat after dousing it in soysauce, and THEN marinated in the Dead Sea (for you worldly knowledgeable peepz!)

Service was incredibly slow. Sister was flying in from Cedar Rapids, I'm pretty sure I placed the order before she took off and she still arrived before my meal.  She had a layover in Chicago too because of Barry.

Terrible.

I was quoted $340 to fix a leaky bathtub faucet, patch and paint a hole in the wall, replace and paint a broken door, re-caulk two bathtubs, and fix various broken drawers around the house.  The man who did the work, Evelio, was extremely competent, courteous and professional.  I always feel like i'm taking a gamble when it comes to using a business like this- you never know what you are going to get from a google search... but I guess I lucked out.  I would recommend Evelio at Homer the Handyman to anyone.  He truly knew what he was doing and made the work seem effortless.  The paint and texture of the patched hole in the wall matched perfectly and you couldn't even tell it was there.  The new door was perfect too.  No more leaky bathtub faucet either.  I was very satisfied with the work done and pleasantly surprised that I was only charged what I was quoted for the work and not a penny more, despite running into a few speed bumps in which Evelio was quickly able to adjust to.  I will definitely be calling Homer the Handyman again when the need arises!"

The worst massage ever!  Bought a 60 minute massage with a foot scrub. I arrived 12 minutes late, due to a wreck. I called the masseuse to let her know, but there was no answer. She called me back as I was parking.

I went to the room and filled out the paperwork. The massage started at 20 minutes after my appointment was scheduled and she told me that it will be done by end of the hour. She finished at 10 till the hour. 

I told her that I had a hand injury and the entire ""massage"" was on my injured hand and arm. 

With the exception of 7 to 8 minutes, the entire time was focused on my right injured hand and arm. I told her a couple of times that what she was doing was painful. Then she used some type of extremely abrasive "" lotion"" that amplified my nerve damage in my finger. I was given breathing instructions and told to turn my head 3 times to the left and then 3 times to the right. Not sure what that was about. 

She then went to my feet, that I had previously asked her not to do, so I told her to stop. Then to my left arm which lasted approximately 7 to 8 minutes.

As the grand finale, my left arm was rotated from beside my body to up , over and past my shoulder. I told her that that hurt and to stop. She advised that my session was complete.  I did not receive a full 60 minute massage.  

She then proceeded to tell me that there was a tip sheet on the table that would rate how she did.  The sheet was $20 for great, $15 for very good and $10 for good. None of these were even close.  Very unprofessional. 

I got dressed and left. I have no idea where she went. I contacted Groupon and received a reimbursement.  Note to self: Do Not go back.

This cell phone repair store located at a business park, which is a little bit hard to find but the owner, Steven said this is because they focus on quality and low cost repair. Their purpose is to save the money from location and lower the price to customers. They fixed my iPhone 6 in 30 minutes and only $69, plus I have the first time customer 20% off. So it is only $56! Besides that, Steven showed me my bad screen after screen replacement done, that is pretty interesting. 
Overall, great experience due to the price and time! Will recommend to other people!"

That said, their customer service is poor. You can expect a gruff greeting from these senior citizens and abbreviated responses to any questions, in the vein of ""duh, you didn't know that"". Then there's the personalized note on the invoice, that lets you know what was fixed, including what you did wrong. I was waiting for the manager to slap my hand with a ruler and set me in the corner.

After the mower repair, I took my edge trimmer in for the same service. Before I set foot in the doorway, I was virtually chased off the property because they don't work on trimmers.

2hnMN7vn3WfFTBb6trc8og,0yOIxGWTTgawsnrWgziplA,I had made plans to stop by this branch as it was the closest to our hotel before going out for the evening (2/14) in Las Vegas. The recorded business hours state they are open until 5:30 pm. I arrived to the branch right at 5:00 pm and was met with locked doors and employees inside the branch doing their best not to notice me. While the business hours at the door also state a 5:30 close there was a paper taped to the door indicating that the new hours would now be a 5 pm closing time. While I tried to call the branch phone number some of the employees began to exit. I asked if I could talk to one of the employees and explained that I had planned my evening feeling assured that I would be able to access my funds to get cash for the evening based on all advertised and recorded hours of operation. She explained that the new hours had begun just this week and that the recording takes a week to catch up. I asked if that was the known case then why didn't they adjust the recording last week. It was clear that my predicament would not be addressed at this branch and basically 'tuff luck'. The only alternative to access cash would be via my credit card with substantial fees or cab/Uber to another branch that was open later and hopefully hadn't changed their business hours with a paper note on the front door as well. As this was my first visit to this branch of US Bank I can only express how disappointing it was.

So many amazing options available to be tasted, with cost of admission. No need to buy tickets like other beer festivals I have been to. 
I especially loved Ass Clown Brewery - they had a great selection of sour beers to choose from, which are not easy to find. The aerial gymnasts were entertaining, as were the other side shows. Bathrooms were plentiful and the venue was way cleaner than I expected.

My only 2 (minor) issues with the day were: 
1 - you had to go out front to smoke, even though security was standing by back door as well. It was hot/stuffy in there, and I wanted fresh air ASAP! 
2 - no local food, Panda Express was set up there. Didn't think that was befitting of a beer festival, especially in a city with delicious & unique local restaurants and/or food trucks. However, the few booths inside with food (the pretzels & hummus), kind of made up for the lack of local cuisine."

We registered, we don't need to make a reservation and anytime my husband and I need someone to watch our 1 year old for a few hours we can drop by leaving our diaper bag, any snacks, special toys and instructions regarding meal time.  My husband and I have tried it twice with great success.  The first time we dropped our 1 year old off for two hours and scheduled a couples massage nearby.  When we returned our daughter was eating the snack we provided and had just completed an art project - adorable snow couple made with prints of her feet.  The second time we tried the parents night out special on Saturday (4 hours after 6pm for $20).  Anytime Kids provided pizza for dinner and again our daughter was happy, safe and content playing with the other children.  It works out great as a backup for our daycare needs and as a babysitter when needed.  Thank you Delisa giving me and my husband date nights again.

By6EWeG-Ldjt8GsGFSAYZg,1gCEez8WcRSm_yg_JrUjNg,"I took their part time French beginner's class for 4 month. My instructor was Maxime Trudeau-Poitras. I had a great time there and I did learn a lot in class. 

As of background, I had zero French background when I first started. I know only four French words/sentences before taking the class: oui, merci, bonjour and c'est la vie. During the class, I had a full time job which means I didn't have much time studying after the class. At the end of A4 class, I could have simple conversations in French to introduce myself and discuss what I did in the past and my plan in the future (within the topics that we had learnt and practiced in class). I am more comfortable in a French environment now. 

Maxime is an excellent teacher. If the school will see my post, I recommend you to give this guy a raise (I'm half joking!). He has many years of teaching experience. He was knowledgeable and was really patient with us. I talked to many classmates and we all feel really lucky to have him.

My class had a great vibe. People were all very engaged and we had some good discussions.  Also my class had a friendly environment. I did feel some pressure when moved into A2 class where we were required to talk more in French. However, classmates and Maxime gave me a lot of courage and I got use to speaking in French in my class (if it's outside class, I will still be nervous). If you are a beginner with zero background like me, you might be overwhelmed at first and I did struggled a little bit about if I should continue to the A2. But I am really happy that I stick with it. I think the class will be easier for those who had learnt some French in high school. But it is totally doable for people who have no background.

The class size changed from A1 to A4. In our first A1 class, we had like 20 people and in the end we had 5 people who completed A4. It works for me. Bigger class has better discussions and it was really fun. However, when you moved to higher levels, the smaller class size allows you to practice more and the instructor could spend much more time on each students. 

I did recommend my friends to give the class a try if they are interested in learning French."

Here are the highlights: painless injection, comfortable environment, nothing scary at all, great conversation. It felt like they've done it a million times. Now that the numbing has worn off, the area where they worked feels fine. I have no pain and look forward to the next visit. They did a fantastic job!"

I had never been to Crossfit before and despite having some experience with weight lifting previously, I was intimidated by the athleticism of their members and the complexity of the gym routines (WODs). 

Chris, Torrey and the other trainers were supportive from Day 1 of myself and my capabilities.  Each workout is scaled to my capabilities while still pushing my boundaries. During workouts, they will consistently adapt the routine to push you to the next level so that you are not stagnating. They also tend to encourage every single person during the workout, even in our largest classes. 

The members of PFD are also super supportive. They know your name and encourage you throughout the workout as well. I couldn't think of a better place to work out!"
wcXqGgZDlnyEyEmtEZ8-zw,FQsbJx12jvFYxzKy6RdPSw,"My wife and I got a delivery from here.  First, the order took over three hours for delivery.  They had problems with their driver breaking down, which I totally understand as stuff happens, but then it took another hour and half after we checked in for it to get here still.  This put a damper on the mood, yet we tried to stay positive, but then we tried the food.

To put it bluntly, and maybe it's because we waited over three hours: it sucked.  The cheesy bread we had gotten wasn't cooked through, it being doughy and there was semi-cooked flour crumbling off.  I understand the concept of hand tossed bread and crusts, like a New York style crust with little bit of flour still on the bottom, but this was just uncooked.  The pizza on the other hand was completely on the other end of the spectrum, where the crust was rock hard and flavorless, as though it was water and flour just mixed together.  Finally, we had gotten some nachos as an appetizer, and it was just crappy nacho cheese sauce, and no exaggeration on crappy.  7-11 has better cheese sauce for their nachos, and theirs isn't that good to begin with, just to give you perspective.  The chips themselves where white flour chips which tasted stale, and the ground burger meat was unseasoned, just raw burger thrown into a pan by itself  **NOTE** Tried the ground burger on the nachos by itself once more just to see if I was more upset and just taking it out, but the burger meat is actually old tasting, like it was out of date.

I generally give everyone the benefit of the doubt, but this was so horrible I don't think I'd even try them a second time.  From the service, the cooking, right down to the raw ingredients used, everything was not even sub-par, it was all just completely horrendous."

The restaurant looks over the lake and has gorgeous views!

I ordered the half fish and chips - London style. The half portion was huge! The fish was decent, but nothing special. Fries were nice and salty - kind of reminded me of a crispier version of five guys fries. The only issue was the Cole slaw - it was a vinegar style sauce, but for some reason it tasted off. Did not finish it. 

Hubby ordered the burger which was absolutely delicious. Nice fresh bun and plenty of veggies and a nice sized patty (greasy goodness!). It also came with Cole slaw that did not get eaten. 

A good place to stop by if you're in the area and reasonably priced (especially for us Americans with the exchange rate!)"

The owner (wish I could remember his name) was very patient as he made recommendations and brought out different styles to try out. During our conversation we mentioned that we were recently retired and we talked briefly about that and our move back to Ohio. Being in a league we were also given a discount. Imagine our surprise when we walked in today to purchase boards for the sponsoring bar and the first thing the owner asked was ""how's retirement""? We had another pleasant conversation and really appreciate his excellent customer service. Even though we have to drive quite a distance we won't go anywhere else...well worth the drive!"
eFF000MRzjxMNvIUJkRogA,JUT0U3HTSB3kz9Wh7N0GqA,"I was lucky enough to attend a high school that valued the performing arts just as much if not more than athletics. Then I was able to attend a classical BFA program and earn a degree in Acting (what were my parents thinking) when all my friends were studying to become lawyers, teachers and doctors. I graduated college and was a professional aaaaauuuuuditioner (heh, heh), then switched roles, moved into arts administration, and became a Company Manager for two different regional theatres, one in Chicago then one in Arizona. 

Why am I telling you this? 

Because I have a deep appreciation for the arts. No. A hunger. I know first hand how important and influential theatre, music and dance can be and I wish more people felt the same. The arts enable us to tell stories, to feel, to understand something about our selves we may not have been aware of before the house lights went down. And while you might not love everything you see, one thing's for certain: Art brings people together. It fosters dialogue and debate in ways television doesn't. 

And I wish more people agreed. 

Warning: Sweeping generalization coming at ya:

I don't think Madisonians support the arts as much as they support Packer football and crazy consumption of cheese curds. I can't tell you the number of people I meet that have never heard of Forward Theater and don't understand that their work is rehearsed and produced right here in Madison, not trucked in from somewhere. On the few occasions that I've partnered with them and raffled off tickets to see a show, I'm amazed that people aren't fighting tooth and nail for a free seat! Perhaps people are afraid of what they don't know? Well let's get you familiar.

Forward Theater is celebrating five years of sharing professional and exceptional comedic and dramatic work with the citizens of central Wisconsin. They hire Wisconsin talent when they can and supplement with exceptional theatre artists from surrounding areas. Their season is as diverse as the beer line-up at Old Fashioned and plays aren't any longer than a feature film, so while you might not like everything, there's enough variety that you're certain to spot something that moves you. Tickets start at $10. TEN DOLLARS! Can you see a movie for $10? And last up, this is their job, a crazy career path they've chosen. Yes, they do it because they like it, but it's more than just fun for them. It's a profession. It's a way of life. 

So far I've seen Sons Of The Prophet and Red, and while I didn't enjoy the former as much as the latter (more an issue with the script than anything else), I still enjoyed being a part of the evening. Because what happens when you go see a show is you say to Forward Theater and Overture Center, ""I support you."" And it shouldn't matter if the arts were an integral part of your upbringing, you can support live theatre because producing organizations like Forward support you, and they've created something they want to share with you.

A Facebook friend and freelance Madison-based Stage Manager had this to say yesterday:

""GO SEE A PLAY. There are lots of shows happening here in Madison and I'm sure there are lots wherever you are too. Save up a few dollars and go see some live theater. Theaters rely on ticket sales. We can produce better work with more money, people can improve their craft if they can make a living doing it, and dammit, it's awesome! It's not enough to just say that you support the arts, you have to go out and actually do it.""

I can't agree more."

Real dirty. 
I kicked Flo to the curb. 
I basically said after 8 years, ""F you Flo!"" 

Since February Am Fam has held the policy on my condo and today I made the giant leap, the giving up my first born sort of leap, and made Am Fam my sole insurer, divorcing myself from Progressive, bringing my auto policy to the friendly folks on East Wash. 

It was emotional. 

It was monumental. 

But in the end, it wasn't so bad. 

(I'm still waiting for Flo to call me and ask me why we broke up.)

Lisa who drew up my home policy in Feb is out of the office right now so Jenny hooked me up with a comprehensive auto policy that's no more than I'd be paying with Progressive AND I get a discount for bundling both AND they're right across the street from where I live AND they're human/real people AND they're more local than spotted cows. It just seemed like the right thing to do 365 days after my move to Madison. And if you're in the market for a super stellar staff and competitive rates, I highly recommend them!"

We stopped by on a Wednesday evening after an art show at the SAT. The place is cute, simply decorated and feels laid back

The cocktail list isn't as diverse as I thought it would be, with the reputation of Le Mal Neccesaire but if you have a drink in mind, the bartender will gladly make it for u. I don't drink beers so I can't speak for that but the beer menu looked pretty interesting! I ordered the Donde Mis Zapatos (lol!!!) and it was alright, not bad but nothing to write home about either.

We ordered the jerk cauliflower, the tandoori wings and roasted asparagus. I think the food was my prefered part, everything was very well seasoned and balanced in flavor. Deliciousness!!!!! 

I'd come back for some more food ya!"

I get my lashes done next door at Axiom Spa and I always hear their music through the walls. It seemed that Hidden Attic was a fun party place so I decided to check it out. I was really annoyed with the loud hip hop/rap music. The use one of those mega base portable boom boxes. It was obnoxious.  

I was not interested in buying or browsing too long and lost interest. I would love to spend more time browsing but I'm not 21 and at the club. 

I think this place has potential.  

Get a bit more stock.
Be more friendly to your potential customers.

Avoid rap and stick with top 40 music."

JuhbUwZRKoDsc1zACJGxxQ,5-hi0CmXQNE8pjZDBIEOIg,"Whaaat?  No love for Ange Ricky?  I'll have to fix this.

My boyfriend and I were a little unsure about the goat tassot, so Ange let us try it before ordering.  It was VERY slightly spicy.  Oh, and delicious.  It sounds a little funky, but it doesn't taste too outlandish.  The chicken was good too, but I was too sold on the goat.

I also got her vanilla lemonade.  I ordered it as a slush, which was way too good.  The only problem is that it had very large chunks of ice in it, which made drinking it awkward.  I'd suggest not getting the slush; just keep it simple and get it as a liquid.

I didn't like the plantains, though I'm a hard sell on that, since I don't like bananas much.  They were too hard and dry for my tastes.

Ange was also extremely sweet and welcoming.  Her personality alone could make this an enjoyable experience.  And just the goat and the lemonade would bring me back here in a heartbeat.  That is, if I didn't live in California."

SFSpGYEI-hrAQLvS3q4yyQ,Q8c2eJhAYTE4MrLX8aEOkQ,"I booked an appointment here hoping to get a nice pedicure before the holidays. When I entered (on time for my appointment) there were two girls working and no receptionist to greet me. 

When one girl noticed me and asked if I had an appointment, I said yes and she told me I could go pick a polish. I did that and then awkwardly pushed some stools aside to sit down and wait. 

15 minutes later, she brought over a bin with Luke warm soapy water and said I could start soaking me feet. So I switched seats to soak my feet and stepped on a pile of nail clippings on the way, which was not a pleasurable experience to say the least. 

After my feet had been soaking for over 15 minutes, someone came to to my pedicure.

Luckily the girl who did my pedicure was nice and apologetic about the half an hour I had waited- they were obviously understaffed. 

The manicure was done with care, but I really didn't feel that comfortable or welcome for that matter. With tax and tip it still came to 75 dollars. As a total experience I wouldn't say it was worth that, so it's unlikely that I'll be returning."

qvgo0I7j_BH_XRMxueO8Ag,dHF1L4KlTRSwY5CyK1XP6w,"I lived here for 1.5 years. I never had hot water in the kitchen, try rinsing off plates with cold water. I had to heat water on the stove and most of the time the water got too hot then I had to wait until it cooled before I could start washing dishes. What a hassle.

I never used the laundry room. It wasn't cooled with a/c, I was always concerned someone would steal my things and there wasn't anywhere to watch and wait for your laundry. It was messy most of the time.

The office has regular a/c put the apartments are an evaporative cooler system. The system has to be drained then they will turn on the heat when they want to, not when it's needed. The apartments are very damp because of the evap-cooler. Stay away if you have mold allergies.

I got along ok with the office staff but someone constantly would go into my apartment when I wasn't home. They put up 2 big 2 feet by 2 feet metal panels on the wall in the living area and in the walk-in closet. I still do not know what the plates were for. In the process they broke my very sturdy sleigh headboard and sanded the finish off in places, they even left the sandpaper on the stairs for me to see. Before I moved the headboard magically glued itself together.

I would come home to find different light bulbs in the range hood, lower wattage to save electricity.  The refrigerator seem to shut off at night time. My food was always spoiling in the frig much quicker than other places. So much for utilities included.

There was a huge mound of cement in one corner of the living area and the flooring wasn't glued to the subfloor. It appeared to cover a moldy spot. One day I noticed the cement was gone and the plastic flooring was glued to the subfloor. It must have taken short of a jackhammer to remove the cement and my cat had to live with all this coming and going without telling me they were going to be in my apartment. 

They did a million dollar restore on this place but it was just cosmetic. The paint on the cabinets would come off when they were wiped. The counter tops were covered with an epoxy coating. I had to leave my apartment when they were installing the coating in an apartment behind my apartment on the first level. I lived in a studio apartment on the second level. It just shows how you will get odors and sound from the neighbors.

I left this apartment in much better shape than when I moved in and they are trying to get me to pay $60 for a clean-up fee. I would never rent here again. I am so much happier now that I moved from the area. It was starting to concern me because the area was becoming unsafe. I noticed when I was looking for a new place that this area had several rapes listed on the Phoenix police crime history site. I'm a single woman and having so much activity in my apartment when I wasn't there was frightening. My cat would stare at the front door when we were sitting in the living area, she was traumatized from living there.  So was I."

I was sold, at top dollar, a 2010 Certified Subaru Forrester and 6 days later one of my tires went flat due to a nail in the tire. It needed to be fixed which of course wasn't free. I left messages for several sales managers at Subaru to call me back but no one returned my calls. I asked to have the sales manager paged but the receptionist stated that she could not find him. It took me an hour to find a person to speak with. The Subaru sales manager said that they would not know if a tire had a nail in it. I reminded him that the car is certified which is suppose to mean that it was inspected by their mechanics. I told the sales manager that I am not happy with this situation and that the Brunswick Subaru website indicates that their customers must be 100% satisfied. He had a very flat, unconcerned attitude. I told him that this was my second Subaru purchase at Brunswick but he did not seem to care that I am a repeat customer. The sales manager offered to pay for the repair of the tire. I don't feel that this is sufficient compensation for our inconvenience. Needless to say, I will take my business elsewhere from now on. My husband and I have jobs and excellent credit, and do not deserve to be treated so shabily. By the way, our sales person seemed very shadey. Your typical used car salesman. You would be wise to shop elsewhere."

The menu had a lot of options but I went with their deli smoked meat sandwich and fries. If the drink was a free refill, I wouldn't know because the service was lousy to say the least. We waited nearly 20 minutes to place our orders and for lunch, that's inexcusable. As we waited other patrons complained to the waitress about their meals. Solid start.

The smoked meat was about average and with local options being way above this, they didn't impress me much. The fries were excellent however.

All in all, wouldn't come back."
HzXV1gS9dS7AMWlf9tfycQ,_4NHePAXLhcloTD04wqpqw,"Probably the best Adonis in the Montreal area. Biggest with the grandest of selections. 

You go to Adonis to have high quality fruits and veggies, meat cuts as well as selection of good that you will NEVER find at Maxi at the prices that nearly match it that makes a complete mockery of IGA.

This is not your mom and pop store, it's HUGE with several butchers working behind the counter, a pastry place as well as a fast food place where you can pick up some hot grub. I've never done this in this location but have in other locations and most items are a hit or miss variety.

Word of caution, if you dislike huge crowds avoid this place on weekends. You've been warned. It's pretty insane and people are generally purposely being inconvenient to others (leaving the carts in the middle or lanes, being there in groups).

The service is a hit or miss variety, you better hope the butchers or the meat cutters on duty are fresh and willing to work or expect to wait 5-15 minutes to get your cut.

But all in all a great place to shop at."

This location is also a Subway, and looks to be owner operated. I like that! There was a nice selection of breakfast sandwiches and omelettes, and after much debate, I got the twister bagel with cream cheese and a coffee. Loved the cream cheese (like deli cream cheese instead of Philadelphia) and the bagel was massive! Best of all, the coffee was GREAT! Tim who? Ha. I really liked this little spot -and while there wasn't much of a donut selection, I know I will be coming back regularly to my new little coffee shop. Hopefully there will be more donuts next time. :) The women behind the counter were so wonderful and friendly, too. All around, this spot was a great find!"
WYrpxs9U7ODFz70FlQRqww,cMll9W2Xv8DxvCNWdKpRpQ,"Same type of experience as Anesia - I needed a new pair of jeans and happened to come in on a 50% off all women's clothing sale. I picked out a few things off the clearance rack, a few shirts that had a sign on a table that said $9.99 (not clearance and not 50% off of their original price), and the jeans. I got up to the register and asked - since clearance isn't always included in sales like this - if ALL women's clothing was included while holding up my clearance items. She said yes and of course when she rung me up it wasn't. No big deal - I half expected it wouldn't be - just annoying that the sales people even misrepresent the sale.     (I also verified the sign did have small print at the bottom excluding clearance.) 

Then we get to my non-clearance shirts.  Since these weren't clearance and I bought one I liked a few weeks before, I spent some time trying on and picking out quite a few since it appeared to be such a good deal. Of course those conveniently weren't included in the sale either. Another cashier who appeared to be an asst. mgr or something came over and informed us also that these were not included in the sale. I asked if they were clearance. She said no. She wasn't willing to honor the pricing as marked. My fiancГ©e pointed out that this ""sale"" made no sense because a few weeks prior without the 50% off we received the exact same deal and the shirts were marked the same.  

The whole experience just left a really bad taste in our mouths and of course we were so annoyed we vowed not only would we not be returning to the Gap Outlet ever again, but no more outlet shopping before the holidays. This store is the worst!  Whatever consumer group checks false and misleading advertising should make a trip out here."

After dinner we often sit around and drink and they never rush you out. Almost always the date night spot we choose. A real gem in the heart of downtown Whitby.

The doctor I saw didn't even introduce herself to me, I don't know her name and the appointment lasted two minutes (literally!).   I waited over an hour in the waiting room even though it was seemingly empty.   Find another walk-in clinic."
pI2UxM0VnWbrFauLEXXXcg,9FknGjHHH6dzxggVw9QabQ,"Three girlfriends and I made a reservation a week in advance to celebrate a birthday at Sub Rosa.  We arrived at 8:30pm on a Friday and it was pretty quiet, even though the doors open at 7pm.  We loved the atmosphere because the music wasn't blaring.  We could actually hold adult conversation and properly hear each other.  It was noticeable when the music got louder around 10:30, but it was still tolerable.  We left at 11pm and by then the place was busy.  

The crowd ranged in age from 20's to 50's and it was an interesting mix of people.  Most were dressed up as we were.  It has a classy feel and we had stellar service.  The only thing we all needed to adjust to was the co-ed bathroom.  My friend was accosted by a guy seeking a wardrobe opinion who then decided it was okay to lift up his shirt to show off his ""abs.""  I don't know how often this sort of thing happens, but it shouldn't have happened at all.  It would be nice for Sub Rosa to remind the male patrons to be respectful to the ladies when there isn't staff or security monitoring them.  Despite this one incident, I would return for a second visit and my friend who was flashed in the restroom said she would too, but next time it might be with her husband."
Y73eFkZWlv6JZdIcSaiuEQ,9FknGjHHH6dzxggVw9QabQ,"I participated in an annual general meeting at the hotel this weekend that included use of a room for the day and spa services.  

The hotel room was on the main floor across from the pool.  It room was adequate but the restroom is a toilet and bathtub only, so trying to change in there while other people were around was challenging due to extremely limited space.  The vanity area is also very small.  I had wanted to use the hot tub but it wasn't operational, likely due to construction nearby.  The hotel is undergoing renovations.  

I booked a massage at the Le Soleil Spa.  The common area is small but the treatment room I occupied was large and very comfortable.  It had a heated massage table, which I love.  The petite therapist did an excellent job and provided a great therapeutic treatment, which was slightly less aggressive than a hard-core sports massage.  It relieved some pain and yet was still enjoyable.  

I followed the massage with use of the steam room, which is not worth the time, in my opinion.  It's tiled and basically emulates a large shower.  There were no towels for me to grab and sit on.  Steam is piped into the room and there's no controlling it.  It's all steam, all of the time, at one temperature.  It stops occasionally but very briefly and there doesn't seem to be any ventilation.  I had to step out a few times because it was too stuffy and when I did, the steam filled the spa hallway.  In fact, it was so steamy that it got to a point that I couldn't see the water bottle sitting beside me.  I don't think I lasted 10 minutes.  I did appreciate being able to grab a snack and candy on my way out.

If I was staying overnight in Calgary, I'd rather pay more money to stay in a nicer place, but it'll do if you're on a budget.  As an organization, I wouldn't book a function here if you're looking to impress.  However, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a massage at the spa."
DgHRNV-yjV9glCfKbsBVNA,9FknGjHHH6dzxggVw9QabQ,"I was in for a beer tasting a few months ago and have to say, the young cashier working at the time provided some of the best customer service I've seen in ages.  She helped elderly patrons by holding doors and grabbing the product they wanted.  She also joked around with the regulars.  It was really nice to see.  

On the downside, this location is prone to mischief and I know because I heard stories and they have readily accessible security Thurs-Sat every week.  I'm sure every liquor store has seen some action, but a downtown address would not help the situation.  I'm not afraid to shop here, but I might avoid it later in the evening and you certainly wouldn't find me taking advantage of their 2am store hours.  Young and friendly staff give it a good vibe and they keep it stocked to the ceiling with beer."

nCdaVPPQ3UxpKWqM2qYnGg,sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"I am a Souper Salad fan.

If I'm going to go, I try to make it right when they open, that way I'll be one of the first to get my food.  I have a grubby hands complex about buffets and I figure, if I get there first, I won't have to worry about that, right?

First of all, their salad bar is fantastico.  We're talkin' great.  It's filled with everything you could possibly want on your salad and more, including a plethora of dressing choices.  They also have pasta salads, fruit salads, pudding, fruit and other little delights in this area of SS.

Next up are the hot items.  They have a different menu every day of the week, but some food items always stay the same, like their breadsticks and pizza.  But sometimes they'll add different pastas or some kind of taco bar.  They always have a couple soups too.

If you want dessert, they have a frozen ice cream machine with a few different candy toppings for you to put on top.  They also have all the fixin's to make a pretty damn good strawberry shortcake.

You do get a waiter- he or she will take your drink order and pick up any dirty plates, so you'll need to leave a little tip at the end of your meal.  I can't remember the price per person, but it's pretty cheap, but if you're the coupon-y sort, you can often find one in the Sunday paper to get a dollar or two off."
hKFF8inOc_bK0P7bZBv37g,sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ,"Great fast Chinese food.  But the last time I came, for some reason, it wasn't fast at all.  The manager came out to apologize, and brought us free cream cheese wontons or puffs? Not sure, but they were crispy and delicious, so that eased our troubles away.  The manager also gave us a coupon for another free order of those crispy little wonders next time we come.  I hope my food is slow again next time!

5 Stars for customer service alone, but I did have to chop one star off for not really enjoying the spicy veggie dish I got.  Everything else I've tried here is really good and I recommend this place when you want Chinese on the fly.

Keep in mind that it's kinda pricey for being an order-at-the-counter joint, unless you come at lunch."

Their sandwiches are huge, piled high and served with french fries and a pickle and they've been around forever.  I always get the vegetarian sandwich and it's delicious, but my mom always opts for the roast beef and she absolutely loves that. You know a place is good when you can barely find a spot to sit at and that's how Miracle Mile always is.  If you come a little before or after the lunch or dinner rush, you should be fine, otherwise expect a long line to order your food and a mad dash to secure a table. And if you like dessert, get the chocolate or carrot cake- they're both excellent."

Desert Classic Landscaping was extremely quick in responding to our request. They brought us different materials to lay down next to our existing landscape so we could determine what would look best. Less than a week later, our beautiful sandstone patio was finished and beautiful. The entire team was personable and did an amazing job cleaning up the yard after the project was finished. We were also impressed that the owner of the company came out with the project manager to inspect the patio when it was complete. All in all, a great experience. We receive compliments on our patio by everyone that comes to visit.  I highly recommend them and will definitely use their services again in the future."

I put in an app for a house for rent that they took two weeks for them to process my application for. They had one excuse after the next and finally told me the DAY before the move in date, and when I had to move out, that the owner decided to sell the house instead. I asked if they would be refunding my fee considering they jerked me around for nearly two weeks and then decided not to rent. His reply was he could see what he could do because they're are fees he had to pay to process my app. All I did was simply ask how much of it I'd be getting back because after the poor service and LAST minute decision to take it off the market for rent I thought it was, ""bullshit"". Anyone in my position would agree that they would be frustrated with the situation as well. Instead of giving me an estimate or even an answer his reply was, ""oh if you're gonna be like that I'm not gonna do anything"" and then hung up on me and refused to answer my call afterwards. John Bailey is unprofessional, rude and the LAST person you should consider. I've also reported this to fox 5 to investigate if they are using this as a scam to take application fees from those looking to rent."

I get Netgear tech on the line only to hear him mumbling about stinking Cox and why do they keep telling people that.  Then he informs me that based on the serial number on the router, Cox activated it already and the service period is already expired but he will assist with set-up issues this one time.

Not only did the prints turn out breathtaking but he was courteous yet firm with my bridal party and family during pictures. This was very helpful given we had a big bridal party and an even bigger family. I was so overly satisfied with his work that I hired him shortly after the wedding to take family photos. Another thing that I appreciated was that he was willing to work with me on prices and packages regarding exactly what I wanted pictures wise. I highly recommend his services for any photographic needs. Thanks again Yev!

We waited 3hrs and 45 mins to see the doctor who of course ordered tests because they only took urine when we arrived. We ended up being there from 2am to 7:40am. That is ridiculous for any hospital. They only have one doctor on at night. The nurses and doctors kept saying wow you've been here a long time.... Us no shit so do something about it like your job a little quicker. I will never return to this facility if I can help it. If I thought I was dying I would have the ambulance drive further than return here. For a new facility they need a lot more work. I understand it was a holiday but they should have been prepared for New Years. The worst part was the nurse being a jerk when the dr let him know we could go but we needed the iv removed. His response was everyone has been here this long and you feel you issue is more important.. No sir you need the bed because people are waiting and we could had been gone 20 mins prior. Just makes sense to move things along. He argued with us that this was normal for any hospital. Well it shouldn't be a standard especially when lives are at stake in a place like an ER.

Almost no one was patient in answering questions (especially the dentist) but convincing me to get some expensive treatment.

I have my teeth evaluated and cleaned many times before. I am pretty sure I don't need the fancy cleaning they wanted. THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL PART; THEY REFUSED TO PROVIDE REGULAR CLEANING AND KIND OF FORCING YOU TO ACCEPT THEIR RECOMMENDED TREATMENT.

I have never seen any dentist office this unethical. I am very annoyed that I had to waste 2 hours and got nothing done. Only the lady taking x-ray is patient and professional.

I stopped in after eyeing their HUGE donuts in the window. I picked up four donuts - two chocolate glazed, two maple - and they were incredible - not to mention only $1.25 each. I just spent twice that on 'gourmet' donuts at the trendy donut shop Chez Boris several blocks away, and was kicking myself for wasting my time, money and calories at Chez Boris after discovering Nouveau Samos.  I will definitely be back to Nouveau Samos to grab donuts! 

I also grabbed a loaf of sesame bread to have with my dinner. It was not the most amazing bread I've ever had, but the huge loaf was only $2 was still pretty damn good. While the taste of the bread could've been better, it's hard to beat the price, so I might get some bread there in the future, too.

Also had the Spurgos - some sort of European donut w/ three varying dipping sauces. It was quite good, not overly sweet like most other desserts.

I had the roasted veggies with fish on top to go. Seating is very limited. Just a bunch of chairs & small tables with no washroom. So this place is probably best as take away unless you live/work nearby. When I first saw my take away container I thought I might get hungry later. It seemed kinda small. But for 8.25 I got two fish fillets along with the roasted veggies which consisted of cucumber, mushrooms, & onions. For the garnishes I chose lettuce, parsley & tomatoes. I ended up pleasantly full. The food is fresh & tasty. The lady who took my order didn't seem to be fluent in English, but she knew just enough to take my order. Still, she was quite charming with her big smile & ""I bring your food now"" comment as she packed my order up.

rVHzTXMT-_NLqT4-gPEeSw,CSA-YFyZWlxPTeAZRJqMWA,"About 3 years ago I booked a vacation to Halifax through this flight centre location. To make a long story short, they booked us in an awful, old hotel (The Halifax Citadel Hotel) with a cracked tub & sink & rowdy people in the rooms beside us that were making noise until the wee hours in the morning! 

Fast forward to 2009. We booked our honeymoon through this location  again. (I figured with different ppl they might have better service.)  Anyway, they booked us at the Barclay Hotel in Vancouver. Again the hotel was old,  no elevator, room was so small the sink was in the room beside the bed. The window didn't even have a screen, nor did the hotel have a fitness centre. That would've been bearable. But we had also wanted to go to Victoria. We missed it because to get to downtown Victoria from Vancouver would take about 3 hours one way. We didn't have the time to spare. We didn't know there were direct flights going there from Toronto. We only found that out later. How frustrating!

Learn my lesson. Don't book with these guys! You're better off doing your own research & booking yourself!"

When you walk in you feel like you've stepped into the 1990's. The place looks and feels like it hasn't been cleaned since last Apollo mission. Never-mind the facility, the staff aren't better. I felt like I was talking to an angry dolphin through a glass wall at Sea-World. They nod and make noises as if they understand you but when it comes time to make your order and then give it to you it seems to be too daunting of a task. A pack of four year-olds has more chance to prove String Theory than this place does in getting your order right. 

That being said, this place is Taco Bell and it serves Taco Bell. So they get that... I also had a beggar who was loitering in the lobby who tried to take my food from me and force his way into my car as I tried to leave as an added bonus. This is not the fault of the establishment but they should probably take the hint that a homeless man in their lobby trying steal from paying customers is maybe, just maybe, bad for business."

Company actually served really good food and the hostess hooked us up with free entrance for our entire group of 10 to the club LAX.  I have to say that the hookup was really nice considering it was me and 9 guys.  No one ever wants to let guys in for free...especially little Asian guys since they can't really drink that much before turning red and throwing up.

I have fair skin and thin brow hairs, and I was super nervous about the thought of permanent fierce, ferocious brows (ladies, you know what I'm talking about). Julie guided me through each step - from how long it'll take, how many follow up appointments I needed (if any), and the pain tolerance. I am such a scaredy cat when it comes to pain, but this process went by so smoothly. Julie was soft-spoken, easygoing, and honest.

I'm about one month recovered and I'm in love with my brows! They look soft and natural, and I get compliments all the time. Ladies, take the time to do your research, but I highly recommend Julie. Five stars!"

What I like about Subway is the ability to actually see the food in front of one as it is placed on the sandwiches.  This is a customer-driven quality control feature.  One can see the product, see how it is made, see the level of cleanliness/hygiene, see if gloves are put on and/or changed.... So, from fresh materials in front of one to a sandwich that is either cold or heated -- one can see the entire process.  Frankly, the Subs are healthy compared to the oil ladden products of other ""fast food"" places.  My experience with staff has been they've been friendly and helpful in all instances.

I've had just about everything on the menu and usually get the daily special because it's a good deal, $7.50 for a big lunch is a great for anywhere in Toronto. 
Most of the bowls come with rice or noodles, sprouts, veggies, and your choice of meat. Chicken, beef, shrimp, or combo. Then you have 3 sauces to choose from, sweet chili, pan asian, and teriyaki. 
The teriyaki is not very flavorful so I tend to stick with one of the other two. 

The soup bowls are also very good and surprisingly filling. 

There's brown rice on request at no additional charge.

It's work a try for a quick lunch.

There is one tall young guy who is good but if he's not there you don't know what you are going to get. Safe bet is to order something easy like an iced or hot plain tea or coffee. The baristas are all friendly just not very good at making drinks compared to when you go to a regular Starbucks.

I found PFD was near my office so I thought I'd try them.  Chris was great with emailing and was very welcoming. When I walked in it was just like I was walking into my home box.  
The instruction is spot on.  The people are really friendly and genuine.  The coaches know what they're doing and are sincerely interested in you and how you're performing. This is not a Games-Athlete-Only box. This is a great, hometown box where everyone feels welcome.

Anyways, he asked for a fade but to keep the length ( probably 4 inches long) on top.  she clearly didn't understand what a fade was and not only was his hair uneven, but I saw her make a mistake on a '0' on  the razor. so I walked over to point out one side was higher, and she was REALLY rude and said she wasn't finished.

There was 4-6 people standing behind me and they were just as mad. I'm very disappointed in this stores performance.  They also said they could not sell me cigarettes because of the shift change. I've been here once before because it is right around the corner from my home. The last time I used them I used my debit card at the gas pump and had my information stolen. It took me 10 days to get a replacement debit card. And when I went in to talk to the manager about the problem they had no idea of what I was talking about but they did have the pump that it happened on shut down for repair. This place caused 10-15 days of inconvenience.  They are also very ghetto around there I even thought I seen a drug deal going on in the parking lot. And after I spoke with the manager just as soon as I walked out the door there was a vagrant at the front door begging for money. This place needs a armed security guard outside at all times. This place really feels unsafe I would never allow my family to stop in here or use them ever. They need to clean up there act and make there customers feel safe.

hkDEnIx5l3d191zfcMU8bw,nhSxB72PI_uxg9vwKxPpkg,"This was a horrible place. My husband and I wanted to upgrade our bed when we moved into our new home. We found big red mattress on craigs list and went to check them out. We dealt with the manager Jim. He was such a condescending ass. He was worse then a sleazy car salesman. The initial visit went well of course because that's the day we were purchasing. After we had already purchased and went back to schedule delivery it was horrible from that time on. Jim couldn't find our paperwork, we almost didn't receive the four $80 pillows we had purchased an his math was off so our deposit wasn't credited to our account. After they delivered the mattress the first couple nights we loved it. Then on the left side of the bed it started sagging and you felt like you were going to roll off in the middle of the night. When we contacted Jim to let him know our concern he was extremely irritated and acted as if he didn't believe us. He said he has never had a problem with that mattress ever so it was impossible that we had a problem. We told him to please come look at it and we would show him. He came to our house and because the problem with the bed was when you were laying on it and not visible to the naked eye while not in use he didn't want to warranty the bed. (The sagging was only visible to the naked eye when you sat on it) He was so rude an argued with my husband in front of our children in our home about the exchange. He said he was doing us a huge favor by even considering to make things right. He then said he would replace the mattress without using the warranty company for us. Then after my husband was upset with his behavior he said if we weren't planning on purchasing our other beds through him why would he make good on the warranty and he would take photos of the bed to submit to the warranty company so that the claim would be declined and we would just be out the 1500 dollars we spent with them. Then he changed his mind again and said he would replace it for us through the store after my husband pointed out the fact that he was not appreciative of his threats. After he finally left we were both so disgusted with the way he treated us it was just unbelievable. That was the worst part of all the mistakes, his unprofessionalism. Then when we received the new mattress they didn't call us to tell us they were on their way, so I had to move a few things out of the way for the delivery guys and while I was trying to do this I had three screaming babies at all the commotion my dog was making. I couldn't figure out why my dog was going so viscously crazy until I walked to the front door to let them in and saw the delivery guy hanging over my fence whistling and teasing my dog.  Then when they came into the house one of them acted like he was the owner of the company asking all kinds of questions and totally acting as if he had a say in the exchange. I was unaware of who he was so I took the time to explain to him the issues thinking he was maybe a partner or something. He proceeded to tell me that the mattress he was delivering was more firm then the one he was taking and that was alarming because it was supposed to be replaced by the exact same mattress!! Then he said he saw some extremely light light finger marks that were barely visible.  He said he was going to call Jim and tell him the mattress was dirty and acted as if he wasn't going to make the exchange. I told him this is ridiculous you can't barely see them and he had me get a rag and wipe them up which in turn made them visible. His attitude didn't change until I became frustrated and started taking names and asking questions about the owner information an the warranty company info. It was at that point that I was told Jim was not the owner of the company as he had stated to us previously, he was the manager, and the rude delivery guy was just that, a delivery guy named George. I have never in my life been treated so poorly, I couldn't believe it. We spent 1500 dollars with them and had planned on spending 1800 more with them next month to finish our kids rooms and then another 2600 the following month to finish our second home. Obviously that's not going to happen now and we are going to make sure we let anyone and everyone know of the horrible experience we had with him. My husband works with the public on a daily basis an gives an receives recommendations all the time and he will definitely be warning people of our experience. I have several moms groups that I belong to and my church group and we give and receive recommendations also and I will be letting them know of how awful we were treated by them. Now we have a 1500 dollar mattress with NO WARRANTY! When I called to get an address to send a complaint letter to corporate I accidently got a hold of the actual owner of the company Bobbie. He did listen to our complaint and asked what he could do to make it right, but in all honesty this problem was not a matter of material compensation."

I frequent this store and their credit/debit server is out of order at least 2 to 3 times every week. I finally got so irritated, I asked one of the cashiers what the deal was. She stated that it was not just their store but the entire Arizona Circle K server. Now I find that very hard to believe. Do you realize how much revenue Circle K would lose everyday if this were true? It just seems like a company such as this one should be investing a little more time keeping their servers up and running.
They should also take a lesson from QuikTrip about the long lines. QT has cashiers that perform multiple transactions at once and, for some reason this Circle K will have a line backed up nearly out the door. This store is located within the industrial section of Broadway Rd so you'd think the employees would try to keep the lines down especially in the morning. At times its been so bad I've had to ask if they can open another register.

WUCJnk_qJygcIUPTdr__BA,ZdAhxOd1b-dKfSgWuseyFA,"If I could give less than 1 star I would. My wife dropped her ipad a while back because it would not charge. They said they would call before repairs which they did not, they just started. After no call about it being completed, we called and were told it was done. When we got it back, it charged so we thought all was well.

Within a few days, my wife noticed a new issue that had never happened before. The tablet would not recognize the home page and would sporadically shut down pages. She called and they said they would fix it for free since we had just taken it back. My wife was not given a receipt at this time which at the time, we did not think would matter.

After 1 week, we still never heard back. We called and were told they could not find anything wrong. When we took it home, the same problems persisted. We took it back within a week and same story, they said they would fix it for free. There was a receipt for this visit. 

We went out of town and when we returned, no word on the ipad. We called that they said there was nothing they could do. They said they could not refund any costs from the original repair due to it being outside of 30 days. (Their policy is you can only bring it back within 30 days. Receipt #1 and #3 are about 35 days apart. They claim since there are no records of us coming in for time #2, they can't help us. Keep in mind in order for them to take the ipad for the 3rd time, since it was greater than 30 days, they must have known at the time we had just been there). 

Now each time we brought it back, it was within 30 days of the previous time. However, coincidentally enough, they LOST all the records of my wife returning the ipad the 2nd 2 times. They did not have her phone number or email. They said they had no receipts.  Also, the guy who did the original ""repairs"" had been fired.

Summary, we took it in to get fixed and paid for it. We got it back with worse problems. They fired the guy who did the repairs. They ""lost"" all records except for the original repair. They never communicated with us during the process. They refuse to compensate for essentially breaking our ipad.

So here is the story....Went into to buy a hand held phone for my elderly Mom, who  kinda watered her old phone while gardening-ya know that happens...Went in Radio Shack on Charleston to just re-place it with a new one, but they only had the two hand helds this time, so ok.- i buy it .Take it home, let it charge, does not work properly-take it back. 

When I enter the store as the ONLY other person other than the clerk I stand at the counter for 3 mins...the has his back to me the entire time ,  never turns around, never says hello, can i help you, nada. Finally he comes around and asks ""what's up"".

I tell him about the new phone not working, he says would you like another one, I say yes, yes please....so far so good...right...but wait here it comes.  I say- ""Just so you know it appeared when i got it home that the box was opened  before"", he says ""Yes, they all are""- puzzled I say, ""they all are?"" ...""do you open them when checking them in"" (thinking of inventory or some shit) - ok so here it comes, sitdown yelpers....................""no, once an item is returned it goes back on the shelf again"" ............................... so in my shock, just as I am sure you are now.....on so many levels       I say, ""Are you kidding me right now, let me get this straight...if this second phone phone in my hands for some reason does not work, I can return and get the first jacked up one i bought/returned, or better yet, 100% fact, the next person that buys the phone i just returned is coming back TOO!""  ""Yes, Maam- I just do what they tell me to do and if you have an issue you need to contact our corporate headquarters."" ""Really?"". ""Yeah really Lady"".

There is more to the story which is all so boring but that is it in a nut shell.

This is so wrong on so many levels and beyond shocking....JUST DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM RADIO SHACK- CUSTOMER SERVICE, CUSTOMER EXPIERENCE and PRODUCT QUALITY IS NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM AT ALL......and that Dude at the counter did us all a favor by telling me so I could tell you."

W6sPM9SCCbSVf1HA1oOPWQ,esdRtA08ZHjxuGqKy5xoAw,"I should have read the reviews before going to this place.  Now I'm added to the victim list.  They deserve 0 star!  Looks like it's a problematic business for years!  If you want to take care of your garments, DO NOT come to this place! 

I experienced the same things the previous yelpers did.  They ruined my all white Burberry dry coat the following ways:

1. An abrasion on the left sleeve area. The fabric has a obvious scratched line on it. 

2. The inner lining with the Burberry brand label and signature pattern on it. The colour is bleached out of the pattern, the whole big area is damaged to a point that is non-reparable! Now the lining looks like it's an old pairs of jeans that was washed over 100 times! 

3. Got a new black stain on the right sleeve area. It was not there when I brought it in, it appeared after the first wash in May. I saw this and agreed for a second wash as remedy. Then the stain spread after the second wash. When I was asked to give a third chance to remove the stain, I agreed with the condition that if there is any risk of damaging the coat, it should not be washed and I shall be notified immediately. I was not notified. The coat was not ready for pick up twice after a given 'ready' date. Today I found that during the delay, Pauline, the staff made the call to inquire and was told that it was being SOAKED. The label on the coat clearly stated 'specialist dry cleaning only', soaking should not be taken place! Again, if specialist dry cleaning were not possible at your plant I should be notified. The coat should be returned untouched from the second wash. 

Like all others, I was told to contact Riz. I emailed him, I called and left messages, he just ignored me.  I reported this to the Better Business Bureau recently and the next step will be bringing it to the small claim court.

According to what they have promoted on their official business website, after contacting them about the damage, they will 'conduct a thorough and timely investigation', sadly it was not my case. I have been calling, leaving messages in store and in voicemail, and emailing for a week, without a single respond, it cannot be called 'timely'! They also promoted their level of customer care as 'Attention to detail and care is paramount in ensuring the clients' expectations are met and exceeded. At The Preeners Custom Fabricare a satisfied client is the foremost objective, all strategies and efforts are geared to ensure that this happens.' Again, I experienced the opposite, I have been trying to contact a manager (I was told Rees is the only manager) who takes care of complains for more than a week, I still receive no response by any means.

This company have issues with cleaning service, customer service, warranty promises, and false advertisement on their website! 

When I see all other victims having the same issue, I would like all of you who are interested in pursuing justice to contact me.  We have to be gathered together to have a voice.  We have to do something to stop this Preeners scam going on in our city and get back the compensation we deserve!"

Tell me I'm missing some essential document and send me home, frown and scoff at me, refuse to look me in the eye even when I'm going all smiley-friendly-I-love-you on 'em?

Such was the nervous feeling on the day E and I went looking for a marriage license. We put on ""nice"" clothes, thinking that would hedge the bet. We made a pizza pit stop on the walk to the office, just in case they tried to kill our dinner hour. Took cash in case the machine was down. Practiced our smileyfaces.

So you can imagine how shocked, then joyous, I was to get here and be a) congratulated b) smiled at MULTIPLE TIMES and c) treated like my time was worth something. They even asked where we were thinking of honeymooning, like we were pals. Attempted to answer questions they didn't have to. Patiently explained the slightly confusing data entry bit. Told us good luck, and to have a nice day.

Finally found a place that cuts my funky hair the right way!  Newly opened for about 6 weeks, Ranky is the sole hair professional there until the business starts to gain traction.  His assistant will shampoo your hair to prepare you for your session.

He has cut both my hair and my better half's hair for a total of 3 visits thus far.  He takes his time, double and triple checks his work to ensure symmetry and length.  On top of that, they have a $5 off normal price sale for their grand opening.  No complaints about that!

These shoes are hand made to perfection and I love these whacky designs especially the heels. If I had the money, I would love to own a pair of these beauties!!"
YKEfXcJFJQ8uIDsBywAO3g,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,"Note: The big neon sign says CINEMA WORLD SOUTHLAND 9, but this is another Carmike theater. Don't be alarmed when you see the sign; you're at the right place. I suppose it's too much coin and effort to change it. 

As another reviewer stated (hi Kate), it's hidden by Clairton Boulevard's various shopping centers in the land of Century III, but that's partly why I think it's a quaint little theater; it's under the radar and therefore you aren't made to feel like a sardine when you're seated. Nor are you likely to be turned away. 

I came here often for many years during my childhood. Until tonight, the last film I had seen here was Roland Emmerich's excellent eco-thriller ""The Day After Tomorrow"" back in 2004. Tonight it was the latest Harry Potter *burp* tim hunter *burp* extravaganza.

 I spoil the girlfriend. I do. She's a fangirl, but knowing how people go Beatlemania o'er the franchise, I thought of this theater and knew we wouldn't be out of luck here.  

As we walked in, I was nicely reminded of something about this Carmike that I had completely forgotten about; that exquisite hand drawn/painted mural of movie stars you'll see as you make your way into the lobby. This was one instance where I really wished I had brought a camera with me. It's really a sight to see and is something that makes this cineplex a touch more special. 

My parents used to point to each celebrity and quiz me on who they were way back when.

""Who's that?""

""Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock.""

""Nooo. Those are the characters they play.""

""Oh. William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.""

I still can't name all of them since some of the drawings are a tad vague, but you will see hometown guy Michael Keaton, Marlon Brando, The Three Stooges, Sly Stallone, Jack Nicholson, and Dudley Moore among many others. Take a gander if you have a few minutes. 

The lobby doesn't have any video games from what I saw, but there are  some vending machines that sell junky little toys (you know you pined for 'em as a munchkin) and not a whole lot else aside from the snack bar.

I forget how many screens there are, but they don't have stadium-style seating. In that regard, it's somewhat outmoded, but the sound and picture are fine, and all in all, there are no legitimate gripes about this moviehouse. If ya want IMAX, go to an IMAX theater, y'know? 

So if your local theater's completely sold out of tix for whatever blockbuster (hypemachine?) you ""need"" to see, try the Southland, or just come here regardless. It's an easy bet, but remember, look BEHIND the shopping center. It ain't on the main drag. 

P.S. The uberpolite, friendly, old-fashioned service is a selling point too. It's as if your parents (the staff is mostly middle-aged and older) are chaperoning a film screening and want to make sure everyone has a good time and behaves themselves."
JpU4vB4twBCe73VN-S7ARA,rCWrxuRC8_pfagpchtHp6A,"They have what ya need. It's a well-kept store. 

Convenience notwithstanding, did the old South Hills Theater really need to be demolished to make way for this CVS when another just like it already stands 5 minutes away on Brookline Boulevard?

hN8aKr_aLUBqcfW5BV6F2Q,pW08HeUH6SJGBewy15PD2A,"I was excited about going to the Polo Championships as it was my first event of the sort. I read the reviews on Yelp and it was not looking good but I thought I'd give it a try anyways and experience something different. Upon walking in I learned they had an awesome car display. It was either old classics or Lambos & such. I'm all about the old classics! The cars were about 4 rows deep and there was a ribbon around the area. I asked someone if we were allowed to cross it in order to view the cars and he said he didn't know so we took a chance and went for it. It was awesome seeing these old classics, the engines were so clean you could eat off of them and the interior, wow! Awesome indeed. After about 10 min or so of checking out the cars security said we were not allowed in that area (behind the tape). Apparently some owners of the vehicles had some stuff stolen so they didn't want anyone near them. Well, that sucks that anyone would have to steal anything and what sucks even more is that if you're displaying your car then only the ones on the very front and sides will actually be seen and appreciated since you can't really view anything in the middle area. A wasted opportunity to show off beautiful cars I think. Moving along, we decided to check out some drink/food vendors of which there are many. I wasn't too hungry so we just got a couple of overpriced drinks. Upon walking around the field I noticed 2 types of areas in which to view the match. The first was the tented areas at $300+ per ticket and it sounded like those people were having a blast as loud music was playing, everyone was drinking or smoking a cigar and socializing. (I did not see anyone actually interested in watching the match though). On the other side of the field there were smaller tents, I believe it was the family/friends of those involved playing the sport. There was a tiny area with 1 set of bleachers (it was empty, probably because the view was terrible). Aside from this, a couple of empty grassy areas from families who didn't show up. So essentially there was no place to sit or properly view the game unless you were in the tented area. Mind you, it seemed as if most people were there to drink, socialize, network, and basically have an excuse to drink and party or simply dress up and be out and about. That's all fine, just not what I'm about. I actually wanted to see the game and appreciate the horses which were stunning of course. We left after just a couple hours and a few people on the way out we came across said the same thing, that they expected a better view and it seems very few were actually here for the match. Personally, not my thing but at least I had the experience."

I've been a huge fan of JF since the high school days when everyone was wearing Doc Martens but I went with JFs.  My fave pair were saddle shoes in the Gibson style with Angel Soles - sooo cool but I eventually wore them into the ground!

Had a look around the store and spied some nifty men's shoes for the DH, which he picked up at a great sale price.  Sales staff were super friendly and chatty. 

Cool boutique addition to the Distillery area for sure."

It's your standard hotel with amenities like a gym and pool.  If you're here without a car you will feel stranded because the location is nothing great.  It's in an industrial area so there isn't much in walking distance.

I got a conference rate so I wouldn't know how reasonable this hotel would be considered.  The whole experience here was just okay.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable but man was it ever dated.  The rooms look like they hadn't been renovated in years.

The staff go above and beyond and really know their stuff. (I actually think they have personally played with everything in the store.) They always have stuff that is age appropriate no matter how old.  All I have to do is ask and they guide me around the store effortlessly. Just last month I was looking for something that they didn't have in stock (my fault for being behind the trend) and they ordered it in for me, called me when it came in and, had it wrapped waiting for me at the counter when I arrived.

Communication was incredibly impossible with the older gentleman (I use the term loosely) and he did what I call ""sucked his teeth"" and made an ""Aaah!"" Noise- as if he were very irritated with me when I asked him if he would put a tip on the nail he forgot to put one on.

1st. I went in for an overlay 
(no tips should have been put on to begin with!)
 I had spent 2 weeks growing them out..

2nd. He cut one of my real nails very short
 (the one he ""forgot"" to put a tip on) 

3rd. When I asked for a tip on that one as well that is when he said the nail was the same length as all the others (I'm assuming, because he spoke the worst English I've ever heard used in the service industry), it very well would have been even had he not cut it to begin with, still not sure why he did (because he didn't understand maybe..?), a blind man could see the nails were not even (none of them!) 

4th. He then made the irritated, passive aggressive, attitude noises VERY LOUDLY and sucked his teeth at me right in front of the other customers! 
I was HORRIFIED! !!
 I said never mind & left immediately (while the ladies screamed at me that I had to pay)

Yeah, right! 
Pay you for something I didn't ask for! ..? Plus all he had done was put 9 tips on & cut them 9 different lengths! 
I came in for an OVERLAY! 
(This is where you put Acrylic over the Real Nail! ..since you don't seem to know) 
Not to mention you (the older man) COMPLETELY EMBARRASSED me in front of everyone in the salon! 
I was shaking, I was so upset that I couldn't drive! 

5th. The next Nail Salon had to cut All the nails so they were even & yes, I asked about the two nails that ""Stevie Wonder"" thought were perfectly even & 3 people busted out laughing about how uneven they were, and of course, said they weren't even close (including a patron).

If you enjoy getting insulted and treated like a bother this is your salon!

FHvOvhUnuFfDv0j5gpqzRg,hrA2TKOiPrJ0Va3ceAgq9g,"For starters I like most people am not a fan of going to the dentist.  But sometimes you have to take care of business.   I was referred to Endodontic Specialists by Dr. Robert Feeley of Downtown Dental Centre for a root canal.  I simply can't recommend Dr. Glen Partnoy highly enough.  He was very professional, straight and to the point.  He explained the diagnosis thoroughly in terms I could understand and prepared me for the procedure.  All in all it took less than an hour.  Dr. Partnoy prescribed me pain meds but honestly I have felt no post-op discomfort of any kind.  At then end of the day my insurer Manulife only designated eligible $934 out of $1355 for the root canal fee. They only pay the prevailing rate for a dentist to perform root canals as opposed to a specialist.  For me I will be going to Endodontic Specialists everytime--it's worth it!"
2vP1XZKqSbD8vmudVVMcrw,_2S10MPGKFynMze9_mcRGA,"From the pre-op information gathering over the phone to the last minute prior to discharge, my experience with the staff at the Arizona Spine and Joint Hospital (ASJH) has been first rate. The nursing staff, RNs and CNAs, are top notch. It was very clear that for them it's not just applying the standards of care. During my post-op stay I was treated with compassion and respect, more like a close personal friend than a patient. Never intrusive, the nursing staff were proactive in assisting with pain management, patient education and personal care needs. And that Physical Therapist, aka Mr. Meanie, don't be fooled, he is the best. The food service staff aren't slackers either. The menus were diverse. Don't be afraid to ask for alternate food choices. One night grilled steak was on the menu. Turns out it was a filet perfectly grilled to my order. WOW!  I would not hesitate to recommend this hospital for any surgical joint or spine repair."
z37K7WEXTybpbdX58LnYQg,A_ZqOC2aVnj1nA9G6O8iyg,"This apartment is a absolute train wreck. I decided to start living here because it was reasonably priced considering that it was close to uptown. I moved in roughly in august and it was a rocky start, I went through hell trying to obtain packages, because their mailroom has very little to no organization, I also struggled to find parking at any time even though it was ""guaranteed"". I then got a emotional support animal and presented that to the office, about a month later, someone saw me with the animal and the office threatened me with a 1000 dollar fee to have the animal. I showed them again the paper work and told them that I had already done this, but it took much convincing. Throughout the rest of my experience at Post Gateway i found that the doors to the outside walkways were left open or unlocked most of the time, which was frightening considering the amount of homeless people who stayed at the steps next to them. The apartment constantly was renovating, but never in a way that seemed to be productive, such as they never cleaned the common hallways or emptied the trash that was left in the trash room. This place by the time I moved out started to look alot less like an apartment and more like a shit hole. 

Now to top it all off they expect me to pay 700 dollars for the cleaning and repairs on my apartment. To explain, they offered this service to clean the apartment for 150 dollars flat fee, I unfortunately had already cleaned up all of it when I finally saw this. If I knew this was an option I more then likely would have done it, but I already invested my time in cleaning myself. Well on the itemized bill I received it was 150 for cleaning, which seems a bit riddiculous considering the amount of cleaning I put in and purchasing a carpet cleaner. When asked for photos they could only provide photos of normal wear and tear. Then on top of this they want me to pay roughly 550 for a new carpet. They claim that because there is one burn mark they must replace the whole carpet, yet the amount of carpet that was in the apartment should cost no less then 200 max. That being said an actual reasonable repair for the carpet would have been to put a patch of carpet that they would replace where it was messed up. 

I am trying to fight for them to bring the cost down but currently no luck. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS APARTMENT DO NOT LIVE HERE."

Hotel looks very new, bright, and clean. We checked in and the room had a vanity/keurig area, open closet, desk, drawer, and huge flatscreen on the wall. Shower was beautiful with a lit mirror. You do get mini bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and lotion. All fragrance free, which is awesome!
We walked down the lobby to the casino. There was live music and regulars dancing. It is a country theme and the regulars are seen with cowboy hats. The crowd is more for seniors. Small with slot machines and some card games. Also there is a small and inexpensive restaurant with food at a low price!

He was leaving that day for vacation, however promised to continue discussing the landscaping as soon as he returned. I never heard from him. I reached out to him on 2/23/18. The River Birch that they had trimmed was weeping, and we noticed a gash into the part of the tree that was left. We asked if that was normal, and if something should be put over those areas weeping. He text back and asked a few questions, but offered no solution. I asked him about the landscaping, he said he forgot, and apologized. Then silent. I text again on 3/5 about the tree and told him there was orange fungus now growing. His only reply was that it was a 50/50 chance and he would recommend cutting down the tree. Not appropriate or acceptable. Now we have a tree that we don't know is living or dying or if the other main branch us going to fall. I cannot recommend this company."

For this reason, we ultimately went with a direct carrier that was a better match for our special needs. Still, I felt is was important to take the time to write a review to let others know how impressed we were with Nicole at Chauncy Insurance. From the beginning she was immediately available to help us (no voicemail or waiting for a call back). She took the time to explain various policies, laws and procedures. She was prompt in finding us the top carriers with the best quotes in addition to explaining the benefit of other options if wanted/needed. As a meticulous shopper, I can be demanding and high maintenance and loaded with tons of questions. Nicole was amazingly patient throughout the process, took her time to explain things and knowing we were on a time crunch, she even made herself available after hours via email or her personal cell phone if I had any addition questions or concerns. Thank you Nicole and I'm hoping we can work together in the future!"

kIRtBvrlp5TCoAEe1az8cw,PGeiszoVusiv0wTHVdWklA,"Geox is an Italian brand that has come over the Atlantic for a few years now.  I was introduced to them by a friend who swears her entire extended Italian family only wears this brand... everyone from the babies to the grandfathers.  

I have to admit that their quality is a step up from the usual Nine West or Bay offerings.  They're actually well made and have some good thoughts on the science behind them.  They have 2 big claims which I like for Canada... one of them being waterproof leather (hellloooo winter slush) and the other being breathable (oh yes summer humidity, I didnt forget about you).  Another nice thing, you're actually buying real leather... none of this fake leather you'd find everywhere else.  

For me, I've had 3 of boots from here and personally, they have worn beautifully year over year.  That's right... I've had them for a few years each and the leather still looks great even with winter wear.  I do maintain them but I've never had the soles wear through, have leather peel or crack, or any stitching become undone.  I find these are definitely suitable for Canadian winters.  That being said... these boots are also my most pragmatic.  They're not cute or sexy... they're solid and reasonable shoes.  You know the ones that a parent might wear.  So the heels are not stilettos ever, colours are not crazy, not tassels or sequins... like I said, reasonable.  I would love to buy shoes here cause they're comfy but I would feel like my mom in the styles.

As for the price point, ok... this is wear you might pause and go ""$350 for boots?"" But here's the thing... if I got to Aldo or Nine West, I'm buying $180 boots for fake leather that will only last maybe 2 years.  I buy the Geox ones on sale for 20% off at $280 and they last 4+ years and still look good.  So Im saving money in the long run, I stay dry, and I'm not freezing either.

As for service, it can be touch and go here... it really depends on what day you head in.  I've been ignored completely and then other times, I'm rolled out the red carpet.  It really depends on who is working here.  That being said, I've never had an issue of asking for a size and them being helpful.  You never know here.  

So if youre looking to have the latest family forward European styles... Geox got you covered on all fronts.  It's great comfy shoes and yes at a price point higher than you're used to but they will work in Canada whether it be the dead of winter or oven temps of summer."

DaXZ_HiJNjWWZ9hbBy73CA,GyM1GVQDRUudov36NCY0Eg,"I am by no means a good golfer, but this course was by far the worst i've ever played. I didn't expect too much from the price and from the fact it was a short 9 hole course but it failed what few expectations I had. 

There is not a single tree on the course or within miles of the course it seemed. However there are around 5 man made ponds throughout the course that offer zero scenic beauty and most just get in the way. Maybe they could use the water from the lakes to water the dying grass throughout the course. 

Being in the middle of corn fields, I couldn't have expected much from the scenery so that really was on the tip of the iceberg when it came to the lack of quality this course offered. None of the holes were numbered, none had distances marked, they were almost all under 200 yards, and the cart paths were non existent. Some holes overlapped leaving you in harms way if another group was playing in front or behind you. One hole tees off right at the end of the driving range so its a good thing nobody who is halfway decent hits there. 

It was very affordable however, so it may be the best option for a family or group of friends who know nothing about golf and just want to go mess around. Its safe to say I will never be back until some sort of golf professionalism is brought to that course. I'd be ashamed to be the club pro at Legends."

Most Mikes restaurants have undergone a makeover in recent months, they have a new logo and simplified menu that still focuses on pizza and pasta dishes. The Place Versailles location is no exception to this rule, the decor is very modern and suitable for a casual sit down with family or slightly more upscale business lunch. I love the red, white and grey color combos, everything looks clean and bright. There is even a bar and smaller, closed off room that is perfect for group events.

I opted for the do it yourself ""Duetto"" option which mixes a pasta and pizza of your choice, for around 12$ it was very reasonably priced. I recommend the bruschetta rolls which are smaller pizza bites if you do not want a traditional pizza. These are fun and easy to eat as you can dip them in marinara sauce or drizzle the seasoning oils over them.

My partner had a submarine which was generously sized, and upgraded for a meat sauce poutine that was a real knock out. The sauce is so flavorful and the mix of curd and parmesan cheese added to that extra savoriness. 

I noticed that the pasta dinner options are closer to the 20$ range and feature many of the same Mikes sauces that are widely available in grocery stores, therefore I'm not sure it would be worth it. They used to offer a great tortellini dish but this has now been removed from the menu.

I would stick with pizzas, sandwiches or the duo options for lunch. Great quality and value.

This used to be a Loblaw's, but the Provigo chain has undergone a multi million dollar project to expand, rebrand and renovate some of their existing stores. The Saint Sauveur location is a star child of this facelift.
You're entering a 64,600 sq. ft. showpiece that is bright, well lit and spacious. Upon entering you'll first notice a massive patisserie counter with cupcakes, macarons and other gourmandises. Fresh produce will be a few steps behind. The new concept has a selection of ""boutiques"" along the perimeter, like a deli counter, charcuterie, oyster/shrimp bar and cheese counter with the prettiest 2 feet tall glass fridge containing an impressive array of local and imported cheeses.
There is also a Joe Fresh collection of apparel for adults and children.

The Loblaws/Provigo brand excels in going above and beyond to turn grocery shopping into an experience. The food is premium and gourmet, sampling stations are delish. Everything was taken into consideration, there's nothing boring or traditional about this store, even the floor is a popping orange. To make your shopping trip more enjoyable, the couple times I went over the holidays, they had a live jazz band playing! If you were dragged along and didn't feel like shopping, take a seat at the cantine and make use of their free wifi!

Yes the prices are higher than what you would find at other grocery chains, this location caters to tourists and skiers - however if you're purchasing specialty goods, it is worth it, you'll find things that are uncommon elsewhere."

It was the second to last thing we did on our lastest trip to Vegas, and it was a fun little place.  The owner was super nice and talked our ears off the whole time.  Unfortunately we were travelling about 3 hours after our stop, so we couldn't really get any of the frozen or other foods, but they do carry Mars Delight, which is only the greatest candy bar on the earth."
rNx9kDos4LJHGUOS-eprxw,tbH_UcGXsAIBQU2QtKL6Pw,I brought my dog here for a shedding blow out. They told me that this would stop her shedding. They said it would take two days of her shedding allot and then she would be done. That did happen but a month later she was shedding again! They also told me that the price would never change on me. When I booked her to go in again the price went up $20!!!! and they couldn't care less about the price promise they offered me. I am pricing out other places to get this done. I wouldn't go there if I was you.

However, when we went yesterday mid morning they did not have bananas and we were told they were not serving acai bowls because they didn't have all the ingredients. The pastries were also extremely limited. The cashier/barista working seemed very distracted - my friend had to point out where on the menu the Nutella syrup was and also had to tell her how to enter an AmEx card number (their card reader was down). Then when our food was prepared and sitting in the window, we had to get up both times and ask her to give it to us. We were also there as another customer was complaining about being overcharged and saw another potential customer walk out during that situation. The main restaurant is beautiful, though, and the food was amazing, so I will definitely be back to give it another try."

Great sliders from this place. I would recommend getting a double as it make a better meat to bread ratio than the single but above all make sure you get some tots. They are to die for.  I did have a little issue getting exactly what I ordered but as they are very busy and that fact all was very good I will let it slide this time.  Hope to see your truck around again soon.

I tried to contact them regarding a property they listed on Craigslist, and I kept being told the realtor wasn't available. The 3rd time I called, the woman didn't ask any thing, just said 'One moment' and put me on hold for 10 minutes. When I called back after hanging up (at this point thinking maybe something was just wrong with the phone) the woman answered, and before I could say anything, put me right back on hold. After 5 minutes I gave up and hung up. I tried emailing (a second time) the next morning, and he finally called and told me that he was 'too busy' to answer inquiries in the same day, and proceeded to inform me that the place I was looking at was rented. He then asked for a price range, I told him $450. He then told me 'well I have one for $500, so you could deal with that'. That's when I informed him that he shouldn't treat people this way, and hung up on him."

Both Cookie and Bree are always pleasant and fun to be around.  I highly recommend Studio 10 Nails to anyone looking for a nail salon in Scottsdale."

They came back to check the water and adjust the chemicals. All in all they completed it in about a week. They are busy with other clients I am sure! We have an average size pool, and the total cost was about $4,000, which was  below every other place we called for an estimate!  Some estimates were  close to $6,000!  It is beautiful!

nIEhsGbw0vJuYl05bzzj6Q,elbW-V-hWfyHyApoyOKv_Q,"I was led to Bloom and Blueprint by my fantastic photographer, who seemed to get the vibe and type of wedding we were looking for and knew this might be a good fit. I met with Kate and Erika and instantly fell in love. I had spoken to other planners in the Valley and they all made me feel as though I was below their pay grade and that they only wanted to work on weddings that were on the more luxe end. I never got that impression from these ladies and they always made it apparent they were more than willing to accommodate any budget.

We ended up hiring them for partial planning, design and florals. I had an inkling of what I wanted for our big day, but had a hard time vocalizing exactly what it was we were hoping for or making it come to life. You see the boards on Pinterest and think ""I want that!"" but it's difficult to execute. Kate was able to take my confusing words and ideas and pinned ideas and turn them into reality. She came up with several ideas that helped really bring the concept together and make it a cohesive and beautiful day. And her florals are UNBELIEVABLE! I received so many compliments on her work! She and Erika were both very responsive throughout the process and recommended vendors where I needed them and were great about giving feedback on what I needed to be doing and when. 

The wonderful Erika helped orchestrate the timing of the day and make sure everything and everyone knew when it was supposed to be happening. Her organizational skills are top notch! Our wedding ended up being on one of the coldest and rainiest days Arizona has seen in quite a bit. We had an outdoor ceremony and cocktail hour planned and Erika was able to rearrange the format and still make our day perfect, rain or shine. She and the other Bloom and Blueprint ladies worked their tails off throughout the reception to make sure it all went off without a hitch! 

I definitely recommend reaching out to these ladies to make your wedding dreams come true!"

Two of our group waited for us in the cafe because it was 117 outside, when we finished our tour we were going to join the other two and she ""manager I'm assuming"" greeted us with a ""What do want?! We close at 3!"" Really it was 2:25 pm and we were just going to get ice teas. The museum and the gift shop I will give 5 stars. The cafe due to the rude lady I will not give 1 star.

If I had to guess' I'd say there were about ten vendors total at the 'On the Ranch Farmer's and Artisan Market'. Out of those, only one vendor was actually selling produce, which was priced rather expensively I might add. Other vendors were selling scarves, hot sauce, honey, and jewelry. This Farmer's market is located at the Craig Ranch Regional Park towards the rear end of the park, kind of next to the dog park. The vendors are situated in the actual parking lot. Look, I live in North Las Vegas and was upset I made the trek out here. I was excited that a Farmer's Market would be available in North Town, but I'll just stick to the Fresh 52 Farmer's Market in Tivoli Village. Thanks, but no thanks.

The biggest disappointment was the tostones (fried green plantain) they were dry and tasteless and if I had to guess they were reheated from the day before, blah! I have no Latin American background, but even I can cook better at home. The beans and rice were good as were the variety of homemade sauces (chimichurri and salsa tomatillo) they bring to the table.

I gave her 3 chances, and the third time it was enough... I couldn't handle the pain (that she caused) in my lower back and she told me that ""pain doesn't matter""and that it was normal, and that we had to continue working through the pain. She also was very erratic and unprofessional with her communication, interrupts mid-sentences and is a poor listener. A real red flag was when she told me that i would not be able to ""deliver my baby naturally"" unless i continued to get worked on by her. I now went to a different pre-natal chiropractor and what a difference...much more soft and explained things way better! They used totally different techniques. My new chiropractor was surprised to learn what Dr. dawn did to me and how rough she was with me while being pregnant, i am glad i listened to my gut and stop going! I heard

I took the family to the Canalway Center last weekend and we played on the playground, hiked, took pictures, and hiked some more.  

There is so much to see here from the Canalway Center's indoor attractions, to the Erie Canal down the hill, to the little swamp walkway, to the mountain biking trail, to the playground, to the old train track memorabilia, and finally, to the towpath along the canal.  I come here often to ride the towpath and mountain bike trail, which is viewable on Google Maps.  Now, as far as mountain bike trails are concerned, this is not a destination, but since it is right next to the towpath, it makes for a nice challenge.

There is a kids fishing tournament here once per year in the Canal.  It's great!

Fast forward to yesterday and I bought the Outback from the same salesman, as promised. I paid $4,000 less than sticker and about $2,000 less than invoice. I got a fair price for my trade and now I'm driving a brand new 2018 Outback, which I really like, especially the all wheel drive. It has a lot of bells and whistles that I'm getting used to.

We started by sharing a chicken poutine, and I have to say, it was one of the best poutines I have ever had! I would definitely go back just for poutine.  We also tried out a few of their $9 martinis. I would definitely recommend the ""pink panties"" martini. SO delicious!!

For dinner, we both had the steak, which is priced at under $20. I think part of our decision in choosing the steak was that it came with a side of white mac and cheese. 

Our waitress was very friendly and happy to answer any questions we had. She checked on us enough that we didn't feel ignored in the empty restaurant, but she also gave us our space to enjoy dinner privately. 

We are a young couple, but my parents had actually referred this restaurant to us because they enjoyed their experience so much. They went on a Saturday night, and said it was so busy that you wouldn't get in without reservations. 

I give Social Resto Louge a 5 star rating!! And I will definitely be visiting this restaurant again!"

r-xSAqU_XWJv_prOKCYFKQ,48-X_KMrgxr2aSPInVgPbQ,"Being new in the area, first thing was first - finding good food. My first journey leads me a block away to Mean Bao. After having Banh Mi Boys several times, I thought it'd be nice to have something to compare it to.

Judging by the lack of reviews, I assume this establishment is relatively new. The decor is very simplistic, boasting brick walls coated in white. Customers are open to sit anywhere they please and chopsticks are readily available in a cup on the table.

First up for comparison is the Pork Belly steamed bao. The steamed bao here are a tad bit on the smaller side. Flavour is pretty good, but I think the amount of hoisin sauce overpowers the bao a bit. I think the bao itself is screaming for more veg (something more than just cukes).

The pork and shrimp dumplings though are well done! Definitely my favourite of the two. Juicy and meaty - they don't skimp on the meat. I want aware of the spice levels for this, but their spiciest is just sriracha, apparently.

The prices are alright, but I don't expect to come here every single time. I could convince myself to go more if it was a tad cheaper, or the portion size got bigger though.

Still good though! I recommend to anyone in the area :)."

n4J24P38xDD94slTrcp7qA,9hmAKVRfY7Vw_tOJ_3P8pg,"For those who have never been to a Jimmy Johns, the concept is simple - simple sandwiches with a lot of flavor. This is not like a subway where you choose what goes exactly in your sandwich, each sandwich comes with certain things on it, and you are free to add and subtract what you want. The most unique thing about Jimmy Johns, however, is the fact that you can get it delivered. 

This particular Jimmy Johns is one of the best I have been to and one of the best about delivery. Typically, my sandwich gets to me in around 15 minutes, sometimes 20 if it is busy. And 9/10, they have the right order. Mistakes happen, however, everytime they do, they strive to make it right which is what counts. 

The food is always fresh. They make their bread fresh in stores everyday, along with cut their veggies, slice their meats -- this is all done in stores. I know if I'm getting a Jimmy Johns Sandwich, it is going to be good. Their menu is pretty simple, you have a choice of ham, turkey, bacon, roast beef, Italian meats, and then of course veggie. There are three different ""levels"" that you can get - the first one is JUST meat (sometimes cheese), the second is usually one type of meat and cheese plus veggies and sauces, and the third is usually meat and bacon, or two types of meats plus veggie and sauces. The nice thing about ordering online or in stores is that you can add and subtract whatever you want on your sandwich. 

NEW UPDATE!! They just updated their menu (April 2018) to include ranch dressing and now pickles on their sandwich. I tried their ranch and it was WONDERFUL. It is a ""spicy"" ranch (it was not spicy, just very flavorful) and would taste very good with a turkey club. It is a $0.50 up charge but it is so worth it. 

I really have no complaints. All the employees are very nice, and they do deliver to JCU. Oh - and they do take those ""funny"" requests (my brother ordered me lunch during midterm week and told them to write Cats are Awesome on the bag  to make me smile, and they did it. And yes, it made me smile). 

5/5 stars. If you need a quick lunch that is not fried food, this is the place to go!"

-ApqBP-q8OXWKJ-B6zPaPg,9bcFzhy96znoZGpZnjChJw,"Right away, I'd have to say it's an odd little place, one of those combination businesses that doesn't seem to have any sort of connection, like the Futon and Birkenstock place on 14th St NW or the Greek Resto and Gas Station on 17 Ave SW.  This is no difference, being a knife, survival equipment and furniture upholstering store.

When you walk in, you can tell this place has been around for quite awhile on Macleod.  There's a bit of a feeling of nostalgia around, as you see the faded knife promotion posters, the dark lighting, and tons of hints here and there that scream of the great outdoors.  The cabinets of knives to the right,, the shelves of survival and camping equipment, and to the far left, a couple of easy chairs and sofas?  As I said, it's an odd little place.

Still, they have a good selection of knives and swords, and the people there know a bit about the art of sharpening. Prices are about in line with other places I've gone to, and not unreasonable. I wouldn't go here if you're looking for exceptional knives, such as Japanese steel or the best of the German brands, like Knifeware in Kensington or some of the specialty cooking knife places.  The brands here are primaryly for survival and day to day utility use.

I've had my swords sharpened there (yes, I have swords, I train in German sword combat) and never been disappointed.  As for the other services, well, if I ever need my sofa redone, I guess I'll find out.

ffy-OqIl37X84x0IKzY9-g,pHGeODl3kX1DO-L5p0-Kgg,We are still in the early part of treatment but thus far I have been very pleased with Dr. Mac. His staff is extremely pleasant and friendly.  Dr. Mac has been very kind and professional. I especially appreciate his interaction with my daughter. He is patient and willing to answer any questions or concerns. I am confident this is going to be a great experience.

I had never touched a sword before, and I had a wonderful time at the orientation class! I will be coming back for sure. I would recommend this place to anyone, any age, Boy or Girl!"
EsCSATOT6Nu2lThGbJCc0A,l86Q2onYOBF9fMtqgi2FMA,"Very dissatisfied with this service. I had purchased it with Groupon, and even paid for the double treatment. I see more spotting than before I came in for my appointment. After saying I had more spotting, the technician replied by saying ""don't be fussy"". Excuse me, these are my teeth, that's exactly why I am concerned. I would not recommend this place, even if you get it with Groupon at a lesser amount. Now have to find a dentist to fix what they have done."
jza5SqTdJQ4MfCCIuWWURw,gVUX2MpiPB3MmlDyu7CnfQ,"We had such an awesome time here! Sunday 3/11 we celebrated our dads birthday with this family fun activity, it was a hit! We loved every moment from coming in the front door and being greeted by the friendliest people,  SWAT style room sweeps, camera monitored movement and posted group and individual times. This is a super cool concept and will be returning to ""shoot up some bad guys"" and improve our times.  Sooo happy this is near us!"
YkoRLyCskO73WTQDmB4AAQ,WafSQBuSITsRVU9abHLNEw,"I don't work on my cars much but I do simple things like wipers and usually get my car batteries here. We bought a Duralast for our Honda Odyssey about 3 years ago and within about 18 months it died. They replaced it with a new battery and prorated most of the cost which I thought was reasonable but I was disappointed that the battery died so quickly. Flash forward 15 months and this new battery is now dead. So why the 5 star rating? After jumping the car and driving to my mechanic's shop I had the battery replaced there with an Interstate battery and took the old battery back to AutoZone, and even though it was beyond the 1 year replacement warranty they gave me a full refund with no hassle. The manager provided great customer service and turned what was a disappointing experience into a positive one. I probably won't buy another battery there but I will continue to use them for my other DIY items."
hVVi6XHWC-7RVZOvK1WpOw,-dcMx47YlENvORhSK62wTQ,Mom and pop place. Delicious. Friendly. Simple. I crave a sub from this fine establishment even as I type this.
KDbwtzo5vGKsUZyJKDeGTw,4inKvYHnzCLhp8Iw5Hx1YQ,"First of all always make an appointment online, to any of the quest . I went in around 1140 and it only had a handful of people. I am 30weeks pregnant and needed to get my glucose screening done . They called me up at 1143 and the check in clerk was very professional. Once I drank my glucose drink I had to wait an 1hr there's a nice wide butt seat next to the water fountain I sat there and was ready to wait. They seemed to be very quick calling people in. It seemed like they had a lot of staff to just keep it moving. The only issue I had was the blood technician I ended up with. She seemed like it was the last place on earth she wanted to be! She wasn't rude, but all the life was sucked out of her. She seemed like she just hated having to be there . She took a good minute to find my vein and even then didn't seem confident that she had found it . Well she ended up getting the blood but when I got home and took the bandage off she had popped the vein. Which is annoying . Everything went well except the tech I had. 


UPDATE: Today was my third time using this quest and a different lady blew a vein on this visit . That's twice out of the 3 visits! Very annoying, it seems like they are just guessing !"
NGs_bpPr5ve-GNcx2P6Zjw,OmhhELTj_gYPxJmB1OEJiA,"The studio was exactly what I was looking for.  I love that they have cycle and yoga classes.  The people are amazing and their extra touches, like providing spin shoes, don't go unnoticed."
GjPPxglvph5tCwdeYbjd_A,2T6vKPb4tif007T01n4DAw,"Everyone I dealt with, from the assistant to the doctor to the staff to help pick glasses out were incredibly kind. They called our insurance company to check on that before we came in also to help speed things up. High tech equipment not seen many other places for the eye exams. Great selection on glasses and we got a great deal for 50% off a complete pair at the time which saved us almost $400 so can't complain about that. Easy to make an appointment online, flexible times as well. $99 for a complete eye exam, lasted about 20 minutes."
O5WlH5h7LT03iWz6fqUb9A,UEAFk_WXhYBZYaJrmGXntA,"A traditional barber shop. It gave me visions of the place my granddad used to get his hair cut. It turns out, I was about spot on.

Let me admit for the record that I self identify as a ""cutesy fag,"" and concede that I was not expecting much from this experience.

Apprehensions aside, I chose to visit these folks because the shop is close to where I live, and because what I really needed was a shave, and they claimed to do that. I wear a chinstrap-ish sort of beard (think a young gay Abe Lincoln), and I'm bad at shaving my own face- I mess up the lines. I like to get a professional shave every once in a while so that my facial hair looks as presentable as the hair on the rest of my head does. I was excited to have found a place nearby home that offers this service.

It's true- they did not require an appointment, and there was absolutely no wait when I arrived. Even tho it was midday and midweek, that still should have told me something right away.

I went in intending on just the beard trim and face shave, but found myself asking for a hair cut as well when I arrived. How I wish I smoked less weed before leaving the house some days.

Again, I wasn't really expecting much from what was described as a ""traditional barber shop,"" so it wasn't such an outrage when I got home and found that my hairlines were uneven, that the back of my head had been all but forgotten, and that the hair on the top of my head, which is typically textured at some level, laid completely flat. I was already expecting to go see my stylist in Hendertucky anyway, so whatever, but just the same- really? My hair is not that challenging (I visit the stylist I usually do because I get to fantasize about chewing on his lips while he cuts my hair, not because he's SO amazing at his job), so it's always a shock to me when I find someone who butchers my head.

The beard trim was badly shaped- I had to fix it myself with a hand held razor when I got home. This is the reason why I paid to have this done in the first place- so that I did not have to worry about shaping it myself. Are you kidding me? Why am I standing in front of a mirror like this?

As if all this wasn't bad enough, the face shave was about as no frills as a face shave gets- no hot towel, no lotion on your face, just lather and go- and came about as close to my skin as an electric trimmer with no guide. I had to use a hand held razor to clean every inch of my face that had hair removed from it when I got home.

Fast? Sure. Cheap? Totally. If you're a very simple and very straight man, you probably won't even notice the assault that has been launched upon your person after a visit to this establishment. All others would be advised to take a step up and visit their nearest SuperCuts."
aReTtmCmNGP0nK3Wc6Whfw,X8e8BO1upiKIbfuX0Z1EIg,"This is the biggest scam! How is this a weight loss clinic with no scales ?! They just ask you what you weigh? Scam!  He said I would get my meal plan , exercise and recipes within a couple days. But It came in a couple of weeks.  The groupon said you get a special type of imaging. Well when I asked about it he said he didn't have the equipment for it and looked at me as though it was wrong to ask. This company need to be shut down!"
7NhLscBs-Cj2DfPyVdGrqg,7_u36HVwGPORwuqKWwnMEg,"I ordered a 3 topping pizza 11/15/2017 on the three topping for $7.99 deal. It was for pickup. My son picked it up but didn't look at it before he brought it home. When he got home I noticed that a topping was missing. When I called to report it, I was told they could make me another pizza or get a free pizza the next time we ordered. When I called tonight, the person answering the phone told me that the clerk reported or us to have two bread sticks or $2 of the pizza. I was very upset and told him he just lost a customer. He acted like he could care less. Well we will never order a pizza from them again."
gOj0n2yCw1p8WX_bmlyO2g,UzpHElxyPFIF0P5sx4t5gw,I've been working with Randy and his talented team for almost a year. The environment is professional yet comfortable and the finished deliverable is fantastic.

DLbpcBDn03Ly8Rn0HdfSQw,VrBphqK6OiqrVmWo9fcKww,I have played here three times. Me being a beginner to average golfer I like the fact that this place is affordable and comfortable for me to play not worry about slice into houses. Nice wide fairways. Carts come with coolers with ice and face towels.
YRv-K3mPJMFbAON4CqYySg,x7chemKt5twUWVO6uTIwRA,"So for the info of everyone on here, this place DID close for a couple of years and moved to another location, but has since re-opened and got a new paint job. However, the food remains the same. This is some of the most delicious chicken I've ever had, and I loves me some chicken. Super moist, decent portions (half of what you get is the side stuff, onions, jalapeno, salsa, lemons and a stack of tortillas). Salsa is pretty bomb. Although I'm not a huge fan of corn tortillas they are fairly yum and come very warm. You can get a 3 piece chicken, salsa, lemons, can of soda and tortillas for 5.00 plus tax. I just went and I believe they charge you 1.00 to use your debit/credit card since it cost 6.53 or so after tax, which they don't tell you about, and they use a Square card reader attached to a tablet, so use cash if you can. All around, I missed this place SO much when it left and I'm really glad it's back. I really hope this was helpful!"
Q8-OGdUV2T_AUXNou14Grg,aylRHwFuR3USCmdiQkjq8w,"I looked for a doctor referral for several years. I went into doctor clinics, pharmacist and they all said Dr White is in her own league of truly caring for her patients. Then through several general follow up appointments with other doctors I have heard 1st hand how she has saved lives with her attention to detail. I referred her to a colleague and it sounds like she helped her with a serious illness she wasn't aware of. She doesn't just push a bunch of papers around, she's aware of her patients and cares. Her staff is amazing(Tara?) She's in patient overload and is so knowledgeable and organized."
z0SeU7oBUzKHVt1NXTEJdA,RKcvUwivI0x3BG6DdyXPVw,"Loved their bracelets.  Natural stone jewelry is favorite of my family.  I bought all of my Christmas presents with these guys and I found the speed of delivery, their communication with me, and the prices outstanding."
vjLb7C5HRMDEBVqu6u84mA,ESpXQAJ_Bk46s38ZIpCAhQ,I love Nettleship. As long as I've lived in my neighborhood they've been my go to hardware store and family owned the customer service is amazing. I prefer Nettleship anytime over the home hardware down the street which I try to avoid at all costs. That being said I will always support them and go there first for all my hardware needs. Two thumbs up.
GVAnGPeVcSwYGU-DczjsaA,Lgy3LZ6lvlFcoXSpopGd1Q,Very pleasant for a date night. Ambiance and decor is very modern and fits perfectly with the mood . We ordered the eel and sake specialty which was amazing. Portions are perfect and will definitely think of this as my next go to sushi place for a night out with friends. It's a small restaurant so I suggest you reserve ahead of time to avoid waiting for a table :)
TxJCpcWVqSluQoNxFO_WQA,ktCCiL0oJiVy75Nu3qbelg,"Bought what I thought was a K&N air filter in 2016.  During my pm on  my bike the Air Filter gasket is ripped.  Its a K&N so it is warrantied for 1,000,000 miles.  I contact K&N for a replacement, and they inform me it is an HD filter and I will have to go to them for replacement.  I go the WRHD and I am told that it has a one year warranty.  I show him the receipt with the K&N clearly on it.  He tells me I am wrong.  He tells me that the gaskets always rip.  He tells me I torqued the filter done too much.  I tell him they did not give me what I paid for and they gave another filter that does not fit my FLHTCI.  He says i will give you a new filter at our cost of $40.  What happened to the $60 I already spent?  Now you know what happened to me.  I just want the right part and good quality....ho!d the attitude.  Am I expecting too much?"
aslYAND8FcQ9a9PGFPDjRQ,rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,"I'm using Dunn Edwards paint for the interior and exterior paint of my new home.  I came here for some samples and the employee was extremely helpful.  I asked for suggestions on paint quality and finish and got some great tips.  The paint samples were ready in less than 10 minutes and the employee even walked them to my car.  That was really nice.  

This location was able to help so much more than the one on S. Eastern.  My HOA sent me to any of the Dunn Edwards paint stores to see the palettes that were approved for painting the exterior of the house.  The other location told me they didn't have them on file.  The employee at this location showed my husband the website where we could access them online from home.  He said the other store should have shown us to this website and he wasn't sure why they didn't know about it.  

I don't have much to compare paint stores to but good service is a big deal in any industry, so I'd highly recommend this location for your paint needs!"
pnfN4L279fWamBW4-XKwXA,rNjgVKaBh1PlUA6dYB6EUw,"First impressions here were excellent.  

If you're not familiar with the concept, a USB is used to keep track of your progress, you choose your ""goals"", and the program does the rest of the work in formulating your workout.  The screens on the all-in-one weight training equipment and the mp3 players on the ellipticals and treadmills guide you through it.  The smart technology on the machines keeps track of your reps, strength, range of motion, etc.  All you have to do is show up (oh, and DO the workout).  Your information is recorded and you can review your workouts and progress online.  

The staff (we mostly worked with Lauren) were so great.  They are kind, patient, and encouraging teachers.  No judgment or intimidation here.  Just people who want to help you meet your goals.  The club is staffed 7 days and there is a key fob you can purchase to have access 24/7.

The club itself is spotless, uncluttered, and nothing like the typical ""gym"".  No mirrors up, down, and sideways... no people standing around watching themselves lift weights... no rows and rows of machines and fitness equipment to be confused and overwhelmed by.  But it offers everything you need to get a great workout and follow your ""plan"".  

I signed on for the year in my first session because the lifetime enrollment fee was waived.  It will be $79 a month with a year contract.  After the first year, it rolls into month-to-month.  If, during my 30 day groupon trial, I decide that this plan isn't for me, I can cancel without obligation.  

I'm looking forward to my no-nonsense, virtually guided workouts in this very calm and welcoming environment."

ZnI8ISFuiWC588bfEAXcEg,oADtO7rD3qZI08QWdr6JSA,"If I can put zero stars I would. My mother and i come here all the time never had a problem until today. We came today and brought my sis and my daughter with us today let me start off at this female working there name Salma just felt her vibe she wasn't to happy to be working. We ordered our food another lady there took our order. Everything was good until we had gave my baby sis money to give to a homeless man outside subway she came in and wanted to wash her hands but Salma was in there so she waited a good minute so Salma finally came out my sis and my daughter that's only 2yrs old they went to the bathroom my daughter screams a lot she's in her terrible two's... so Salma that was taking a customer order yelled across the room to tell my mom her kid's are playing in the bathroom my mom stood up and said they are not she's washing her hand's Salma said WELL THATS'S WHAT I AM HEARING after my mom walked away to get the kids. I'm starring right at her the man was going to pay for his food he wanted her to do the money a certain way she looked at him and said ill do it this way he looked at her and shook his head. Me and my mom was talking about it she paused and looked at us that's when I went up to her while she was about to take another customer order I simple asked her excuse me can I have your corporate office number and your name she paused gave me a rude look raised up her eyebrow and replied when ""IM DONE"" in a rude way so I told her I'll wait right here so I did. The lady paid and she looked back at me and said what can she help me wit so I replied your corporate office number and your name she said they don't have one but she can give me her name I said isn't it on your recipe because I work in a fast food myself I know! she said no so I asked for her boss number she walked in the back to get a card came back and said they ran out that she can give me the number on the recipe I asked will she be in tomorrow she paused again wit her attitude and said Monday at 7am not tomorrow and walked away that's when I got fired up and said have a wonderful f***** day she replied God bless you and laughed... I don't understand people that's your job honey if you don't like it don't work for it. I know talking to the manager won't solve anything but they do need to know."

T6KTog5vcMaw1USppX82MA,t1iQ7_HCRUGBx0wokIy1Jw,"I have started to frequent various pool stores lately now that I own a house with a pool.  Recently I had to have some work done on the pool pump system that involved replacing the housing for the in floor sequencer.  I know that there are not a great deal of pool stores around the valley but I came in here because I used to live in the area and it is close to work for me.

The guy that helped me was fantastic.  I didn't have much to go on other than a brand name and generic information about what was needed (provided by my pool guy).  He was able to look up the information for me to see what was needed and how much.  He didn't have all of the parts on hand but was willing to call another store to check inventory for me so I wouldn't have to wait for a new piece from the factory.  Luckily they had one out in Gilbert so I was able to head out there and pick up the remaining piece.

I will definitely be back to this location.  It is very clean and well kept and so far the service has been excellent."
-7jfn3wrS_grXiYbefKucQ,EXEZSuwQEZ0HTPPua_qXHw,"I am so unbelievably displeased with this franchise location.  We have many, valuable, original pieces of art, as well as art glass and treasures from around the world.  When we moved from Scottsdale to South Carolina we used Craters and freighters and they were wonderful.  Everything was professionally wrapped, they made boxes with partitions to protect the art and everything arrived in pristine condition.  As a result, when we moved from the Carolinas to Santa Fe we called the local franchise to move our things again.  I am dumbfounded.  We had kept all of the previous boxes and wrapping material and carefully labeled everything thinking it would make this move easier.  Instead, these people taped numbers to every piece, so when I pulled off the tape paint came with it.  They ruined pottery, broke art glass, ruined 5 frames and in general did a terrible job.  These people clearly don't know art. They bubble wrapped everything, five to ten pieces per package and that was it.  They charged over $2000 for something I could have done better, faster and less expensively.  I don't usually write scathing reviews.  I like to be positive, but this is unbelievable.  I gave them one star because zero isn't an option."
sOnVEg7luLkqmDvIBp9PFA,i_EASSNcEqc1JrfdBjBeVw,"The thrill of the hunt! I always find something good here. Its a big store with lots of racks decently organized but be warned, this does make it busy! To find the good stuff you have to go often but its worth it to find that gem for one dollar! They have vinyls pretty often and if you go through them, be a dear and put the broken or missing ones aside. Also don't forget to donate your items here instead of throwing them away. It's the circle of life! (cue Lion King music...)"

gULbW9hclf3N3HQLxFH5_Q,sYauKfRBquRxDwHA1a8EsA,"Ok, I cannot seem to find a friggin laptop cord that will charge my 5 year old laptop (I know, I know, that's like 10 trillion years in technology years, I must be some cheap ass fruit for not throwing this one into the heap at the dump and conforming to mass consumerism. I am an idiot who does not deserve to find a replacement power cord. But I digress...).

So, after determining that I would only find universal crappy cords that would not work on eBay, Hubby and I decided to bite the bullet and... actually drive to a store... and buy one- just like we used to in the good 'ol days.

This Radioshack is very near to our house so we swung in. Much to my surprise, there were 2 very helpful women working the floor. They even opened packages and attempted to charge the laptop while we were there. We wound up spending $108 (on a stupid cord which we later found out  powers the laptop but doesn't actually seem to charge it, so I guess it will be going back) and walked out decently happy.

So, even though overpriced and not perfect, I guess technically we got what we needed and the service was pretty good. On a side note, I am only giving the overall experience 4 stars- for some reason every experience I have ever had with a Radioshack indicates that it attracts douches (I hope this isn't a reflection on me going there). There was a total jerk customer who was jerky to my little boy and kept saying stupid things like ""WOW, this is a LOT of batteries for $9.99, what would I even DO with ALL these batteries??"". Yes, jerk, it is a good deal. Don't buy them if you don't need them. And a weird guy with a boy who seemed be trying super hard to seem super smart and know-it-all-ish. Great, I don't need to know that your dumb parents saw fit to give you a cell phone at the ripe old age of 9 or that you understand blue tooth technology. 

Anyway, its not Radioshack's fault that they have moronic customers, but it is a tribute to their outdated marketing, store displays and organization, and somewhat lame variety of slim pickins cell phones and remote control Tonka Trucks. If they would just try a bit harder to join this century instead of making time stand still they would probably do better.

But what do I know, this is all just my opinion. Anyone know where a loser can get a functioning power cord for a 10 trillion year old Gateway laptop?"
rP9s8HuQRsch-E6yke8-kg,yoaw1D8PUohh0K1eHaM3Hw,"Went to get an oil change today I had scheduled at this location. They refused to do it unless I paid to upgrade to their preferred synthetic blend.  Bait and switch considering I booked the appointment with a coupon for the conventional oil change. This used to be a neighborhood auto service place. Too bad Pep Boys took over and made it a turn-off.  I took it to Cobblestone instead for $19.99.

Update: went back and showed them the owners manual that said I didn't need their upgrade. They didn't budge."

Believe it or not I don't like spend that much money on a shirt. However, it was as soft as a baby's ---.  It was love at first touch.  TOUCHDOWN,

And then ! I got lazy and took it to Cohen cleaners to be washed and ironed.  I did not go there because of the price. I went there because it's very close to where I live. I went to pick it up today and the woman handed it to me saying that it was ripped.  She pointed to a large tear on the right shoulder.  When I asked her what happened, she said ""it rip because fabric cheap.""  Take a deep breath ARCANGELA!!   Yes, cheap....she said my Michael Kors shirt was cheap.  She then proceeded to hand me $2.29 and left.

I give them NO STARS.  NO STARS FOR YOU!  We all know I could not share if I don't star.  Go here at your own risk and if you do, don't bring cheap shirt."

He doesn't make you come back frequently which is optimal for me since I am not very compliant.  I have been his yearly patient for years, but now that I am older I do need to go back a little more often.  Go to him for a consult, you will be happy you did."

When I still hadn't heard back from her nearly 24 hours later, I followed up with her over the phone and she was able to only give me a price, without any details or renting options.  She then assured me that she would e-mail me specific details within the hour.  Two hours later I still hadn't received anything, so I called once again.

Bill called me within a half hour and we talked about prices and the fact that it is a holiday weekend.  Anyway, in the mean time he called Angel who called me and I had my fat cat door installed within a half an hour.

I know, it sounds super lazy because it's not that far to walk up to the door... Truth is, the door into the bank and ATM are on the back side of the bank from the visible street side, so that makes it kind of isolated... That does not give me a huge feeling of comfort...

PyCIUFtJd_nvR5lSxrWX3A,vbZZw6tZgH8PNu6NLcK6Sg,"We stopped in on opening day.  We missed the morning festivities which was probably a good thing.  Considering there was still a lot of people well into the closing hours, it must have been a madhouse in the daytime.

Simons (or La Maison Simons) has been in business since 1840 originating from Quebec City.  Since then their move out west has seen them open up their largest store in Edmonton.  The West Edmonton Mall location has been a staple of mine since they opened in 2012.  Every time I go to Edmonton I have to stop in, even just to look at what's new.

Being a larger man of Asian origin there aren't many things that fit me here; however,  I can appreciate the styles and labels they carry.  I quite often come out of a Simons empty handed but still happy because I was able to get a good dose of ideas I can take with me.

Although not as big as the West Edmonton Mall location, the Calgary store boasts over 90,000 sq. ft. on four levels in the revitalized Lancaster Building.  The first two floors house women's fashions with part of the second floor dedicated to a cafe and home decor/accessories.  The cafe actually looked like they have decent food.  The third and fourth floors have men's clothing, with the top floor dedicated to suits and clothing of the formal variety.

It's interesting to see how they integrated the store so that it seamlessly transitions from the Lancaster Building to the Core Shopping Centre and as well as the adjoining plus 15.  It doesn't feel like a big department store but, more of an eclectic combination of smaller boutique shops.

I'd have to say Simons hits all the good notes except for one, I think some of the prices are a bit too high considering a lot of this stuff is manufactured in China.  Don't get me wrong, I think the store, it's employees and its merchandise is great; just that, I think a bit more diversified pricing on something other than printed tees are in order.

Welcome to Calgary!"

The server was quite nice and always smiling.  I'll be back here again!

I forgot to mention that the air quality in here is quite good especially for an Indian restaurant.  I didn't walk out smelling like curry and it didn't linger into my clothes, as like most Indian restaurants."

Prices are reasonable and variety is good.  Staff is friendly and always accomodating to see if you need help or have questions.  F2 Furnishings is also a Canadian company."

0PE0mno-0KlOeEqAYOkBXQ,zQxEZh2K1e-BUb8n6QXLSg,"If I could rate zero stars I would. Very very disappointed and frustrated with this tour company. We booked the Quebec City day tour and Montmorency Falls for our family of 4 for May 25th. We were visiting our son who is studying in Montreal and travelled from Spain and that was our only free day. We booked the tour the previos day, maybe less than 24 hours ahead, but nonetheless we could make the payment and apparently book the tour. We followed the instructions and the following day went to the reception of our hotel to print the voucher 20 minutes earlier than our scheduled pick up time which was 7:45 at Auberge du Vieux Port. What was our big big disappointment  when we were waiting and 5 minutes after pick up time and nobody came. The issue was that apparently we were supposed to call the company to confirm the pick up 24 h earlier! ...but this information was only written in the printed voucher which we didn't have until we printed it in the morning. Summing up, we called GrayLine to see if we could meet with the bus driver somewhere and they said no that bus was on his way to Montreal. We tried to get our money back and they offered a trip next day, but next day was impossible for us because we had other plans and our son was unable to come because of his studies. We asked for our money back or at least half of it and GrayLine said that was out of question .... that they didn't return any money after payment of tour! . This is very misleading for the customer,  we felt victims of a tourist in fraud! ! How is it possible that you can make a full payment online for 4 people ( Totalling 400 Canadian $) and they don't inform you of this ""little issue"" leading to the lose of a day tour and full payment! This is a total theft, no other name for it! . We are contacting the ""Office de la Protection du Consimmateur"" of Montreal Quebec, to see what we can do to obtain at least a compensation. 
Be ware of this company !"

Sy9XPnOgEr7PemrYPWB7yw,Kf10dTiGlcnyhj8DBoZn1A,"They seriously need to get their act together. Uninspired food and menus. Food tastes like it has been slapped together by a novice who hasn't cooked before. Salads are just lettuce, carrots, tomatoes and cucumber mostly. I got the asian sesame one day, and just told the lady to not add the fried stuff to it (not-so-fit-for-life stuff). She asked me if I wanted onions and tomatoes and I said ""yes please"". All I got was lettuce with some carrots and a lot of dressing. Given that there are such few express food counters around here, I've eaten here a few times, and always been super disappointed with my food.

The Yonge-Eglinton full service location is far better (except the greasy not-so-fit-for-life daily specials which is mostly noodles), but this one is the pits."

For the most part, some things are available, but not very exhaustive, probably given the store size. There is some fresh fish in a room at the back but I've never bought fish here so don't know much. Basic dals, spices etc are readily available. Some specific products and brands are often not available, but I find that to be the case with many Indian/ Pakistani/ Sri Lankan stores."
XXo6JbN_i_WpsXp_C5zPPg,9Whz5AGTTAXn1ID9SmbxHw,"Madison Circus Space is really a unique place! 

I have taken two 5-week sessions of Introduction to Aerial Silks, and am planning to continue because the classes are so fun and are an excellent workout as well as a great way to break me out of the usual. I had Jess as an instructor and she is an amazing teacher -- She knows how to break up difficult steps and how to encourage everyone to try things that may feel challenging without being pushy at all. She facilitates such a positive atmosphere in the class that as a student I felt really good when she and the other students would clap and encourage each other. The class has a great progression and doesn't move too fast or slow. I am so excited to continue working on my technique!

I have also attended a couple circus shows at Madison Circus Space. They are nothing short of impressive (especially after you've tried a particular art and you realize JUST how challenging it is!). The tickets are usually very affordable and sometimes baked goods are sold and goodies are given away. Again, the atmosphere feels super happy and encouraging of everyone. 

To be a member, you have to be in classes for a couple years and pass a test, but I definitely recommend reaching out to see if there is a class you would like to try. You can attend one class to try before committing to a full session, which is a great idea because these acts are very new to most of us!"

-vQUXh5zfEfTQFTe5w27kA,kMydZVuwPGVVzj85wnONHg,"Rocket Cycle is a fabulous spin studio!  I've tried spin a couple of times in the past but I never really took to it as much - the classes seemed to drag on and weren't particularly enjoyable, so I was a bit apprehensive when I first went to Rocket Cycle.

The staff is great - they set me up with spin shoes and helped me adjust my bike.  The also have other instructors on hand to help with bike adjustments.  Towels are available and you'll receive a reusable water bottle at your first class.

The class itself was fantastic - super high energy instructor (Scott) who had an equally high energy music - he had us dancing on our bikes!  The class is well modulated, with sprints and climbs and recovery rides in between.  They turn off the lights periodically, so you can close you eyes and go as fast as you can, with nobody to watch you; the music's turned up so even if you grunt with effort, nobody can hear you.  This is my favourite part of the workout.

They do a series of arms workouts with hand weights towards the end of the class and you can get different ones depending on how strong you are!

There's a nice little stretch at the end of the class, although I would recommend you stretch some more on your own!

I've taken about half a dozen classes here now, and have tried different instructors.  Scott is my favourite because I especially enjoy his choice of music.  Rory is great too - well modulated class with great music...and I rather like his calm, steady demeanour!  I've taken Sari's classes a couple of times and appreciate just how much she focuses on technique - lots of different muscles worked in her class.  Definitely take hers.   Dana is the founder, and has a rather aggressive, up in your face style.  She is super high energy, which is great to see, but the music is on so loud that I can't hear her instructions, which I found frustrating.  The class was packed though, so clearly her style appeals to many.

Other things to note - there isn't much room to change - most people seem to come in already dressed.  They have spin shoes so you don't need to buy your own; each pair is sprayed with disinfectant between uses.  There are lockers with key codes, so you don't need a lock. You can sign in using one of the iPads at the front. Oh and if you create an account on their website, you can reserve a bike of your choice.

Overall, great workouts - I leave feeling really great and intend to keep going!"
9JtXj6oWahPAeg2ZsWxTHA,BrrV9gpbFKFR5NqIn8T2zw,"I love working with Bruce! When buying my first motorcycle, I enlisted Bruce's help in 2014 when I was evaluating bikes listed on Craigslist. I wanted to make sure I bought something that was in good condition and I was too much of a novice to trust my own judgement. Since then, I've turned to Bruce almost every time I've needed routine maintenance, repair, or a parts change. Because I want to understand the mechanics of the bike and learn to diagnose and address issues, Bruce lets me tackle the work, guiding me with advice and lending a hand whenever needed. And where some men question whether a woman can wrench (consciously or otherwise) and would step to rescue her from a perfectly manageable situation, Bruce does not. I've recommended him to many friends, both female and male, who are looking for a quality mechanic.

And full disclosure, you might spy me working on my bike, a 2002 Honda Shadow 600 nicknamed Gonzo, in one of the pics. Speaking of which, I due to get back in for a fork seal and fluid replacement."

They have always handled getting prior authorization from my insurance company for my treatment.

I find the price of the washers and dryers pretty reasonable.

Broken machines are usually well marked.  I like the parking lot and that there are two doors to the business.  There is a Milio's in the same complex so if you need lunch or dinner you don't have to drive around.  And now a Tattoo and Piercing Shop, so maybe get some ink while you are washing."

This is not meant to be a parking lot. The space is filled with nails and your car may see issues with its tires as a result. Since there is only one lane to get in.

Rather than thin measly deli meat, the Doughbelly provides butcher block cuts of roasted meat. So very fulfilling, especially if you are hungry. We got Doug's Club and Buffalo Chicken, both of which was delicious. Though Doug's Club was an obvious specialty.
In addition we got the D-B French Fries, which has the special D-B seasoning. Yup that was good. Lastly we had a small side order of wings, which was good. That was the only thing I would not say is exceptional. 
The decor is what you'd expect from a sub restaurant: simple, clean with two TVs.

It was recommended by a friend and I came in with no appointment for a teeth cleaning. Since it was my first time visiting the receptionist was very sweet and asked me to fill out the forms for my information and medical history. 

There were several people waiting when I came in but I was able to be seen after a short wait. I went through the usual teeth x rays and they took the x rays in the same room I had my teeth cleaned which was a nice tough since I've been to other dentists where there was only one x ray room I was brought to before being brought to another room for the cleaning.

My dentist was very nice and did everything in a thorough manner. I thought it was nice of them to check my comfort level throughout the teeth cleaning asking if I was uncomfortable or if anything hurt.

Overall I had a great experience and was given a small gift package containing floss, toothbrush, and toothpaste.

There isn't a section with quiet studying that can actually hold more than 25 people. The section they have is quite small and enclosed that you would actually feel claustrophobic. It has free Wifi which I guess is a good thing going and the only thing going for this library. The staff has changed over the years and now it is friendlier than what it used to be. The upstairs area with more study tables and computers is usually filled with teenagers and their highschool drama of fighting or making out. I think this library needs a face-lift and it's been in the waiting for some time now.

I really expected more since  I had heard good things, but the sides (probably one of the most important things about soul food) were really under-seasoned and didn't have that slap yo' mama taste that I had been expecting. Also, there were a lot of things on the menu that were not ready or made yet which was a bit disappointing as my family had been looking forward to certain items.

This is our experience we had with Robert West. My wife is from Canada and we got married where I am from Las Vegas we had went to a few lawyers before we found Robert and we knew deep down in are hearts these lawyers were not helpful, they all seem like they just wanted one thing ... Your money and they didn't even care about us. Something inside wasn't right with these Las Vegas immigration Attorneys that we talked too, a lot of them seemed very shady as well. So finally we came across Robert West !!! Set up an appointment to go talk to him, he was a very legit guy and he really cared for us and wasn't all about the business and that's what makes me different. We then hired him and no joke five months later my wife got her social number and 14 days after that we had are immigration interview. It was all a very fast process, and Robert came with us to the immigration interview and he helps prepare you very well!! He knew all the immigration officers there so it made the interview go smooth !! Guess what we got approved !  We really recommend you hiring Robert he is very knowledgable, experienced and trustworthy !! Thanks Robert for being our lawyer :) . For anyone who reads this I promise you he's worth it."

There are many other places who will treat you right in the area. I understand waiting, but the attitude and tone of this establishment was unwelcoming"
vZTlNvgndhebyi126_pZ5w,byS5I9HMlMqjiTrjqnCscg,At Growth Nation we're very particular on the vendors we use for photography.  Right now there are only two because of high quality and good price - and one of those is Rick Mueller Photography.  Rick has been in business here in Scottsdale since the 1970's (!) and he continues to bring value to his clients. Highly recommended.

St. John's offers one of the most authentic family friendly Christian experiences you can find.  You won't find much pretentiousness here in my experience.  Here, mostly people are just trying to work out their own Salvation.  Hospitality is awesome. They even offer a free meal every Sunday following the services.  If you're looking to learn and grow in your relationship with God, I found this place to be the closest thing to where I believe Saints Peter and Paul would attend.  Loved it!"
qLSlpf6j-W4HxZ1MYVhExw,rPJZ0Bh1Dj-Rw6Yu3iQwVQ,Super easy to find and also super nice inside. The customer service is great and love how they have a huge printing section inside. Everything is also always very neat and organized which is great and makes finding everything easy.
KISNjnQaKGzmGritl_5OoQ,GLl5m-CI-5DvKuZhN7HUuQ,"I have been happy with the food but I  no longer am going back. I was with 8 other women and we go to this restaurant at least once a month. My friend asked for a little extra sauce on her meal and was charged an extra amount. After years of going to this restaurant they have decided to charge everyone an extra $1 for using a debit or credit card. I just find this outrageous in a world where almost everyone uses plastic.
The parking situation is dangerous if you need to park in the back. 
I must compliment the servers and the chef but the management/owners obviously are not interested in return customers."

I don't want to scare anyone but unless they sterilize their equipment after every usage, I wouldn't trust any outfit that doesn't simply because of how nail funguses are spread via poorly sterilized nail equipment.
That said, the manicures and pedicures here are great, even if you have difficult nails like I do. They are very thorough and in case you get shellac gel work done on your nails, keep the receipt because so long as you do, they'll take it off for free."
huT2WfQqf2AXdyOAmzGYWA,ReDypdRmVA3wc-QG8HBKkQ,"Wonderful local Mom and Pop store which specializes in fruits and veggies.

Everything inside is laid out and lit beautifully and you can tell that the staff here take pride in their work. With an emphasis on locally-grown Quebec produce in the summer, this shop also has dairy products, cheeses, breads, pasta, spices, honey and stir-fry sauces and marinades for sale.

While selection isn't as wide as say Jean Talon market, for a small local spot, Vert Pomme has just enough to tide you over. I love stopping by here after work and picking up a few fresh odds and ends to get dinner going.

Prices vary according to the seasonality of the produce, but in general are quite reasonable. While last month it was strawberries, it's corn season now, so they're practically giving it away."

The pizza's alright. The location, as I said, is ideal. I remember my roommates raving about some really cheap special they had with poutine and a drink and  I recently noticed, from the sign I saw *through* the window, that they still have that. They must be doing something right, cuz they've been here longer than I have.

I think it might be the sign, with its ridiculous name and even *more* ridiculous picture of a BABY sitting in the pizza box!? What do any of these things have to do with each other??! Therein lies the reason I hope they never leave my neighbourhood. I love it now as much as I did the day I moved in."

After bad luck with another stylist, I was even more paranoid and worried about the quality of work.  Chuentil SLAYS!!!  It was probably the best experience I've had since I moved to Arizona.  Customer service is 100%.  Being a California girl, I was worried the salons here wouldn't even come close.  My hair looks amazing and my man can't keep his hands off.  If you want some great extensions, with volume and an all-around sexy super star look, make an appointment with Infinite Hair Gallery TODAY! So glad I've finally found someone this skilled! :)"

When you lose your passport, all sorts of stupid bureaucratic policies get thrown at you, including having a Statutory Declaration letter notarized. 

I have been putting this off for months but with a trip to NYC planned at the end of the summer my procrastination was put on notice.

The secretary and the notary were sweet, friendly and even cracked jokes with me... Ikea lineups for meatballs are more stressful than this place. My service cost $20 and I was in and out of this office in less time than it took my father to circle the block to find parking.

I hope to never have to go through Passport woes again but if I do I know where to go!"
StSCYcx3VhHnm4k9lxn9Kw,2VKVhy1SwaixHCeiWglLUQ,"I should start by saying that Lakay is Toronto's only Haitian restaurant... and it's not your typical ""Caribbean"" eatery. I grew up eating Haitian food my entire life and as far as I am concerned they deliver. This is my soul food and I can't help but smile every time I eat here... it feel like home in a way. I recommend Griot which is deep fried pork cubes.  The portions are quite generous and I always have to bring the left overs home.

The only reason I won't give this place a perfect five-star rating is because aesthetically the place looks sort of ghetto! If you can get over tacky paintings and plastic trays you'll have an awesome meal :-)

Oh and they have 3 domestic bottles of beer for $10... that is sort of a sick deal!"

The clinic itself is in a basement space, and simply just has a sketchy feeling to it. Sadly, I spent about $1000 at this place before I realized how unprofessional it was. The receptionists are very young and seem quite immature to do this job. I would not recommend coming here, ever."
sJF25JZ8gBAcrxN3YxNh1Q,JrxI_CAGJfaICZdlxwSBAw,I have worked with Josh Goldberg for over 7 years.  He is the best mortgage broker I have ever worked with.  He is extremely detail oriented and is always searching for ways to get the best deal for his client.  He is very good at managing the process with the bank and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks.  I have referred him to my friends and family who all have had very good experiences with him.  I would recommend him to anyone!
ZBow_7ssh7tWEAyLIrKGtg,NAZzgDkNIL_DpHg6xu9APQ,"I say 5 stars are in order.  My  father-in-law passed away and my mom-in-law wanted to have lunch after the service, at the cemetery as the cemetery was right up the road. She chose Woody's. The staff, Dawn, was absolutely amazing! I called to get everything set up and it went off perfectly. Dawn was caring and compassionate. She made sure we were well taken care of. She was a pleasure to deal with. We got there a little later than we expected but they were ready. The food was warm and good, needed sustenance for our emotionally drained bellies. We needed food and they did a phenomenal job. My mom-in-law chose the two entree buffet option. She picked roast beef and boneless breaded chicken for the entrees. You get rolls, salad, a veggie (she chose glazed carrots), potatoes (she chose roasted red skin parsley), and a pasta (penne). They give you the option to add desserts for an additional cost (she said yes) and open or cash bar (it was a no in our case). And the bevvies were included. Other than the roast beef being quite dry, everything else was amazing! Good flavor on everything. Everything was cooked amazingly well, again, other than the roast beef. The chicken was tender. Pasta was nicely done. Carrots and potatoes were cooked but not overly, no mush here. The desserts were so good. There were a few to choose from (a banana cake, canolli cake, peanut butter pie, and creamsickle cake. The rave was the creamsickle). I chose the pb pie and while rich just yummy! I also tried the canolli cake which was less rich and not so sweet, still terrific though. And the waitress that was serving was simply amazing. No one's glass was ever empty and she did it and you didn't even notice. She was perfect. It was an awesome way to wrap up a horrible few days. Remembering the man we lost, but knowing he no longer suffers, that is something...we will definitely miss him and we will never stop loving him. He was an amazing man and made the man I married an amazing man. Thank you Woody's for your compassion and understanding and awesome food for our day of remembrance!"

They are not as dense as your usual pretzel bread and the taste is spot-on. My favourite way to eat them was toasted with butter but they also make a good sandwich.
I am giving them 5 stars solely because these bagels need no improvement. I will be visiting their location for sure."

By now management should have it down packed. But its not. Super slow. And unattentive. And their famous fresh bread well its still good but try getting your hands on them. They give one piece per person. Which is not enough when the whole basis of lebanese breakfast is dipping your bread in foul or fatteh or eggs. These breads should be rolling out nonstop on a busy sunday. But no we had to ask few times and wait meanwhile eating our eggs and foul with a spoon. Management please get it together,  your food is good but service and organization lacks. Hopefully my next review is 5*."

It felt kinda like the DMV only with carpeting and a big TV to watch. At first I felt real impatient and thought I should leave as they only had one person working and the first customer was taking forever. I was number 64 and we were at number 50. If only I had brought my knitting. If only I had knitting stuff. Ahhh...the TV, Jags vs. Dolphins....could care less, but athletic men in tight uniforms is a sweet deterrent from perusing the stoic and impatient faces that filled the room. Soon another employee arrived and another and so on. Like that shampoo commerical from the 80s. ""Number 64""....oooo that was moi. My bill paying was handled by Odin quickly, politely and professionally as was my purchase of my HD/DVR box. . All said and done I'd rather be at Cox than the DMV any ole day!"

I always felt good about shopping at a local business but the lack of customer service finally did it for me. The place isn't kept up well and they are just not nice.

The beds are always available, and its the first time I have been a member at a salon, where I never had to wait. I have been tanning in total for 7 years- and I'd have to say, in all my experience, that I would recommend this salon over any of the rest."

gQ9qXrLNnowN6YrGhJFTYQ,eVufnL_jVKhqqeaAfysgCw,"Well, I don't treat myself to fast food often. Having said that I am sorely disappointed in this Arby's. The dining room is just awful. Looks like it is from the 60s with minimal upkeep. I made my order to go because of this....fact there isn't a BATHROOM indoors? What...the...fuck? Cmon, arbys, get it together!
    The restrooms are located outside the building, not readily visible or available. I lacked the interest in finding out how to gain access to them because I hate asking for a key from the cashier....and also, it's 100 degrees outside. Save that nonsense. 

Oh, here's another note too: have sauce pumps that actually work too!  I like a lot of sauce so I decided to use the pumps to add some extra to my sandwich. No, sorry. The horsey sauce is broken. This run down dump won't last much longer than the one that just closed on Rainbow Rd if they keep this nonsense up. 

I don't want to seem like I'm super negative so I will also say that the food I did indulge in was super, as it always is at any arbys I go to. The staff was also quite polite and nice to deal with."

This year I had Dave go to my son's home. This was even more difficult. Because of settling Dave had difficulty getting the slider door out. He reworked the track so it didn't have to be replaced. Dave spent a lot of time at this job and even put in double wheels for stability.

I had to call and email and finally someone called back and said due to weather they pushed us back a week. A week later came and nobody showed. After pestering them again someone called and said they will be out and they finally showed and did half the job and said they would returned tomorrow. They never did. I'm hoping they return Monday. Hoping for the best. My neighbors have their fences by them and they appear to do great work. Seems like they just work when they feel like it.

HHwoMfAReRiuSxQhVjIELw,YRcaNlwQ6XXPFDXWtuMGdA,"From a ""one stop shop"" point of view, this shopping centre is great. There are tons of stores from groceries, to hardware, to food, to clothing. However, from a traffic flow view, this place is a nightmare. The shopping centre is accessible by 3 entrances from 130th Ave and one on 52nd street. Everyone seems to only use the entrance/exit on 46th street which has a 4-way stop immediately once you turn off of 130th. Do yourself a favour and hit the next set of lights to get in or out of this place. 

4-stars for the shopping selection.
1-star for the gong-show of traffic planning."
67NyrhujAlXTqdsxmtDNyQ,YRcaNlwQ6XXPFDXWtuMGdA,"Wow, not surprising I had a bad experience at their auto service centre.  I brought my car in for a simple door window fix.  The initial repair took 14 hours of my day for 1.5 hours of labour.  Then I had to bring my car back a couple of days later twice in the same day because they wouldn't listen to what I was telling them was the problem I was experiencing.

They accused me of saying that I had requested specific parts be replaced and they did the work as requested, where all I did was bring my car to them and asked them to fix it and authorized them to replace the parts they recommended.

Unless you are getting something simple done like getting new tires or an oil change I would stay away from this service centre.  The two different staff members that I dealt with were friendly to me but overall VERY rude to most of the customers that came through while I was sitting in the waiting area.

I don't want to tarnish Canadian Tire's rapport in general as I've had good experiences at other service centres, just not this specific location."
vjLb7C5HRMDEBVqu6u84mA,YRcaNlwQ6XXPFDXWtuMGdA,"I just briefly popped into this place and unfortunately they didn't have what I needed.  It's a pretty small store with mostly paint and painting supplies. It seems like they mostly cater to contractors based on their weekday business hours.

Either way, the guy who helped me was great. He made a few suggestions on where I could go to find what I needed."

The people at Camelback Orthodontic Studio, particularly Sherry and Ryan, have made the experience much less painful (pun intended). They are super friendly, super professional, and they really know their stuff. An experience that stands out was with Sherry. She was working to put on my braces (yes, I'm 41 and have braces). She commented on how excited she was to put my braces on, and explained to me just how confident she was in her ability and the process, based on her experience. And, she did a fabulous job. Ryan, the office manager, sends me regular check-in emails and assures that I make all my appointments. He explained the process to me, and made me feel comfortable in my initial decision. They have a great team and do great work! - Gerald"

I felt like a horrible mother for not attending to her teeth the way I should. They reassured me it's very commen and not to feel bad, they also coached me on proper brushing teqniques. The staff was wonderful, they were all so friendly and my daughter felt so comfortable seeing the dentist. The dentist is scary enough for most grown men and women however especially scary for  children but they went above and beyond to make the experience for both her and I more than wonderful.

BuGweXjpqEo_5ovBHd-7zQ,H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,"While I don't review a lot of fast food places, I felt the need to talk about this one as it brings forth a point that I make about any and all fast food restaurants.

But first....  I'm not so much a fan of Wendy's burgers.  Flavor wise, they just don't do it for me.  I am, however, a fan of their chicken nuggets.  And I appreciate the variety on their dollar menu.  My recent discovery, the Cheesy Cheddar Burger is decent.  Not great, but certainly decent, and doable when you need a quick bite.

The place also gets points for having a nice staff.  I've had good experiences with the staff through every transaction here, and they are helpful and friendly.  I don't ask for a lot, but they do a fine job.

So what is this ""point""?  I don't eat fast food vegetables.  Period.  And I was reminded this when I tried their value menu Chicken Caesar Wrap.  I guess you could point out a ""Well, what do you expect for a dollar"" comment, but I DON'T expect brown, wilty lettuce.  So I turned my meal into a chicken wrap, minus the caesar.  

Heh.  I guess you could say that I came to bury caesar, not to praise him.  Come on.  Groan all you want, but I had a great opportunity to add that.  How could I not?

Well, Wendy's, we'll always have chicken nuggets...."
gQ9qXrLNnowN6YrGhJFTYQ,H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg,"The funny thing about this Arby's, as well as the neighborhood it resides in, is that everything here feels like it comes out of a time warp set firmly in the 1970's-1990's.  And this Arby's is no different.

This place looks very old-school.  Old style logo, old-style restaurant and building with seating.  I normally don't make much note of a fast food design, but this place is decidedly retro.  Whether it was intentional, or just part of the aforementioned ""time warp"" effect, who can say?

But people don't want to come to a restaurant review page for architecture.  They want to know how the food is.  And the food here is actually pretty decent.    As I kid, it was a highlight for me to get Arby's when we went out of town, and now having one so close to home is really nice, considering the old love for the place.

I've noticed that Arby's has been changing up their selections, adding some non-roast beef selections (fish sandwich, anyone?), but their sandwich fare are generally enjoyable. 

The real perk for me has always been the Beef 'N' Cheddar.  I could probably eat four of those sammiches, and the food is done well here.  Not to mention the service is consistently dependable.  The staff is conversational and friendly, my orders have remained correct, and there never has been an outstandingly long line.

If there's a downside, Arby's has grown increasingly expensive over the years.  Just because you're getting fast food does not mean that you're getting cheap food.  Fortunately, Arby's coupons hit my mailbox with some regularity, so it's not an issue.  Still, I do miss the days of ""5 for $5"".

Respectable food, decent service, and somewhat pricey.  That's the Arby's experience, alright."

I got the black Samsung Galaxy S4 wrapped with the red carbon fiber ghost armor and it looks badass. Unfortunately I hate their warranty policies, they make ""lifetime"" seem awesome but when in reality everyone upgrades their phone every contract and unless u get the exact same model phone ur ghost armor warranty is useless and ur gonna end up paying out in full all over again. Not to mention all the little fees u get hit with for 'labor' if ur material gets messed up or u need something changed. Not to mention this shit is insanely overpriced! They probably mark up their material 10x if not more. I mean $50 for a screen and back, thin clear plastic w a little adhesive? Thats more than double a phone case made with triple the material. Fuck me.... Unfortunately I love how it looks and run straight there everytime I get a phone, I just hate knowing im getting completely ripped off, I just don't know of anything else visually comparable to their 'carbon fiber' looking material. So for me its a love/hate relationship. I give 3 stars bc their employees were cool, quick, and helpful. The only thing that kept it from 5 stars is their bullshit pricing and warranty gimmicks,  I feel sorry for ppl thinking their lifetime warranty is legitimate, if u have the money to spend go for it, just beware ur probably gonna end up spending a lot more in the future if u plan on sticking with ghost armor"

However, do expect to pay a lot more for better-looking plants (i.e a $20 hydrangea at Canadian Tire would be $40 here). The staff here are friendly and are very knowledgeable so don't hesitate on asking about the plants.

There are no salepersons! no one will try to sell you any personal training packages, fitness assessment, peronalized fitness programs. They do provides them if that's what you needs.

There are no initial fees, membership promotions on the radio, the prices are the same year round unless you want to join the 3 months summer membership which is at a discounted rate. All the rates/fees are posted so there are no hidden fees.

Memberships includes:
A comprehensive fitness appraisal and counselling session 
A personalized exercise program 
Supervision by highly knowledgeable fitness professionals 
Aerobic classes townwide 
Use of all Town-owned pools, including Aquafit, lane swim and recreation swim 
Use of Thornhill and Centennial Fitness Centres 

The equipment room is nice and open with big floor to ceiling windows. The equipments are clean and up to date. There is at least 2 fitness trainers supervising and they are more than happy to show you how to use the equipments or the machines.

The changeroom has 4 showers, a sauna, a whirlpool and tons of day lockers for use.

And the use of town wide swimming pools for lane/recreation swim and aquafit classes is a plus! All you need is to flash your membership card and you get in for free!

The only thing is the fitness classes, you do need to enroll online every terms. So I ended up waking up at 6:30 AM to register in order to get in some of the classes! Fitness members are put on waitlist if not enough non members are enrolling then members got a spot. I usually have no problems getting into the classes I want because they are mostly non prime time classes!

The monthly fees are charged every month to my credit card around ($43) and you do need to renewal every year if you do want to continue with your membership.

There are specials for seniors, full time students and financial aids are available with proof of income."

KzIR6xEmW9Lz72kKSVIvMw,tWVlSt-66fl6bk9_5UzltQ,"The Cleveland Food Bank is doing a wonderful job feeding Cleveland's hungry, and unfortunately, the need is abundant. I have volunteered many times here, and have learned that volunteerism at the Food Bank is absolutely essential to help as many people as they can. 

Although it's been a while (over a year) since I've last volunteered, I definitely plan on making volunteering at TFB this year a top volunteer priority once I can put together a group who can go in the evenings. I met many people in the break room before shifts who were volunteering with their companies or churches - a great way to build strong teams!

I have had so much fun at every volunteer shift! Because our group could only get together in the evenings to work, our tasks were not in the community kitchen, but in the warehouse, which I loved!

Sample tasks include sorting boxes of donated nonperishables to get rid of any expired or egregiously damaged boxes then sorting into categories before weighing and packing 20 lb boxes of like items. 

My favorite job was working in the ""meat"" room. Despite getting kind of skeeved out by handling hundreds of pounds of raw frozen meat, I thought the job was really fun - one team member unpacks frozen meat from boxes and sends them down a conveyor belt. Then, other members of your team grab whatever kind of meat each of them are assigned (chicken, beef, processed, etc.) as it comes down the belt, and then they pack up 20 or 25 lb boxes of each like item. This job, in particular, is an AWESOME workout, too!

One time, I was assigned to break down boxes in the BOX COMPACTOR!!! It was pretty much the most exciting thing ever! Love robot-like machines!

The Food Bank staff are so warm and friendly, too!! 

So, to recap, volunteering at the Cleveland Food Bank will give you the warm and fuzzies for being a good person, you directly help impact your community in a positive way, it's a great free workout, you'll make new friends or stronger relationships with your current team - it's a win, win, win!"

DjdVa1HpEZSXWIKx7cq6aw,Uhx_rLgqVTsyM9WhaUCYmw,"I bought a Facial + 50min Massage Groupon ($79) for the Beauty Scene and redeemed my voucher this past weekend. I always read Yelp reviews before buying massage/facial Groupons just to make sure my purchase will be worth it and after reading these reviews, I thought it would be totally worth dishing out the $79 + tip. Well I'm here to tell you it was ok.

Upon arrival, it did seem like it was going to be a super great experience; it is located in a nice plaza up in the Greyhawk area. The lobby was really nice and the staff was friendly. First I had to fill out the standard new client paperwork and then I was greeted by my massage therapist. It was a really relaxing massage, but the pressure was more on the lighter side. (Interesting: I put 'medium pressure' on the paperwork up front, it made me wonder if I should have put hard?) The massages also come with a foot scrub and that was awesome. She did, however, use oil and not lotion during the massage, so afterwards my hair looked like it was wet - something to keep in mind if you are looking to run errands afterwards. 

Next I had my facial. I had to wait in the little hallway for about 2minutes while the person getting a facial before me changed clothes, came out, and then they had to put new sheets on the bed. Kind of awkward but it was fine. The facial was ok, I have definitely had better. They didn't use a Clarisonic and I feel like they don't have as many products as other salons do. (Interesting: on the last step of the facial she said ""and here's some sunscreen"" as she was putting it on my face. It made me wonder back to the paperwork, on the question ""do you usually wear sunscreen?"" I circled yes, but that doesn't mean that I want a layer of that on my face at the end of my facial).

Overall, it was a nice relaxing experience but not my favorite."

M5A5r0HbMRfTzidqMKYHfw,n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,"Believe the hype - it may just be a food truck, but Top Notch Barbeque is a legitimate BBQ game-changer in Vegas, with the potential to do for que what Slider Truck did for burgers. 

The Las Vegas Weekly just recognized them (rightly) as the best BBQ in Vegas, which is a refreshing change of pace in a city that insists on bowing at the overrated altars of flavorless Famous Dave's or jerky-tough Memphis Championship.

The thing to order here is the pulled pork sandwich topped with Cincinnati chili. It's like two of my favorite foods ever made a delicious baby. Served on a crispy toasted bun, the sandwich is a brilliant ""why-didn't-somebody-think-of-it-sooner?"" pairing of rich, smoky (apple and pecan wood, I think?) and impossibly juicy pork shoulder and just a touch of sweet, spicy Cincy chili. Honestly the pork is a little more chopped than pulled, and while I generally prefer the latter, this is perfection. Especially when contrasted with the relatively thin texture of the chili, which is a perfect example of the unique, cinnamon-centric regional favorite. The only other spot in Vegas serving Cincy chili is Egg and I/Egg Works, and to be honest I find their chili to be overly sweet and a little dry in comparison. But this? The real deal.

The only other meat I've had there is their hot link, which is juicy with a nice snap - I wish I had ordered it with the chili. Their potato salad is the only side that I've had, and it's superb. I've heard many good things about their sweet potato casserole and baked beans and definitely look forward to trying them.

Their sauce comes in mild and spicy; as is custom I opted for the hot. Which actually had a fair amount of bite - a rare thing for me to say about anyone's BBQ sauce.

AW7xZy1UkI1yxs4KuEvsqg,JomZyT5aJzKQiG4V2oPzdg,"My car had to go to the auto shop for what was supposed to be the whole weekend.  Needing a car to get around I decided to use Enterprise Rent-A-Car off of Via De Ventura since its close to where I live.  I spoke with Sam who had their driver Ignacio pick me up and take me to the rental location.  Before I go on, I have to say that Sam and Ignacio were very friendly and helpful; definitely represented Enterprise with their customer service.  Anyway, so after getting to Enterprise I worked with the district manager Mike on renting a car for the whole weekend at a great weekend price of $9.99 - which I thought was a steal.  Mike was very polite and although he offered me the insurance for renting the car, which I obviously declined- Mike was not pushy or rude about it.  Unlike my last experience with Enterprise just a week prior at the Dallas Love Fied location.  The Love Field rental agent irritated me with his pushy antics.  So after having the car for a few hours, my mechanic at Whitey's Auto Repair called and said that my car was fixed and that it wouldn't take the whole weekend.  I was obviously excited, but felt embarassed to have rented the car for the whole weekend and now would have to return it early.  I called and spoke to Mike, who was totally understandable and laughed with me on the phone.  He easily took the car back with no issues and even had their cool driver Ignacio drop me off at the mechanic shop.  Overall I was surprised at the dedication and customer service Mike, Sam and Ignacio offer here at the Via De Ventura location.  This will definitely be my first choice for car rental locations in the Scottsdale area."

We don't think much about the standard type institutions we use on a daily basis, we just expect them to magically be there, somehow -- like the banks, schools, government offices and so on.  My experience with Wells Fargo Bank dates back at least 25 years.  I chose the bank because it was close to my location at the time, and was a recognized banking establishment.  Store fronts have changed, internet arrival changed the way we all operated, but through it all, I don't recall a single banking error or service problem that ever occurred.  Wells Fargo was what I needed it to be for me, a place to store and retrieve money when I needed the service.  I never took advantage of all the many other services available, such as loans or credit cards, because I had those services already established.  The credit that is due is that with ATM services, Wells Fargo has been my steadfast partner in all the countries I have been through all these years.  Thanks much !!"

It takes quite a bit for me to get antsy with respect to cleanliness, so this is clearly bad. The fact that I broke out 2 times, due to how unsanitary it was, is the reason why I won't return here.

Before they showed up for the move, they called ahead to confirm the pickup time. Two friendly gentlemen showed up on time and got right to work after confirming the agreed upon prices. These guys did not rest and moved very quickly on what was a scorcher of a summer day. They were professional, friendly, and did a fantastic job both in the pickup and drop off our stuff. They wrapped everything carefully and secured our possessions in the truck so they wouldn't slide around during the drive. 

They also did the whole move in exactly 3 hours, which is the minimum you pay for (common among moving companies). So the quote was exactly what we paid. I was incredibly impressed and would definitely use Max Moving again."

I received a text from Subway with a link to the coupon code, and I clicked it, only to be taken to another screen that said not to click it until I am with a cashier. So, I headed to Subway. 

When I got there, there were two other customers getting ready to leave, and I was immediately greeted by the sandwich artists. It took them no time at all to come and ask for my order. There were three ladies working today. One was making sandwiches, one was running the cash register, and one was refilling the ice in the soda machine. They all seemed very friendly. 

The lady making my sandwich was very polite and did everything perfectly. She gave me a generous amount of veggies as well, which I certainly appreciated. When I got to the register, I explained that I had a strange coupon, and I was given the cashier's undivided attention when I clicked the button to activate my coupon. She explained to me that the reason a cashier needs to be present is because it times out after five minutes, and they need to see the countdown to ensure the coupon is still valid. 

At this point, I know I'm a terrible person, but I've been out of work due to an injury for a while, and I have to save money where I can. I apologized to the cashier as I handed her my payment (in the form of mainly quarters.) She assured me it was no problem at all, and continued to be extremely pleasant.

Terrible uneven outlines on the entire tattoo, you can see in numerous places where he COMPLETELY missed his original outline and you can tell where he tried to fix it because its ugly, bolded and the needle went too deep and I'm now scarred. Not sure if all the artists are of the experience of the one I had, but if they are i feel sorry for any tattoo customers.

They troll Craigslist for leads, then suggest a 10% discount (i.e. after marking up prices with 10%..) and will then promise local delivery.  In every country and venue, that means will call.  Not for VIP tickets: they will charge you $15 and you have the choice between:
#1 Driving down to their office way off the strip, during business hours
#2 A bunch of ridiculous hurdles for factual delivery to your hotel (think copies of credit cards, drivers license, signed releases etc).  All bogus stuff so you pretty much have to default to #1 above.  

Knowing I wasn't going to ""win"" this I just bit the bullet and did #1 by going to their office.  When I confronted them about their practice, they did not argue further but immediately refunded the token $15.  So for that they get 2, instead of 1, stars :)"

They finished the job in a very timely manner and took the time to walk me through all of the repairs following completion. They even took very detailed before and after pictures from rooftop vantage points that I was originally unable to see. Their price for the repairs was extremely reasonable and they even blew off all the leaves on the entire roof at no extra charge. Lastly, we had just planted some new grass in our backyard and Charles and his crew went out of their way to make sure they did not trample over the area while making trips to and from their truck. I would highly recommend their services and will definitely make Your Roofing Company my first call if we have any future roof damages."

As a perspective tenant we contacted Power Properties and set up a viewing time to see the home. After being unable to reach them multiple times with no call back, I resorted to e-mailing. We finally set up an appointment through e-mail and were eager to see the home. I asked if we could come sooner since we know what the Calgary housing market is like and he gave me no reply. We didn't want to miss the opportunity to apply for the home and were even willing to do so without seeing it! 

I e-mailed the office asking for an application to rent the home and they refused to give me one. Today I received a call from the Property Manager rudely saying that our appointment is cancelled as the home has been rented sight-unseen. 

The whole interaction was rude, abrupt and amateur. 

I would never rent from Power Properties now and after doing research about their company policies, I will never use this company to manage a property either. 

I hope this review is helpful for perspective tenants in this market. Here's hoping that the vacancy rate increases so Property Management companies such as this are taken down a peg or two."

She recognized that my concerns were real instead of blowing them off like my previous gynocologist. She will stay and answer my questions for as long as I need. 

I have not had Dr. Juarez as a doctor, but he is always friendly when I see him in the office. That is above and beyond patient care, being that he is friendly even to Jessica's patients."

N5BXapF6AwQHZLLVzwTY8Q,P4z8peS_XFNFKhWcdDuHyw,"Close to home and VERY affordable.  It's definately a ""sufficient"" child care place for those of us on a budget.  They seem to be a little ""behind the times"" technologically but I guess you get what you pay for.  There are plenty of toys and activities to keep your child busy throughout the day and I get a general sense that the teachers love their jobs and care very well for the children.  At least the younger ones.  I'm a little shocked at how much some of the teachers in the older kids classes yell at the kids.  

We are kept informed as to our child's daily activities and they are very accommodating to us on the very few occasions when our daughter has to stay a few minutes beyond the 10 hour day (which has happened 3X in the past year).

My one complaint is the parking lot.  People think they can put their cars anywhere for any amount of time.  I'm surprised more accidents haven't occurred there.  There could be 4 parking spaces open and STILL parents will park in the fire lane or right out in the middle of the lot.  I feel that the business should be more on top of this and letting parents know that the fire lane is for emergencies only and that if there are no parking spaces available (which is RARE), show them where they need to park.  

Overall - it's a great place and I feel like our child is doing very well here."
ggZ3ElY09a8UgkF4WaTUyA,XmfE8sd46Pau0m9NCmvjQg,"B&E Construction has done two major renovations for us including an addition of a wing, transformation of a basement and renovation of 6 bathrooms. Jim, the owner is unfailingly honest and respectful.  He provided expert construction advice and realistic estimates. I never had a change order but he was upfront about additional costs when I selected over-budget materials. He has stood by his work and responded to more than one SOS call with emergencies unrelated to renovations. A leaky fridge water line caused a basement flood when we were out of town and he had it dried up by the time we returned home, years after project work on that area, minimizing damage. Jim's team always produced a beautiful result!"
xDEewEKfLHPbIRV5PQirvg,41aOVl8LWI5koXbqjoGNZA,"My daughter took her Galaxy Note here for a bad charging port.  THe price they quoted was fair, $85

First, they implied they might fix it the same day.  Then they said, probably the next day.  Anyway, long story short, they had the phone for three weeks.  Every time we called, we were told, ""Don't call us, we'll call you when it's ready.""  Considering some of their customers only have one phone, I think they should expect customers to call the check the status.

Turns out they ordered the replacement part from China, which takes two and half weeks.  I repair computers and would never think of keeping a client's device that long unless the situation was clearly and frequently communicated and agreed to by the customer.

After three weeks, we gave up and picked up the broken phone and I explained my concern with their lack of communication. 

I found a store in Las Vegas that had the part needed for $19.  Within 24 hours of picking up the phone from Wireless Toyz, I had repaired it myself.  

I think the techs probably know what they're doing, it's the administration that's to blame.  First, when they take in a phone they should log it into a tracking system (even a spreadsheet would do).  Every day a manager should be reviewing the status of repairs and trying to expedite.  If there's a snag, they should be contacting the customer to let them know the status.

Why in the world a professional phone repair shop can't get parts in the US when I was able to get them in our own town is beyond me.

I can be critical, but at the root, I simply want businesses to improve.  I always give feedback and I try to make it constructive.  When they call me a week from now and say the part is in, I intend to tell them how they should improve their service."

ieE2q3Onr9blYYscePOBZg,fmzIm7RxEdii5Jz44PtO7g,"It is not often that I make a decision based on my first contractor but this one proved to be different. I saw them at the recent Home and Garden show and they took down my information. I called the business while the show was going on and got a callback from the owner Tony the next day.

They came out to my house earlier this week since their original idea was to do cabinet refacing. I sensed that would not work for me since my cabinets when I bought my home were original and made of cheap particle board. When they arrived at my house they totally agreed that a reface would be a waste of good money on poorly crafted boards not to mention the fact that only the wood edges were holding up the shelves. They took measurements and would draw up a plan on how the kitchen would look when finished.

The next step was an appointment at their showroom which I did today for me to  select materials and get a cost quote. They are located near the intersection of Logan Road and Library Road,however, the showroom is by apt only. They have a vast array of wood tones to look at. I thought cherry wood would be dark but I ended up selecting a lovely mid range color and selected a corian countertop to go with it. They showed me the drawings and how they could make use of that ""wasted"" cabinet space located near my stove so I would have two doors opening to a lazy Susan.

They build  all their own woods from scratch since they have a cabinet shop. They laminate, install all the necessary parts including the plumbing and rewiring. At this point I have only signed an agreement with them but I'm sure I will be pleased with the finished product.

They do not accept credit cards, but you can either finance through Dollar Bank or arrange your own. Payment is made in accordance with the terms of the contract signed. The owner Tony explained to me that since their appointments fill up fast so in my case I won't have to wait longer than maybe a month for mine to be installed. Installation will take about a  week.

Although I'm not here to showcase my home I will be grateful to finally have cabinets and countertops that I was told are maintenance free. They guarantee their work for 5 years which sounds like a good warranty."
dukZ5XrXMMu21SnGjPF4_g,fmzIm7RxEdii5Jz44PtO7g,"Move over Tevana. You now have competition. Located in the upper level of Ross Park Mall near American girl this store is very similar to Tevana. They serve you a couple of samples upon arrival. Take you inside for a tour. The sell loose teas, teapots, ice tea pots where you can instantly freeze your homebrewed tea.  They even sell a tumbler where you can mix your tea with wine for a difference taste to it.

The teas we sampled were very good.The prices however are just as expensive as Tevana. The more you buy the more you save. You can even buy teabags where you can put your loose tea to steep them in as well as a Breville teamaker. Many of these items I have seen elsewhere a lot cheaper.

They handed us a brochure so we could see the fall offerings. It doesn't list prices but there are asterisks showing showing you the different pricing levels. In addition they have a rewards program and yes there is an app you can download and link a credit card with it to pay for your tea.What we sampled was quite good but also quite pricey. Keep that in mind should you decide to purchase here. It will be interesting how two major tea chains will survive in this mall."

They agreed to sell me new pedals installed for $30 tax inclusive, after talking them down from $30+tax. After paying, they refused to offer me a receipt. They said I made a _deal_, so I could not get a receipt, or else I would have to pay the tax. 

When I told them I absolutely require a receipt (as it is a tax deduction for me), and that I had already paid so was not re-negotiating the price, an employee came from the back and physically pushed me & tried to remove the bicycle from my hands. 

After I threatened to call the police and Revenue Canada, they begrudgingly provided me with a receipt while telling me ""we never have had a problem with this, you are bringing bad energy in here.""

This store is clearly not paying tax on some of their income. Terrible service, overpriced repairs, tax fraud, and physical harassment. Do yourself a favor, and get your bike fixed anywhere but here! I will be reporting this business to Revenue Canada."
bgIH_UVgvub8D6iNghqMUw,v_u7jfOFpSLxUePDEEtrSw,"It seems socialized medicine is alive and well in the Show Low office of this outfit!

As an Insulin dependent diabetic since 1963, I've seen my fair share of doctors through the years and this office may just be the absolute worst I've ever visited. And in the past 50 years, I've met plenty of professionals who want to take care of you, and plenty more who are just in it for the money.

 I have retinopathy - going blind - and have had my sight saved by a fine Ophthalmologist in Las Vegas, NV. I saw this doctor for 10 years - once per year the last 5 so he could dilate my eyes and check behind them to ensure I wasn't hemorrhaging.

In the past year, I retired on disability and moved to AZ. So I hooked up an appointment with Dr. Jamal for an annual check-up at the closest office to me in Show Low. It seems like from the instance, I was harassed. Of course they want insurance info. I have Medicare & a supplement through my union hall which pays everything Medicare doesn't. I provided all my doctors contact data including fax numbers where Jamal's office could gather my medical records of diagnostic tests, etc., which I've had in the past. 

When I got to the office for my 1PM appointment, I was told I would be there for 2 hours. I asked why and was informed that since I was a new patient, the doctor may do diagnostic tests on me - diagnostic tests which I've already had done and had previously provided them with means to gather from my other doctors. Diagnostic tests which can be very beneficial in the enhancement of profit for a physician's business......eh?

Are ya'll getting' the picture here?  

A friend of mine's mother also sees Dr. Jamal. They've sat for hours in this office and were told it was because of ""surgery."" The doctor who did laser surgery on my eyes completed each procedure in 10 minutes or less and as I previously stated, he saved my sight.

The office in Show Low was packed when I walked in - over-scheduled. By 1:30, I still hadn't been called back and the receptionist was telling patients that the doc was 15 to 20 minutes behind. I got better things to do than sit for more than 3 hours in a doctor's office, taking diagnostic tests I don't need! Furthermore, when I make an appointment, I KEEP IT! And it seems to me that to sit in an overcrowded office where a physician doesn't keep his appointments should be construed as a violation of his oath! 

It looked obvious that this office was purposely over-scheduled! Rake 'em in then make 'em sit and sweeten the pie with all those unnecessary tests.

All I got to truly spend in my life is TIME. To me, my TIME is better spent taking a 400 mile journey back to Vegas to see the professional who saved my sight. He won't run any unnecessary tests on me, nor will make me wait for hours. I've been in and out of his office, with tests and surgery in under 90 minutes! 

Besides, the scenery between here and Las Vegas is truly breathtaking and someday I may never be able to see it again. It beats the hell out of sitting in Dr. Jamal's office for 3 hours!"

It has a modern country feel. Chic but still warm and inviting. The shelves are stocked with a great selection genres. There are also a variety of locally sourced small gift items that make this a wonderful all around shopping experience when looking for cute gifts. 
The owner was pleasant and helpful even though my friends and I had walked in just at closing time. We never felt rushed or unwelcome like in bigger chain stores. 
The prices are reasonable and to be expected. It's not a used shop so everything is in perfect condition. I absolutely recommend this shop to anyone who has a chance to stop it. Definitely worth a visit."

With the latest technology, he is able to get you on a wellness plan that is affordable.  He takes the time to really listen to your concerns then gives you great feedback on your problem areas.  

My husband has been suffering with neck and back pain for years and he is finally getting the proper care to ""stop"" his degenerative neck damage.  As for myself, he took my foot impressions and within a week I had my custom made orthotics that have taken the pain away in my hips.  Even more, my daughter was completely comfortable in his care and made her concerns quickly disappear.  With a little change in the way she is carrying herself, she can straighten out what could potentially lead to significant problems later in life.  

What I appreciate most about his business is the unparalleled customer service, deep passion for what he does, and keen understanding for neck, back and foot problems."

I needed a new transmission and the place I was referred to quoted me between $1800-$2500, so I called Urban and they quoted me $800-$1000. Needless to say this was a much better price so naturally I went with them. I got my car back within a matter of days and all was well with the world, then I noticed a small transmission fluid leak. I was upset as I had just spent a good amount of money and to my chagrin the job was not finished, but things happen and nobody's perfect. I called them back and they wasted no time fixing the problem, even gave me a lift back home after I dropped the car back off. All in all it was a good experience, they got the job done cheap and fast and if/when a problem with their work arose the took measures to correct the mistake very professionally and expediently. I would definitely suggest using them if you are in need of vehicle repairs."

I stopped in to have my glasses adjusted last night.
The girl was nice when I walked in, I let her know I just needed my glasses adjusted since my dogs had bumped them and they were now fitting funny.
She looked at my glasses and said in a rude tone "" We don't sell this brand here, I can adjust them but it is on you"" ( I have went there to have my glassed fixed previously with no problem)
Then she walks behind the other counter (about 5-7 feet from where I am standing) as she is working on my glasses, I see her making fun of my arms to her co-workers. (I am a size LX and yes I was wearing a sleeveless shirt since it was warm out) I guess that she thought I could not see at all without my glasses on .
Then after fixing my glasses she brings them back to me and the nose piece is still a bit off and the piece behind my ear. So she goes behind the other counter again and goes to fix them while rolling her eyes and making a face, like I am annoying her. (Again, I was only about 5-7 feet from her)
She brings them back to me again and now the glasses are so loose they are falling off of my face. I finally had to ask if there was a Lenscrafters in the Mall which they pointed me in that direction. I ended up going to Lenscrafters to have my glasses fixed correctly and with better service.

My friend and I returned the other day to get our Crybaby applied. This is a temporary mascara that lasts for 2-3 weeks. According to The Beauty Scene it is a local product and I love to support local!

The treatment itself was nice. They lay you in on a vibrating pod bed which is pretty relaxing. 

The Crybaby itself is ok. I probably wouldn't do it again at full price but it was fun to try. It's nice to cut a step out of your beauty routine each day. Most people will still touch up with regular mascara though. I have been since a couple spots were missed on the application. 

I really appreciated the complimentary eyebrow wax that Janel gave me but I was really shocked she didn't ask my permission first.... What if I didn't want them waxed or if I was growing them out? It would have been too late because it was already on my face. 

My overall impression was everyone there was very friendly and helpful. The service was enjoyable even though I don't think the product is for me. The bonus wax was super nice but hopefully they ask before wax is on the skin next time, just in case."

Food -- very cheap compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to.  Plain naan was good although we preferred the Garlic better but pretty small though.  Chicken Tikka Masala was not as creamy as I've had at other Indian restaurants.  Beef curry was ok.  But for what we paid (about $7 per person), can't complain.

The office staff is always happy to help and information is available in the form of pamphlets and flyers.  The gate program is excellent as well and the 5th grade Pali trip really made my daughter's year.  If I had one criticism, however, it is the lack of use of technology.  Although they have computers available, they seem to only use them for testing.  Also, the website is seriously lacking in updates especially teacher websites.  I understand they are moving to a new webhost so I am anxiously awaiting everyone being up and running on the internet.

I could not have been happier, as I've been dealing with low/mid back pain for years and was interested in trying dry-needle therapy. Betsy and Mike are absolute godsends when it comes to the needles and manipulations. They definitely know the human body and the musculoskeletal structure, and gave me great stretches and strengthening exercises to improve the problem areas that they identified in their assessments. Monica is an incredible massage therapist with the happiest, energetic, friendly personality I've seen in a long time!

Location is clean, very accessible right of 215, close to home and work, and the equipment is all in excellent condition a they run a great ship there. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is purely and only because the hours are not as convenient as would be helpful to those that work during the week. I can't go during my typical lunch breaks because they're closed down for lunch, and because I get off at 4:30pm, I can't make it there for an hour session because their last one is at 4 for a 5pm closing time. If they catered their hours to better accommodate their working clientele, this place would be 5-stars, easily."
Yf1Op02UNSKeXx5Fu15DAg,EJ7ZhRHsMWj8du77LX34gw,"Gawd. Who are these people buying cold beer in the morning? I mean. Really? Seriously. It's not even 10 am on a Saturday and you're standing in line with *two* six packs. I noticed the careful deliberation you took in the back of the store evaluating the many choices. It's beer for goodness sake. Just buy something.

What is going on? Degenerate.

...I'm sure that's what everyone else was thinking looking at me. Yes, me. With a pair of crutches and two six packs. I needed beer that much.

Just as a side note, before I justify buying beer that early, why is beer in the back of the store anyway? It's an important purchase people beeline to the back to make. You're either in the store paying for gas with cash (well, not at 7-11, but if you are, I hate you), buying lotto, mainlining coffee or in a desperate search for a personal item. Beer should be closer to the door.

Just a thought. Call me crazy.

Anyway, I popped in this weekend to pickup beer to prepare for what turned into an epic night of drinking at a housewarming party. I was disappointed to learn hard booze was not available. (So my planned gift was dashed. Thank goodness for the magic of online gift giving.) 

I was so happy to wait mere seconds in line. I wish I had my receipt. The lad who checked me out (No, not *that* way. I'm too old for that.) was a joy. There were two people on an existing line so he opened another register. This was not a long drawn out process I had feared. My good friend Jolly had graciously stopped her day of Sherp'ing me around to buy beer. Short line = great!

Mr Cashier was not robotic. I felt like I was chatting with a neighbor. ""Hey, how are you guys? Good morning so far?"" and so on. Which honestly, how many times can you say with sincerity and a smile? This guy has it going on. Sweet!

I grew up with 7-Eleven on Long Island. I'll have to make a practice of stopping in here more often. Such a wonderful, pleasant experience. Not sure what else they stock as I was very focused on BUYING BEER.

Nice people!"

iLIWfrUFjP4EoyHPr06QNQ,NgBYSAf3BQUX0Mwj0Y_vjQ,"Came in for an eye exam, new contacts, and glasses. 

First and foremost, be prepared for a hefty bill. This isn't a place to come if you want a cheap eye exam and $100 frames and lenses. 

Because the optometrist had a separate office the set up it is a little weird and awkward but there isn't a lot of foot traffic from walk ins and they seem to have a perfect scheduling system since seating is limited. 

First I met with Ashley(?); she was a super nice woman who helped me find a new pair of glasses. I haven't had new glasses in about 5 years and I never wear them out so she was so patient with having me find a pair I felt comfortable in to actually wear in public from time to time. Then I had my exam and was headed out. I only spent about 45 minutes max there. 

Like I said earlier, be prepared to spend some $$$ and be aware of deals they have going on. My eye exam from the optometrist was $170 (which is charged separately from the Target Optical area). I settled on Coach glasses that were $200 for the frame and got a year supply of contacts for about $125 and got a $15 Target Gift Card on the way out. Left feeling so much lighter after spending about $450 on the glasses and contacts in top of the cost of the exam.

Will definitely recommend. Great staff, great location, and convenient."
-lbSMzyJ9vonB4I0ltlFsg,NgBYSAf3BQUX0Mwj0Y_vjQ,"The best dentist I've ever had!

I truly wish I had a dentist like Dr. Stewart or else my teeth wouldn't have been in such bad shape. 

The office is located in a convenient shopping center with Target, Old Navy, Sally's, etc. Parking is plentiful. 

Office staff and hygienists are very nice and welcoming. Whenever I've had an issue, it had been quickly resolved. They accept my insurance and I've had to pay some out of pocket fees but their office has been great with communicating with me. 

Dr. Stewart was able to void my diagnosis of having gum disease but told me I had cavities. 8 of them! It's been months later since filling them and I've had no issues. He even prescribed me with a toothpaste to help with other oral issues I've been having. He is very sarcastic and funny.

This is definitely a great place to come. Between cleaning and getting cavities filled, I have no complaints. Billing is also easy and convenient."
OBJ3xDMpvjn1tv_0SmBNOQ,_MjgqPR1pvDnZZ6wCwabBQ,"I am very, VERY disappointed in my recent visit to Emidio's banquet center.    My husband and I were invited to a wedding and the reception was held here last night.

Having lived in the valley for years I have had the experience of Edidio's restaurant and was hoping for the same quality back then, here at their banquet center.  I had greatly misjudged this.  I wish I could give ""NO STARS"" or ""NEGATIVE"" stars, but alas, 1 star will have to do.

Here's why:
The place is very clean and neat.  Even the bathrooms were good.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  The decor is lacking in modern times, but still decent and gave people something to talk about.  All of that is good. Why a negative if possible you might be asking yourself.  The food.  The food was HORRIBLE!!!!!!

DON'T EAT THE FOOD!!!!

It was a buffet and it was the worst food I have ever had at a reception.  EVER!  And I have been to a ton of receptions.  THIS WAS THE WORST!!!
The menu looked basic enough.  Salad delivered to the tables, steamed vegetables, rigatoni with plain sauce, mashed potatoes, chicken breast (baked, i think?) and some kind of beef gravy.

All of the food was NOT HOT.  Luke warm at best.  My rigatoni was COLD.  ICE COLD.  No joke.  I took one bite, and discreetly tried my very best to swallow since we didn't have paper napkins.  The chicken was so dry, i could have used it as a hockey puck.  Seriously.  Boxed mashed potatoes were ok, but the gravy?  ummmmm.... NO THANK YOU.  The steamed vegetables lacked so much in flavor, even I who doesn't like salt, asked for salt and butter and some life for those poor vegi's!!!  I couldn't find my salad under all that dressing.  I didn't even bother trying the rolls, or the wedding cake.  NO THANK YOU.  If you chose this to serve your guests, I don't even want to think about what the rolls and cake would taste like.  OH... tap water to drink.  Yeah..... 

REJECTING ALL INVITATIONS THAT HAVE EMIDIO'S AS A RECEPTION.  NEVER!!!!! NEVER!!!!! NEVER!!!!! COMING BACK!!!"

The peruvian owners have managed to get their hands on some goodies though. If you're looking for Inca Kola, look no further. Ditto Blue Mountain coffee from Jamaica. I was merely there for fresh peanut butter, and to be honest, I've had better. But I'd return to see what else they have in store. Whoa, got a little ahead of myself with that pun.

The decor is inspiring if you have a hard on for the 44th president. There is Obama memorabilia everywhere, mementos of his inauguration, and his face graces every table top. Really. The walls are slathered in a coffee bean wallpaper which gives a dark and unsettling aura; like you've fallen into a silo of single-origin beans. Seating is kind of sparse. There are are two booths, a few bistro tables and a lot of empty space.  

Now granted, they barely serve anything here. Their coffee is all Kenyan (natch) but I'm far too much of a coffee snob to trust a cup from here. I attempted to get a Diet Soda but cold cans were in short supply. I eventually settled on a lukewarm Ginger Ale. If that isn't a metaphor for Obama's presidency, I don't know what is.

In short, I can't really comment on their food and drink but as Obama-themed cafГ©s in Toronto go, it wasn't half bad.

Obligatory Title Pun: KENYA dig it?

Menu Readability: It's just a sign above the counter.

Need to mention: They have a TV that I assumed is perpetually tuned to Kenyan soccer.

I doubt I would've. It's been a long time! And that ""usual"" was still quite satisfactory. And the drive-through employee was so nice, and my onion rings so fresh...that I even awarded them the extra star as a thank-you and ""welcome to the neighborhood!"" 

Now there are the three biggies up this way: Mc'Ds and In-n-Out off the Carefree Hwy/I-17 exit and this BK off the fairly new Dove Valley exit. If you want to deal with a little less traffic/lines...BK is the way to go (for now.) (and yes, there's a BK down Carefree Hwy east, a couple miles.)

If I could rate it zero star for this one, I would. I had the most horrible nail experience here. The one who did my nails was a guy, the owner's brother. He is so rude, full of attitude and obnoxious. On a side note, they hate walk-ins. They way they treated the customers that they know is completely different than a walkin. Considering they are a hole in the wall nail salon, they are really digging their own grave. Now onto the guy who did my nails. When I was asking the colours, he told me he only does 2 brands, and the other girls do the other brand nail polishes. Like what does it even mean? The owner started auguring with me that the nails I have on are shellac, just because they look like shellac. I Freaking know my own nails! So then the guy started taking off my nails, and he said you do have gel nails on and I need to take the overlay off of your nails so I will charge you. What a ridiculous place! Arguing with me abt my own nails only to find out they are wrong. Not to mention they are so defensive abt answering my simple questions. I asked what colour is popular here because I was indecisive, he gave me so much attitude, and told me honestly everybody is different I can't give u an answer. It's the way he said it! It was so rude and disrespectful! When he started doing my nails, he lectured me abt not going on my phone, because it will chip easily later if I use my phone during his work. At this point I was already done with it. At one point I asked him if they do waxing here, he started lashing out and said we don't have time for you today, and I don't do waxing, only the girls do it. For God's sake! It's just a simple question! What is wrong with him! Not to mention it was only 5:30pm and they close at 7:30! I just can't understand this place! They like to fight! I left with no tips but feeling angry and upset. I will NEVER EVER recommend, or come back to this place. I really in fact hope they can go out of business, and the owner should really get her brother some help, like anger management. I hated this place and would not go back. Be smart, stay away from here."

However, I do recommend that you call in ahead of time and order, in that case you won't have to wait. The wings and chilli onion fries were amazing!! Never a let down. One thing I do suggest would be to double check the bill, because they do have daily specials. 

Definitely recommend this place for take-out, especially for the wings and chilli onion fries.

Quaint, cheap furnishings with the ballgame on tv and Keno being played. I thought maybe they had Super Nintendo while you wait for food, but it was the Ohio lottery's latest family destroyer that was flickering and threatening to give patrons seizures.

Anyhow, the food: I had the perch dinner with cole slaw and fries. They offered more classy fair like crab stuffed tilapia or lemon pepper roughie. But i'm a novice fish eater and like to keep it simple. Fish was flaky, but breading was bland. Slaw was okay and fries were thickly cut. My wife had the veggie burger and onion rings(we're not Three Birds anniversary kind of people, we're poor). The spinach dip appetizer was tasty, but runny. Service was attentive(place was pretty empty) and pleasant. All in all, a visit to Long John's and BK with a stop at a bar would have been more fun and less money. Live and learn. 

I'm just in a bad mood. It has been raining all October. This is the time of year i hike through crunchy leaves, not trudge through wet compost. I got spoiled with a cool summer and laughing at angry summer people who felt their favorite time of year sucked. Karma is a soggy, wet kick in the buckeyes."
DIkgSjte8Y6JPdOreKrDxQ,i8hCMZN-0bHENsHZKHpC-g,"I haven't found anything cool in a TJ Maxx since I was 20. Not kitschy enough to rival resale shops, not higher end enough to rival the mall or even Target. But this is now a Homegoods Maxx. I'm not sure how the rebranding makes a difference, but I finally bought something here so I must be on the rebranding bus. They do have some designer purses that I never noticed in previous years(for instant wife happy). Though I never really looked before. I only started doing that since becoming a Nordstromholic. I was not really in the market for anything in particular. was kind of just comparison shopping cutting boards with World Market. Then I saw it. 

A giant three foot high silver plated statue of the Hindu deity Ganesh. I have several smaller Ganesh items in my home already. This one is like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Housewares size. THIRTY BUCKS! Steal. Also found a twenty dollar white classical bust of a girl. Matches my other white bust in my Tuscan backyard. Cutting boards, eh who cares. So fifty dollars damage. Not bad for some pretty unique items. I like getting sculptural things. Candle holders, frames, rugs I have enough of. But weird big sculptures really make a room.

So I go to ring out and the clerk is an older Indian lady. Here we go, I thought. She smiled, recognized said deity, then gave me a suspicious look. ""You know about Ganesh?"" 
I said I was familiar.
 ""We worship him"". 
Uh huh.
 ""So is this just for decoration or...""
 I said that I already had a few other ones and that it was more than decoration. Without saying it was for religious purposes(which I myself am not even sure if it is or not), I let her know that I was ""spiritual"" and not just some dumbass who likes elephant gods wielding hatchets. Though maybe that's all it is. Who knows. She was satisfied with my pseudo George Harrison act and wished me a good night. It was pretty cute."
C1gS-Ka4zr_f1x6ybne5TA,ppATz6PAs8pGi4VcfIrUSw,"Here is an extremely nice salon located in a tiny strip mall just off Elbow Drive in the SW.  The interior of the place is so nice and fashionably decorated you would think that it's a fancy, up-scale salon.

Well, you would be wrong.  This place actually has some of the best prices in the city, which would explain why it's busy.  They do take walk-ins, but I recommend making an appointment since you could be waiting a while for a stylist to free up.

All the hairdressers there are extremely stylish and look like they know what they're doing.  Each one has her own funky style, which really comes across in the way they cut hair.  It's always nice to have your hair in the hands of a person who looks good.  I'd have it no other way.

I think their name is catchy, the place is immaculate, and the stylists are great at what they do.  Those things all combined makes The Worx a terrific place to get your hair done!"

I called 311 n was transferred to the animal control voice mail because it was Friday after 4:30. Two hours later, no one had returned the call. The dogs were still barking and seemed to have claimed the backyard. I called 311 again and requested for animal control to b paged. The children were scared. I was informed that animal control does not come out unless someone is being attacked. How is someone supposed to call, be placed on hold, while being bit?"

     With a padded leather ceiling La Scarpa at the Bellagio is tucked away on the way to the pool and the Gallery of Fine Art side, just pass the main guest elevator, to the right. 

      It's a small boutique, odd display, and rarely busy. It carries a wide range of American and European designers such as Christian Dior, Cocobelle, Cole Haan, D&G, DVF, Kors, L.A.M.B, Michael Kors, Beverly Feldma, Stuart Weitzman, Twelfth Street and Via Spiga. There's nothing understated about this boutique. 

     I've been here a few times that they don't have my size, but this time I got lucky. I got myself a pairs of Beverly Feldman and mom a pairs of MK shoes!

E3CmhL4pNaSfPdwWIFC78w,YxHnAqL_eJsKrqMvM20LfA,"I recently went to this location to get a new eye exam and some sunglasses. I also brought a recently purchased frame that I liked with an old prescription and simply wanted to replace the lenses. The eye exam went good and now it was time to pick out some sunglasses. When I first met with the associate who helps with the picking out of your frames( a tall blonde haired woman ) we started picking out new frames. I asked her if my old frames I brought in cold be used instead and she checked them then said yes. I stopped looking at regular frames and went on to pick out my sunglasses. The sales associate told me about this ""great promotion"" that was going on where you bought one pair of frames and received the second pair and half off. This deal really didn't work for me since I was providing my old frames but she kept pushing that it was such a great deal I should take advantage of it. After about the fourth time of mentioning it i said ok but never picked out my frames because I assumed my older frames were going to count as my first pair. I have double coverage insurance between myself and my wife ( who works for a hospital so her insurance plan has amazing coverage) so I have never paid more than 100.00 for my new frames. My bill came to almost 400.00 and I was confused but figured it was the cost of the special treatment for my lenses and the high end sunglasses frames I picked out. When I went to pick up my glasses I was handed the sunglasses I remembered picking out but then was handed a pair of regular frames I don't remember picking out because I was expecting new lenses in the frames I left with the associate. I told them these were not my frames and was told they would check into it. I got a call from the associate who helped me and she actually tried to convince me that I took my frames home and must be confused. I know I did not but also knew that arguing this point was moot. Knowing that I was basically talked in circles into taking this promotion for the frames is what bothers me the most. I went in for one thing and ended up with something I really didn't have to pay for at that time. And on top of it all my old frames were gone. I don't expect anything from this because I did get new glasses and sunglasses but I didn't have to pay out of pocket close to 400.00 if the associate would have just honored my request for new lenses in MY frames. My fault for being talked into it but it was like a pressure sale and thats what my problem is."

The studio is clean, and the room has a great filtered air system that doesn't make you feel like you're breathing your own sweat during a hot yoga class (even though you kinda are...) I took a hot yoga class at around 6ish in the evening and I have to say I wouldn't come here if you are a beginner. The evening class was full of well trained hot yogis. The class is taught in the ""flow"" style similar to Sumit's Yoga (for those who are familiar with Sumit) and the teacher/part owner, Jenni was a ""no fluff"" instructor (which I love) and was not overly repetitive or pushy. At the end, in shavasana all the students were treated to a temple masssage with what I want to say was clover oil?

Then in a misguided efffort to make it Hip, it was switched to Maz. Not sure how old it is but I do know it was open when the boys came back from WW2 and it did well serving steaks and featured live music. On my last visit home I took a friend from St. Louis with me and I described it to him as a Dive Bar. He then corrected me to say it wasn't a Dive Bar but rather a 'Joint', I believe he was right.

This place gets 5 stars because it is a landmark and should be preserved so I can go back for a few beers every couple of years.

IlMfUXp2ajAjKED11R5XPg,qb-18g5ha4mJkyrL-8jjeA,"I grabbed a slice of pizza at this Pizza Cottage location about a month ago an really enjoyed the pizza so I decided to order it again for delivery.  I called and ordered and about 30 minutes later they called back and asked where I lived because the delivery driver was having problems finding it on the GPS.  I had no problem giving them the directions to my house because GPSs have been known to be wrong for my address.  The directions were pretty simple and I didn't think I would hear from them after that.

Approximately 20 minutes after the first call, I received a call from the driver asking me where to go so I directed him and stayed on the phone until he said he was outside of my condo building.  I expected the buzzer for the front door to go off shortly after that but after 10 minutes my phone rang again and it was the delivery driver wondering what building in the complex I was in.  Any delivery driver should know that if your apartment number is 5607 then its building 5000, floor 6, apartment 5607 but apparently he didn't so I directed him to the correct building.  I then waited for the buzzer again which didn't come because he called me again saying that he was outside of my building.  I told him to ring my buzzer and I would let him in.  I waited another 5 minutes and then the buzzer rang.  I went in the hall and waited since I have a dog and didn't want him to knock on the door.  I'm not sure where he went after the buzzer but I waited 10 minutes for him to find my apartment.  

I asked when he left the restaurant and he said about 40 minutes ago which meant my pizza was cold so I mentioned this to him and he said nothing.  The restaurant is about 7-10 minutes from my house so its a little ridiculous that it took this long.  I paid him and brought my pizza inside to find it to be cold and not even close to the quality that I ate when I ate in store.  I would also like to mention that they have a policy that they won't deliver for under $25 before the $5 delivery fee.  I think the policy is okay but the delivery charge is a little high.  My order was about $15 and the person who I spoke with on the phone to order said they would do it anyway but what they did was just charge me $25.  Overall I was dissatisfied with  the service and the food."
GjPPxglvph5tCwdeYbjd_A,RylA6VZUTRuMGBu4nHKbCw,"I was highly impressed with Lens Crafters. I didn't have my eye exam here, but my glasses purchase was a great success. 

As soon as I walked in a friendly optician met me and asked what I needed. She briefly looked at my prescription, determined they could help me, directed me to the correct section of the store and gave me a tray to collect the glasses I liked in. 

She then allowed me to browse alone, checking on me once during that time. There was a good selection of name brand frames and styles.  

When I had chosen three frames I liked the optician took my photograph in each pair and provided me a quarter screen side by side view. This technology was very helpful in choosing a pair. It helped draw attention to things like where my eye was positioned in the lens. The optician offered good advice regarding which frame would work best with my prescription. 

They offered a $34 insurance that covers the frames for 1 year - replacement with $25 deductible.  

For payment Lens Crafters accepted my Medical Mutual insurance. They also compared my insurance price with the price of their current sale. My insurance won, but by fewer than $100. 

The glasses on the shelf are the actual ones you take home. Aside from brands like Ray Ban, the store only stocks one of each frame. The lenses for my frames were ready in less than one hour as promised. The optician was highly skilled in properly adjusting my glasses."

ng55k_dntCjcKiQYmS4YpQ,jH_O6do939jDP2M-ED7GxQ,"Through on-line research, I discovered this gem of a place to hopefully repair a zipper on my favourite jacket.   The material was  deeply stuck in a side pocket zipper.  I took it to two cleaners/alterations shops whereby they tried to remove the material by hand with no success.   I searched again for specifically tailor/alteration shops and one stood out with five star reviews, Stychin Tyme.  I phoned and spoke to the owner, Penny who was so friendly and easy to talk with.  Hence a great first impression.  She felt optimistic saying ""where there is a will, there is a way"".  She said to bring it in when I can.    I decided to drive down a bit later in the day forgetting the exact address and store name.  When I finally found it, the store was closed but lights were still on and staff still in store.  I lightly tapped on window asking for Penny and they let me come in.  Penny and staff were so friendly, not showing any sign of being bothered.  Again I was so impressed - a smile goes a long way.  It makes such a difference when staff you are dealing with are so genuinely pleasant and happy to serve you.  This shop is amazingly unique and quaint.  It was a feast for my eyes - clean and immaculate, neat and tidy.  A HUGE plus as it reflects their professionalism.  Honestly this store is like a piece of art.  Anyway, they offered me a seat while Penny patiently worked by hand to remove the material within zipper.  It was less than ten minutes and VOILA she DID IT!!  I was ecstatic.  As well, she noticed a little tear where material was removed and she immediately sewed it up.  I was in awe, such amazing customer service.  And Penny wouldn't take any money from me.  Well I told them that I would be coming there some day soon with a wonderful treat for all.  

I left there with a BIG SMILE.  This jacket was special to me and Penny had the perseverance to succeed in fixing it.   She certainly went ""the extra mile""!

Customer service today is more important than ever, because it is often the only advantage a company has over its competitors. Whether we are in a recession or a healthy economy, customers have many more choices. A person working in customer service represents his or her Company and can often be the deciding factor in whether or not a customer will return to an establishment.  Penny and staff meet these expectations to the fullest.  They exceeded that by providing the ""WOW"" factor. Keep up the great work!

I highly recommend Stychin Tyme to anyone who needs sewing and alterations."

I informed him on BOTH days that we were only available on Tuesdays as we live in Edmonton but our condo is in Airdrie.  We were booked for the 13th @ 9 am.  Then on the 12th I got a message from Anthony saying that they had moved our appointment to Wednesday the 14th.  Again I made it clear we were ONLY available for Tuesdays.  The new date was February 20th @ 9am.  My husband left Edmonton @ 5am to ensure he was in the condo for 9, shortly before 9 the tech Jason called my husband to ask him if he could move the appointment to the last call of the day b/c he lived in Airdrie and he didn't want to make his day longer.  Excuse me??????  Again we don't live in Airdrie and we could ensure we were there on time.  Jason arrived closer to 10 am.  He refused to run a diagnostic on my boiler he insisted it was malfunctioning.  How do you know that when you haven't actually done anything?  He said we would need to have a cleaning BEFORE he could even try to run a check on it and it would cost $2000.00.  He suggested that we just replace the unit b/c we could pay $2000 and just find out it needs replacing anyway which would cost $10 000.00.  He advised my husband they had no units in stock and would get back to him.  Magically later that day he had 2 units available and suggested we jump on it. Ummmm no!  On the 22nd I got a call from Becky asking for my email address so she could send me the invoice for Jason gracing us with his presence.  I got the email with the bill but no quote. I responded asking for the quote which I was give $9500.00 not including taxes and no break down of labour vs material.  Uhhhh WTF?! So I asked for a break down and was provided it on the 23rd.  Since Tuesday I have spoken to 2 other plumbers/gas-fitters and have been informed that regardless if the boiler was indeed malfunctioning they can still preform the Combustion Performance Analysis.  It's like the computer the hook up to your car to tell you whats wrong.  So again not sure how Jason could say that my boiler needs replacing when he didn't try to do anything.  It's like a doctor saying ah you need a kidney transplant 'cause I got a feeling.  I would suggest you don't use this company and if you do ensure you get a 2nd opinion or 3rd like I did."

 If I could give Public Storage zero stars, then I would. I moved out of my apartment & I was in need of a storage unit. I saw an add for Public Storage, that promised ""first month free"". I didn't get my first month for free after all the hidden fees but I didn't really care about that. Over the months, I would occasionally go there to check on my unit. Everything seemed okay until I was ready to move my belongings out.

 I hadn't checked on my storage unit in the last 2-3 months due to the severe weather. I called Andy around the 1st of February to see if I had a specific timeframe to notify her of my intent to move., She said no & and as long as I gave them a few days before hand, I would be alright. 

So it's 2/7/14 & Andy wasn't in the office. I wanted to pay my last bill. The man charged me $130+ for February. I was charged a $30 late fee that was added to my acct. on 2/6/14 & they didn't even prorate the last month. No one, not even ""nice, sweet Andy"" advised me that I only had the first few days of the month in order to qualify for a prorated amount.....WHATEVER! Lesson learned,. I could deal with that. I didn't like it, but I could deal with it. What I can't deal with is what came next: 

It's 2/8/14 & I'm at the storage facility with my Uhaul truck. I open my storage & proceed to gather my belongings out when I spotted what appeared to be little black dots all over my things. I pulled a storage bin out of the unit & my brother told me it was mice poop. I pulled another one out & it was even more. Mice had come into my unit & pooped & urinated all over my couch, my loveseat, my mattress & box springs, my tables, my clothes, my family pictures & irreplaceable memorabilia. Everything I valued. I had to spend hours sifting thru everything before I could even put it on the truck. I had to throw away so many items that I cared about. Items that I valued so much that I paid a damn storage fee every month for. I was distraught. So not only did I have to get rid of my valuables, I also have the added expense of paying for a new mattress & paying for someone to come & steam clean my couches. (New couches that I was still paying for while in storage) Not to mention, I am hoping & praying that the mice from the storage unit didn't hid in my furniture. I do not want to bring them into my new home....yuck!

 The whole time I was out there on Sat., I never saw anyone in the office. I cleared my unit out & my brother found a dead mouse in the corner of the unit. I called the office on Monday to make them aware of what happened & I didn't get ""nice, sweet, ""I want your business"" Andy""....I got cold-hearted bitch Andy. She advised me that it was out of their hands since I already moved my stuff out. She was defensive & lacked empathy. She just kept saying ""its out of our hands now"". I couldn't believe it. Not a ""sorry"", a ""damn"" or anything! These people are dirty & they don't care about you or your precious items.

Instead we are stuck here for another 9 months paying way too much in rent and living next to someone who constantly parks 2-3 cars on the curb.  

The trash situation is ridiculous, the compactor broken for over a month.  

Utilities are unpredictable, one month 30$and then 77$ the next month with no good explanation.

Top it off with the rent being so high there is no way to save money to move out!

They have lots of good looking cabinets, flooring options, kitchen tops, and doors.  We use them mainly for the cabinetry.  They have several difference option on the stains and designs.  

They mainly deal with contractors and condo renovators, so they do not delivery.  It is pick up for yourself only.  But there is a UHAUL rental right down the road, which rents trucks for about 25-30 a day. 

Bottom line, you can get good quality cabinets cheaper than pretty much anywhere else around town, but it more of a do-it yourself-er place."

pHQHFMBOPFtJwSEPrgvpYQ,EXKDLuYoZUKUNNNYA7TlGQ,"Filiberto's is my favorite Mexican food chain in the valley. This newly opened store lives up to the Filiberto's name. I get the breakfast burrito often. This consists of scrambled egg, peppers, onions, cheese and your choice of ham, sausage, bacon, or chorizo. All this wrapped in an enormous flour tortilla served steaming hot. I mean you can't pick it up with your bare hands hot. The condiment bar offers red and green sauce. not too spicy with a good flavor. The sauces compliment the food very well. 
There are a lot of copycats around the valley. I've never been to any of those other ""Berto"" restaurants because I'm completely satisfied with Filiberto's price and quality."

We were looking for candid moments captured and key moments documented. We were pleased that Yang was there to coordinate the entire day's filming with his second shooter, Chester. Yang was there to meet us for the first time and show us some of the company's work. We know that all members of the team were very professional and had the same shooting style. The editing for all their sample videos were consistent and it was exactly what we were looking for. Our highlight video and raw videos were ready a month and a half later. The highlight video was beautifully edited. It is amazing how they can find the best clips out of the entire day's recordings and manage to put it together in such a short clip. They were very professional, on time, and always tried to get the best footage (even if it means staying out in the heat and lugging around such heavy equipment to do so). Overall, this video will be kept and treasured for a lifetime. No one should miss out on the opportunity to get their wedding moments captured in film as well as photos."

FEJCvvvTmrHxW4r4bKSy4A,WcbuKvHhzv2edo9m_eK3hw,"Warning!  Travelex Currency says, ""No Fees"" but they discount the currency more than 20%.  Example: When traveling to Canada, the exchange rate was near 1.1 meaning we should receive $1,100 per $1,000 we exchange (minus fees).  In reality, Travelex gave us .9, giving us only $900 for each $1,000 exchanged.  If this was an attempt to launder money, I would understand the high mark up.  But of course it wasn't and making $200 on every $1000 exchanged is a racket.  They don't tell you this upfront so know your conversion exchange rate, be ready to pay a fair exchange fee but I'd recommend against Travelex."

CA7T52Hr2D9MDrrTba8J5A,k3zBiXtd0rv8n74VYNdUZw,"I've never been here, but my parents get takeout here occasionally (there are no sit-down facilities, as far as I'm aware - they're just a catering joint). My parents also had a bunch of people over once & placed a large order in advance from Natalie's Kitchen, & the guests really enjoyed it. The kitchen is in a church basement & I think they're only open Tuesdays & Thursdays for people to drop in & pick out their food (although I'm not sure if they operate their catering business using the same hours/days).

We're a family of Ukis & this place does Uki food. It's been ages since I've had food done by Toronto's King of Uki Caterers (Baby Point Lounge), so my only real basis of comparison is Baba's food. Now, Baba's food is good. Certain things, only Baba can do. But the people in Natalie's Kitchen come pretty close.

Their platsky (potato pancakes) are my definite favourite. More like latkes, really - the size of a 45 record & fried a lovely golden brown. Sometimes they can be a little too greasy, though, but their flavour is very nice.

Varynikis (Uki perogies, but boiled rather than fried) are a million times better than something you'd get in the frozen section of a supermarket but still pretty bland. Both the ""cheddar"" & ""sauerkraut"" varieties are nothing to write home about, but by no means bad. They're more flavourful when fried up with some onions (becoming perogies), but they could stand for some more seasoning.

Holubsi (cabbage rolls) are very nice, in my opinion. They used the standard flavourless tomato sauce as a topping, but the rice is nicely cooked & blends well with the meat they use.

Cutlets (both chicken & pork) are standard fare. Again, could do with a little more pepper to give them some extra oomph, but hey, I've never complained while eating them.

Patychki (breaded chicken or pork on a stick) are much juicier than I'm used to (not a bad thing), but my parents love them. They have a nice garlicky flavour (the patychki, not my parents).

Borscht (beet soup) is VERY beet-y. Russian-style borscht, which contains many delicious frills & spices, is more common fare in restaurants. Natalie's Kitchen's borscht is much simpler (as per Uki doctrine), but very light & refreshing as well. A nice change from the heavier-tasting borschtes to which I've grown accustomed.

All in all, this place is recommended if you're driving by (or live nearby) & don't feel like cooking. You won't be blown away, but you won't be disappointed, either. Uki food is tough to critique for me, partially because I grew up eating it but also because it's no-nonsense food. It can be bland, but this blandness doesn't allow any room for error - mistakes are very easy to taste in Uki food! To this end, Natalie's Kitchen does a good job because I've never tasted any ""mistakes"" in their cooking. Their prices are very reasonable, & again - it's definitely worth a try if you're in the area & want to bring home some warm comfort food. Just make sure that you've got sour cream at home - it's not authentic Uki unless you've covered it in obscene amounts of sour cream!"

dWMCiIBAvNk3sHi9fWakcw,U0yWqxj_eG0DSpprr2RDKw,"Purchased a Note 5 here recently and that all went fine. Was upsold on the Jetpack and I should have known better, that's where the problem started. 

Was told I had 14 days to return anything. Great. Returned the Jetpack 10 days later because I decided I didn't need it. ""Well you have to pay the $40 restocking fee."" Ooooookay. 

""Well do I still get hit with the activation fee?""

""We'll put a credit on your account for it.""

You can see where this is going. The credit was never applied, so I ended up having to pay $80 for activation and restocking of a piece of equipment I didn't really want. 

That's not the worst part. The worst part is they never actually cancelled the Jetpack line so I am still being charged for the access to a device I returned two months (and two bills) ago. 

Whatever you do do not let them upsell you on the Jetpack, and if they tell you they're going to put a credit on your account make sure you get proof of it.

Better yet go to Bestbuy."
DZ0hUkFyvaPr6kDaB1v9Wg,1tE8CWH4NXLdt8B_O0TmcQ,"We had a family vacation at Cottonwood Cove this summer.We rented everything through Forever Resorts. I had a good experience with the rentals and communication with the employees,however after the vacation I never received any help from the company at all regarding the situation described below.  Each time, I would ask to speak to a manager and be assured they would call me back and no one ever did. This would make me extremely cautious in dealing with this company again.The vacation and boats were nice enough although the lake is very windy.  We rented the houseboat and speedboat for a week as well as purchased all insurance.  This is our third time on a houseboat vacation.  It is what happened after that I would caution anyone to take their business elsewhere. On the way in from vacation it was extremely windy and our boat wasn't working properly so we called three times and asked for assistance. They instructed us to just keep coming.  When we finally had to be rescued, we were told the propellers were broken and the intense spinning caused by continuing on, had cracked the engines. Maybe if they had come after the first phone call, all of this could have been avoided but we will never know.   My family was devastated and had saved for a long time for this trip. Nevertheless, we left all of our contact information and were told we would be contacted and they would be fair.  After six months, I received a charge on my credit card for an additional $2200 without anyone ever contacting me or my husband after we left multiple numbers and had been trying to communicate with Forever Resorts where we rented the boat and Cottonwood Cove Marina.  Finally, after stopping payment on the charge(first time in my life I have ever done this), I finally got through on the phone to Terry, the marina manager.  He was extremely rude and just told me it was in their right  per the contract to charge me without discussing what the charges were for or without even seeing an invoice.  When I questioned why they told us to keep coming he stated, ""If you want to even suggest this was our fault, I am done talking to you.""  This was my first contact with him after 6 months and I felt like a fair question to ask when faced with paying an additional $2200 after we had already spent over $10,000 for a house boat, speed boat, rentals of skis, wake board and all of the gas. I feel this is just unfair business especially since I live 7 hours away and cannot just go to the location to discuss matters. Please plan your vacation elsewhere.  I have also sent letters to both companies."

But this year I really needed to update things. As suggested by their designer new recessed lighting, lighting controls & under cabinet lights were added in rental kitchen to upgrade & increase rental potential. This company does high-end homes & is up on the latest technology so when they told me about a control 4 system that would allow me to control everything - lights, TV, music, etc from my iPhone I decided to go for it in my home.

We had a elderly cat that required numerous medications and special food and Daniel made sure to document every little step but also checked in every day for the first week to ensure dosage and timing was correct. We received daily pictures and reports to help set our mind at ease as well. He's meticulous, friendly and treated our cats like his own.

I come here more for groceries now than I do anything else. Things tend to be out of stock frequently. The bakery area is one of the high points. They have good cakes, donuts and cookies. 

I don't ever interact with workers. When I come in, I know what I want and don't need help. I use the self check out when I leave because it's quick and I never purchase many items.

dukZ5XrXMMu21SnGjPF4_g,PNb0N5HzbVTyeG2OguPevw,"While Dobra is probably the best tea shop in the entire metro, like Teavana they tend to cater to the American and Chinese palates. Lots of tisanes (non-tea infusions), ""chai"", green, oolong and white teas but black doesn't get much love. Teavana is even worse in that oolong is even more absent and forget about the chai, it's a poor imitation. Dobra caters to ppl who fancy themselves as world travelers and Teavana caters to soccer moms and hipsters. 

Capital Teas is kinda the runt of the litter in terms of brand cache and profit but they make up for that in catering to a more British, Indian or Thai palate as their selection has a lot of nice robust blacks and smooth oolongs, and their Earl Grey, my personal favorite, is phenomenal! Unfortunately they're also about as pricey as Teavana, which for the earl grey I bought was actually quite justified. I probably wouldn't make that purchase often though. Also, instead of going for all sorts of funky mixes and tisanes like Teavana, they seem to focus a lot more on quality than sheer novelty.

For this particular store, my interaction with the staff was pretty good. They didn't get in my face in a hard-sell style, they patiently asked if I was looking for anything in particular and stepped to the side and let the store speak for itself when I said I was just browsing. They were prompt in answering my questions too, even though it was right after Black Friday, and they were still getting a deluge of customers. 

Overall good experience, that one star off is for the prices b/c I know at least a few of those teas prolly aren't worth $20/lb (ballpark figure; can't remember the exact rate)."

She was a joy to talk to as well, a complete sweetheart.  I do wish they had bio gel or the option for gel tips, since I tend to beat my hands up a bit.  I have never had just gel before, so we'll see how they hold up. It was also kind of pricey- I can get a bio gel set and pedi for a little less elsewhere and it lasts about 4 weeks for me.

LNLzlo6mpIcsvrFlB1vrTg,rAZog0bXVU9Mura8bR1GWw,"I had stressful night with them. Trust me, I do my nails regularly and this was by far the bizarre experience I had with them. 

I asked for Shellac price and they said $25. I thought, 'Wow, great price, is that because it's in suburb?' (I usually do my nails in downtown near my work). So I went. 

Apparently, $25 is just for the colour! Normally, when I go to any other nail salon, they usually quote the full service price (with removing cuticles, shaping and massage the hand and arm at the end). In full, it was $35, which was actually even more expensive than my downtown one I go. 

My cuticles weren't so bad so I let it go. 

Then the colouring. Holy shit. that was the worse brush work I ever seen in my 'nail salon' life! the colour wasn't evened out, and I can see the 2nd layer brush work, 3rd layer brush work, and there was visible streaks! 

I think I could have done better job with my left hand than this woman! 

They don't ""clean"" or wipe the place so the nail filing dust sits on the nail and she just paint it over. I could see the bumps. 

Even more, I was amazed because she was already putting ""top coat"" when she knew it wasn't good. Great work ethics! 

She glued my skin to my nail so much that she had to yank-it and filing it rough- i thought she was carving my flesh out. LOL 

And also, she colour on top of the cuticle that wasn't groomed and I was like WTF? Aren't they suppose not to go over the cuticle?! I was complaining to the owner and first she said ""It's very hard to control with Shellac"" Are you kidding me!?! ISn't it WHY I""M PAYING YOU TO DO MY NAILS!?!!? then she said having coat over the uncleaned cuticle will make the colour stay longer. Are you kidding me?!? What's wrong with you!!?! 

Seriously they ruined my evening. The owner was trying to ""fix"" it, but I didn't want to risk my nails with these ppl especially for shellac. She did take off all the damage the other girl did. She went MAD when I told her I want to go instead of letting her to re-do the job. My nails were already damaged enough from scrapping the whole thing out. Plus, what's the guarantee that you will do better job than her? I don't think so. 

Pick the salon wisely people especially when you are not doing normal manicure.

She was bragging about her 17 years of experience with regular customers coming, but lady, I got better nail salon quality from other place than yours. Trust me.

and... what she said really hit the final pissing me off contest. 

she was saying how she pays rent and stuff and how she work so hard in demanding tone (insinuating that I should pay even though the other girl ruined my nails and whole freakin' show)... which I got truly offended.... We all work hard for our money!!! You think your money is hard earned money and my money grow on tree!?! Don't even bring up your money problem when you don't even know me."

The prices are reasonable and I have scored some nice finds on the dollar rack as you walk in. If you donate they give you a 10% discount card and it's for a good cause. Overall a good place to pop into if you are in the neighbourhood.

A friend of mine tested my battery and said it was about dead, and I needed A new one. We took the battery back to AutoZone and they kept it overnight and found that it would not take a charge. So I guess that means a new battery for me. But I really appreciated their service because if the battery could have been charged, that would've save me the whole hassle of dealing with getting my battery replaced.

There were 6 of their own taps and 2 guest taps. We got a flight for all of them. They were all pretty good. There was a saison, an IPA, and an APA. I can't remember what the others were. I'm hoping to come back some time and try any new taps!"

QWKwqPmjMj9E5F4W4fFwpw,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,"Gardenview belongs in the ""enhanced"" convenience store category with Rabba and 7-11 - maybe a super convenience store? Essentially there is a LOT of selection and because it's open all night, there is always a random assortment of characters in the store looking to buy stuff. Among the things I've rushed in to buy at the last minute: flowers, birthday candles, WD-40, Triscuits, wet catfood (they actually sell a really good brand called Wellness - surprising), a jar of almonds, soymilk and soy ice cream. 

Also, Gardenview is the only place in Toronto (that I've seen!) that sells Stroopwafel, the Dutch wafer cookies. They're right by the cash and cost about $4 a bag, and taste just like 'home'!"
9g1PWYfQ4UGW8hBtOlHTpA,JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg,"This was my first experience using movers - prior to this move I'd successfully moved to nine apartments with the help of friends and pizza parties - so I have little to compare it to. 

When three friends helped me move the same amount of stuff to my last apartment, the move took 2.5 hours. With two moving professionals it took 3.5 hours plus thirty minutes' travel time to the new place. I was anticipating that it'd take less than three hours and would cost about $250 but it ended up costing $400 plus tip. I still haven't figured out the math but that seems like a lot more than I was quoted. Whatever - at least I didn't have to lift a box, right?

The movers were almost half an hour late but luckily I wasn't in a rush to get out of my current place or into my new one. The two guys, Nathan and Jordan, were very friendly and professional and had done many, many moves before this one. 

I'm pretty sure part of the reason the move took so long was because they wrapped so much of stuff in blankets and bubble - a lot of it unnecessarily. The instructions that I gave were basic - nothing was really fragile and certainly nothing was antique or vintage. Just throw it in the truck and let's go. At one point I saw one of the guys wrapping my shitty 1980s 19"" TV as if it was a rare Faberge Egg - this is the same TV that I couldn't shake on Craigslist for $20.

They didn't bring the standing wardrobes as advertised and also requested - because of this I had to wrap my hanging clothes in garbage bags at the last minute and most of them barely it into my new closet intact - everything kept falling off the hangers and onto the floor. Needless to say this was a huge nuisance. I was most looking forward to seeing this marvel of moving.

The movers aren't insured to bring you to your new apartment as a passenger in their truck, so if like most people in the city you don't have access to a car, be prepared to take a cab or beg a friend (my method) to drive you to your new apartment. I didn't know about this rule so luckily a friend was able to pull through at the last minute. If the moving company beats you there they won't get started till you arrive so it's worth it to leave a little earlier than they do. 

Nothing was broken or damaged and I was overall happy with the move - just wish it had taken less time and not been so pricey. Be prepared to spend more than you had anticipated and you'll be OK. 

Also, try to have water or some other beverage handy for the movers - they were sweating up a storm and it was 30C outside (and probably in my apartment as I'd already turned off the A/C), and I had packed all my glasses and had nothing to drink. So think ahead on this one!

Payment by cash or cheque (tip only by cash)."
yEwKJManrwQegby8SoI-7Q,hyvR2B4uxhHtx3WifjgsjQ,"Called in the same day to make an appointment and was lucky there was availability for three ladies.

This place is conveniently located on Lakeshore.

The service is very good here. The masseuses are very skilled and pleasant.

This place is a little older and the rooms have very thin walls as I could hear the conversations next door.

The bathroom didn't seem to update, but clean.

I got a massage and the masseuse was great and it was an good one.  I just found some of the products used seemed like just some regular over the counter oils and lotions.  I have been to spas and usually you get some exotic smelling ones that leave your skin feeling fantastic.  

Overall the service is what I go for and I got that, but overall spa experience was a little lacking.  Realistically I do give it a 3.5 stars.  

The prices are very affordable and I would return again for a quick 30 minutes."

I've tried it twice, and give it 2 nopes up. Lemon Chicken was dry even after it was drenched in the sugary lemon sauce and was more breading than meat. Seafood Delight consisted of a lot of cheap, mealy Surimi, scallops that were undoubtedly white fish cut into circles, plenty of shrimp (hurray for that!) and at the bottom of the container a hunk of what might have been lobster. The General Tso's, the only Chinese food my husband enjoys, was more breading than meat.

Went here to watch the Raiders on Sunday Night Football. I had great service at the bar, but in retrospect I wish I would have sat in one of the recliners - probably a slightly better view of the TVs, and, well, after walking 20K steps a day, someplace to put my feet up.

The only issue I had, which is so minor, is that they had no beer list. But, the bartender told me that their selection changes practically weekly, so it's hard to keep up that way. The bartenders were definitely knowledgeable and every time I told them what I was looking for, they found me a beer that was exactly what I wanted.

Like I said you can get beer anywhere on the Strip, but if you want GOOD beer and a GREAT selection this is the place to check out."

I received burns to 35% of my left leg and 10% of my right foot.  I broke my ankle, hip, tailbone, back in 4 spots, busted disc's in my back, broke 3 ribs, sternum, collar bone and jaw.  I puncher my lung and received a deep puncher wound to the left upper hamstring.  As a result, I had my achilles tendon removed and 2 1/2 toes on my right foot amputated.  I spent 5 months in a hospital bed and went through 15 surgeries, longest one lasting 13 hours.  
  On 3 Nov 2010 I was finally discharged and flew home.  I could not walk and spent all of my time in a wheelchair due to my injuries and muscle atrophy.  I had lost 80lbs of muscle.  I was then referred to Active Life Health & Wellness of Las Vegas from a friend.
After 2 weeks of theory, I was able to walk.  
Week 3: I was able to walk straight up without pain.
Week 4:  Able to walk without a cane
Week 5: Able to work out at the gym
  I am still seeing gains.  Chronic back problems that I had before my incident have gone away.  I remember having to do a ""Sumo Squat"" to wash my face in the morning.  Since seeing this office, I have no back problems, even after I broke my back.  Skin problems are a thing of the past, as well as my heartburn.  I feel REALLY HEALTHY!  
  The thing I love the most has to be the relationship you build with the people that work here.  The highlight of my day is going to get my corrections and do my daily exercises while socializing with the nurses, doctors, and other patients.  It is a very healty atmosphere.  Never seen anything like it.  
  In the end, this place is great.  They don't make minor corrections that will keep you having to come to them forever.  They find the root cause of the problem and fix it permanetly.  But... see for yourself.

DZ0hUkFyvaPr6kDaB1v9Wg,AUczbLy3ZFgBqACSPONWUw,"When we arrived at the Marina it only took about 5 minutes to realize we were in trouble.The temperature was in excess of 100 degrees with zero shade at the Marina. First you need to flag down a cart to unload the 1,000 worth of frozen meat we brought from home along with the additional 1,000 spent at the local Wal Mart. Standing at the curb with 2,000 worth of food in 100 degree weather with no shade was just the beginning.

When we headed down to the dock after confirming several hours earlier from Las Vegas that we were able to board at 5PM, we were met with what was clearly a well rehearsed series of mis-directions along the lines of ""Who did you talk to?"" ""We are Antelope Point Boat Rentals not Forever Resorts"" What are you talking about? I pointed to a houseboat with FOREVER RESORTS painted on the side.
The conversation was useless. They had no boat ready for us. We spent the next 5 hours trying to load our belongings while they emptied trash, pumped sewage, fixed a shower and tried to get the lights working on the front deck. Only one BBQ worked between the two boats and one range and microwave between the two boats for the majority of the trip.
Deceptive Business Practices
Your staff also failed to credit us the 110. per boat per day gas credit special which added up to several thousand dollars. When asked why it wasn't on the contract I was told ""again that's Forever Resorts deal, we are Antelope Point Marina.""   What the F#@K? Your boat out there says FOREVER RESORTS. Pull up their website the special is right there. They half heartedly agreed after I insisted they look at www. ForeverResorts.com.
After a few minutes they changed the contract to include the gas credit. At no big surprise to me when we got home the final invoice included NO CREDIT whatsoever. They agreed, pretended to have taken care of it and a week after I get home I get this email.
Here's the final bill. Note the gas credit of .02 for both boats. Deceptive lying p&@cks.


The true age and condition of their boats was not revealed to us until we had paid in full and arrived on the dock. 

I have owned and operated several boats for more than 30 years.  

We have owned a home on a Lake with a boat dock for the last decade. We have an oceanfront home now. We are water people.

We spent 30,921.28 just for lodging fuel and rental fees to make a trip to Lake Powell. This was our 4th time there in the last 15 years. It was the High School Graduation Gift for our 18 Year Old Son before he headed off to College. We will never have another chance to do this. 

Early Boarding Rip-off Fee
For an early boarding fee of 907.00 we had the pleasure of being parked next to a garbage processing station on the Marina Dock. It was disgusting, unsanitary and smelled only what you could imagine rotting garbage smells like after being baked inside of this trash dumpster in 100 degree weather. I don't know how the Arizona Health Department or National Park Service Administration allows this. How can they allow people to sleep next to this?
I mean really. 

Because we relied on their assurances about early boarding we made no other arrangements for lodging. We had no choice but to sleep next to it.

Generators Fail. 

7 Adults and 2 small children were forced to use one houseboat. 
Repeated attempts to contact the Marina on channel 16 VHF were ignored. 
We also told you guys we had two 6 year children on board. 
We are obviously not the only problem boat out there. Another boater heard us on the VHF Radio and told us they too were broken down and without power, had been trying to contact the marina and were also stranded in Last Chance Bay. They said their boat number was 482.

We abandoned one boat and returned to the Marina only to have our intelligence insulted to clearly divert attention from the negligent actions on your part and the horrible condition of your aged houseboats. 
Acknowledging the issues you immediately offered 6,000 reduction in the bill to my wife who was left fending for herself with your staff while I coordinated the unloading of our belongings and packing for the trip home. She told you she would discuss it and get back to you once we got home.

Aramark at Wahweap Marina is 1000% better. Don't waste your time here."

Not at this one. The man who runs this subway is a jolly round man who goes by ""Lucky."" He talks with his customers, he jokes with them, and if you go frequently enough he'll remember your order, and ask how you have been since the last time you ate there. He's a great guy.

In addition to the wonderful service you get, this subway is VERY clean. I have been to plenty of subways where lettuce is on the counter, the tables are dirty, the floors are icky, and the soda machine is a mess. Lucky respects his store, his customers, and the Subway chain. The entire building is spotless.

Lastly, the decГіr. It has the typical subway look, but for Christmas it has been decked out! Each table has a mini Christmas tree, and a few other decorations are around as well.

Overall, I will definitely be returning, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this subway for great service and quality you can trust."

Typical movie theater deal, the tickets aren't TOO expensive, but if you want popcorn and drinks, be prepared to shell out an additional 20 bucks."

That being said.  Good thing I purchased the tickets early.  The game was sold out.  Got a voice confirmation, followed up to confirm again, got a confirmation number, saved it and presented it to the cheery girl behind the window the day of the game.
No problem."
MZu26QY2vvpCWFNWGmTNLg,WSxmKeQOEP5Wqe2DsMsNBA,"I cannot say enough good things about Ken, Jeff and Mike of BHB!  We hired them to do a complete remodel of our master bath and master bedroom. After meeting with several contractors, Ken was the most thorough and professional in getting back to me with a quote. They were honest about the fact that we were opening up floors and walls, and that additional costs would possibly come up. As we got into the project, I was able to relax and trust that they would take care of everything and were looking ten steps ahead. They were there with each and every sub to make sure the scope of work was understood. All of the subs were trustworthy and quality craftsmen! We are 100% satisfied with the results and recommend these honest and hardworking people to all.
We hired a contractor to supervise (or do themselves) and guide us through this complex project. They were worth every penny!"

I was greeted when I entered the store and with a quick glance it seemed pretty clean and well organized. I went at lunch time so it was not too busy. 

I was able to find all the items I was looking for in stock so that was super helpful. The cashier were friendly and the line moved fast. 

The only downside was to the grocery section. Some items were hidden and it took me a while to find the crackers and the granola bars. The food sections are divided in a way that is not very convenient. 

Other than the grocery section it seems to be a pretty good location and I would return to make a four chase in the future."

She's been my stylist ever since and today my hair looks better than ever. She's very knowledgeable, she takes the time to listen to what I want, she asks questions to make sure she understands and she delivers every time. She keeps track of what we've done in the past and knows what's best for my hair, what I would like and what I wouldn't. Besides the fact that Pam is a very talented professional, she has a great personality and is always such a pleasure to get my hair done. Highly recommend!!!"

This establishment is clean and presentable, the restrooms are not maintained by the Starbucks as it is located inside an Albertsons 

Hospitality: 3 Stars
The service is a little on the faster side for an average Starbucks. The draw back is walking inside of the Albertsons, sometimes parking is difficult. 

Food: 5 stars
Always accurate and consistent with quality. I love Starbucks

Bottom line: This location is on one of my travel paths and I use it regularly. I will continue to patron this establishment."

He went over all of our options including pros and cons of each. He then had our new state of the art pump (my husband calls it the Cadillac of pumps ) up and running within 24 hours! 

From the moment he arrived, I felt like he truly cared and his work already shows he does! My only regret is we didn't find him sooner! Good news is we know our pool is in good hands from this moment forward!

A genuinely friendly staff that knows their stuff -- I was looking for a signed Guy LaFleur photo, and while they didn't have one in stock they were the only store where the staff didn't stare blankly at the name ""Guy LaFleur.""

What I particularly like about Tristar is that they have a range of goods for sale at all price points. I'm thrilled that a visiting Middle Eastern prince can show up in Vegas and spend $50,000 on Derek Jeter's signed left testicle, but not all of us have that kind of money. Tristar has a very nice collection of signed 8x10s across a variety of sports, for reasonable prices. And if you're looking for an autograph by any non-superstar, they're the only game on the strip. I got myself a signed Scott Stevens' photo for a ~$25.00, and as a Devils fan it was a great addition to my office wall."

5e4Wi0lzkOL67UUTTGIWDA,8KD04ydiVkT3I2kuG3JF6w,"So I have had Mediterranean cuisine tons of times. But oddly enough I had not had Lebanese until a couple months ago in Berlin. This qualifies as my second time. 

The storefront keeps you expectations low. As you pull up nothing fancy or flashy. Walk-in same thing. Given that I waa pretty hungry the large menu of choices were a little overwhelming. I quickly asked the guy at the counter if there a plate of some sort that they offer with the spit fired chicken as the protein. He says yea no problem...rice, potatoes, salad...does that work for you? Simple enough. Paid for my food. Sat down. From the first bite I knew I was in for a treat. Supremely flavorful, fresh. NOTHING on the plate did not taste wonderful. My favs...

The chicken was tender, seasoned delightful and paired with the sauce awesome. The rice was not hard as you find some when they are buffet style. Fluffy and tasty. The potatoes and salad were quite good as well. 

Not sure why, but Atlanta is missing exactly this type of restaurant. Reasonably priced, delicious ethnic food (although we have some pretty good Thai and Mexican spots) without a ton of fake fanfare and praise. 

The meal cost me $13 CAD and they do take Visa/Mastercard. Would definitely be back if I were staying in the area. And by the way...I still love Greek food but have found in traveling...Lebanese, Turkish and Palestinian food to be even more flavorful. Who would have thought."
SqxYhx0znOqCfaVIc7c-FA,B2cAVkDQJ3GgLbYyMihaeg,"Menu seems all over the place, they have a wide variety but master nothing.  

I ate the Monte Cristo which was great, but the fact I got fries that was not informed were and extra $2 for a total of, get this, 15 fries.  $2....15 fries.   I get that since restaurants jacked the price of soda to the cost of a 2 liter per glass everyone stopped drinking soda at restaurants now they are charging $2 for half a potato worth of fries.  Seriously?  I could buy a bag of potatoes and make 4 pounds of my own fries for that amount.

Over all, though the food is good it is not worth the $5 for just a sandwich I could make at home."

o0OD0UdzNpAJ1CTlW9Emsg,0FPSkxLj49bsOwx2aA3Zbg,"Sho Papazian is the most reliable, easy going, knowledgeable and best dog trainer we have ever met. She has been training my 2-year dog for a couple months now (excessive barking, anti-social, anxious, leash pulling, insecure, marking and excessive chewing). After the first lesson we saw a marked improvement in our dog. Since then we have been doing in home training as well as boarding and the progress our dog has made is absolutely incredible, I can barely recognize that he is the same dog. All the wanted behaviors have stopped, he has learned commands and we have learned how to properly correct him when he is displaying any unwanted behaviors. Additionally we have learned how to take back the dominant role, productively drain his high energy and keep him calm and happy. We would not have been able to accomplish this with out Sho (we tried for 2 years and things only got worse until we reached out to Sho for help). We are so impressed and amazed everyday with what he has learned as well as what we have learned from Sho and this experience. We are absolutely thrilled to have found Sho and feel incredibly lucky to have her as our dog trainer."

The prices are not too expensive for most of the items but if you're looking for unique piece from designer they also have those. The clothes for men are also very nice and you can find kitchen and bathroom accessories. All their employees are very kind and they're really there to help and not sell (they aren't paid by commission).  This Simons (Anjou) is definitely my favorite Simon between St-Bruno, Montreal and Anjou i'll say i prefer Anjou. Simon Anjou is brand new and the shopping experience is perfect. There's plenty of place to walk and look at everything in the store."

The food is good - there's daily specials like 1c steak, 45c wings, half-price fish & chips, $3.99 burgers & fries, etc. The clientele goes from suits (after work hours) to homeless (sometimes, at night)....but it's near my apartment and I do end up here more often than I'd like to admit. 

It's warm and it's cozy. The waitresses (there's usually only one at a time) are friendly and are on top of things. There's also a jukebox (needs some updating with the classic rock n roll selection though) that I've spent countless change on. It tends to be rather empty at nights since it's on the tail end of Queen St. and the clubbers coming into the city are headed to Richmond St. But hey, like I said it's near my apartment and it's an ok place to have a few drinks (just have to remind myself to go easy on the pints, lol)."

Leaving here for the first time, I wanted to meet them all down at the bar and buy them a drink.  I walked in knowing NOTHING about re-seeding a lawn and I was scared to see what might be involved.  Folks at the register both said ""Hello"" in a genuine way.  I was asked if they could help me by 2 different people as we made our way to the grass section.  I was scared to admit I needed help at first.  Within about 20 seconds after looking at the grass seed, over walked our guy.  I really wish I could remember his name because he was awesome.  He said, ""You two look like you could use some help.  Let me point you in the right direction.  Whatcha looking to do?"" It was too good to be true.  So we told him tentatively.  He pointed us in the right direction, walked us over to show us options for equipment, talked about how to save money by doing it another way, and then gave us his personal tips on keeping birds off the grass without having to pay for some fancy tent system.  

This was our first experience, which is why it's stuck out to me, but I've been there a few times since then, and it's the same every time.  Everyone is SO nice!!!  And helpful.  The only person I've ever talked to who didn't know an answer COMPLETELY - called over his buddy to finish up where he left off.  Amazing.  I used to be a Home Depot girl, but I've officially made the switch on where I go first.  This Ace won't have everything a HD would, but if they don't have something they'll tell you up front - and sometimes they'll suggest where you go to get it.  Truly the helpful hardware place."

The staff is top notch. Everyone is friendly and helpful. I will say that Harbor Bay's stuff seems to shrink significantly even when we are doing cold wash and line drying. So it may be worth getting a tall size even if you are not tall. Other than that, I limit myself to a couple trips per year because otherwise I wouldn't have much of a paycheck left!"
qIJwdWYjv8Zkev7zvOXsOw,iIlapFJx_ut5_jMtnRBYoQ,"I couldn't wait to come home and write my 1 star review.  Today March 10, 2018, I went to this Thomas and Hayden store, as I have been getting my water tested here for years, way back when they were NPS.  But today someone I don't recall seeing before, named Joshua who told me ""We aren't doing water tests.""  I thought ""....anymore?  as a free service?""  He said ""Today, because it's raining.""  I thought he was KIDDING.  I was sooooo shocked,  and continued to stare at his face, waiting for him to say ""I was just kidding.""   But, he stood his ground.   I said I was going out of town for a while and just added almost a gallon of acid and some chlorine, and wanted to see where I was at before I left town.  

Joshua was VERY adamant about not testing my water and said, ""We do not test water when it rains because then it will be inaccurate and we would be giving out false information and we don't give out false information here.""  I said it isn't even raining, and the ground everywhere is all dry, and I took the sample before a few drops came down hours ago.   

Joshua then said that if I collected the sample a few hours ago, then it is inaccurate anyways.  When I said I wanted him to test the water regardless, I don't care how ""inaccurate it is"", he still refused but said ""I CAN SELL YOU A TEST KIT AND YOU CAN TEST IT YOURSELF!""

Boy, that REALLY made me mad, and I left and drove to my usual Leslie's store at Chaparral and Hayden in Safeway shopping center, and Gordon tested my water immediately, without question.  I asked Gordon ""if it was Corporate policy"" that Leslie's not test water if it is raining, Gordon said ""No.""  I told Gordon what happened at the Hayden and Thomas store and he burst out laughing and said it was so funny, cos he heard of people ""saying stuff like that"" (that they won't test water when it rains).  He heard of pool stores putting a sign up ""water test equipment broken"".  ""He just doesn't wanna do it!"", Gordon said.   He said, laughing, ""I gotta tell Mike (the other employee not working today) what you said, he'll get a kick outta that"". 

Later I called the Chaparral store back and said to Gordon, ""I forgot to tell you, after Joshua was so adamantly standing his ground and refusing to test my water, he said 'I CAN SELL YOU A TEST KIT AND YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF !""  

""Thanks for making my day with that story"", he said laughing, ""It gets juicier and juicier.  Mike will get a kick out of it"".  

Boy, I don't think it is funny at all, I am still fuming with disbelief."

I was looking for the small red beauty blenders I got my first set at the morphe store in Burbank Cali and I loved them, before asking anyone I decided to walk around the store, after not being able to find them and picking up other goodies I needed, I decided to ask an employee if they carried the small red beauty blenders,

 (she was stocking some of the bigger beauty blenders on the shelf so I thought it be easier to ask her)

After I asked her if they had any small blenders 
She sarcastically replied ""we don't carry beauty blenders here "" I said they are small red blenders like these (pointing to the bigger ones) 

She said I'm sorry we don't sell beauty blenders in this store. I said ""then what are these"" she said ""blenders"" 

I said never mind - and walked away - 

Maybe I'm over reacting but it's only day two and she was acting like she hated her job already - maybe she needs more customer service skills - 

Anyways I mentioned this to my cashier he was super awesome - asked him what her name was 
He said ""Alexandra or Alexandria "" can't really remember

I took Arron's my 2000 Porsche Boxster for an oil change, miscellaneous other service needs, and a drivability issue, I had previously had another shop in Roseburg look at it for the drivability issue, they did several tests, replaced a few needed parts, and said they would start with replacing the oxygen sensors to see if that would fix it, I decided that I really didn't want them just guessing at the problem and throwing parts at it.
I found Arron's was a sponsor of the Cascade region Porsche Club web page that I am a member of and thought I'd try them.
So I called to set up an appointment, this was the start of an impressive experience for me.
When I arrived, I was greeted by my first name, we then went over the list of service I was having performed and approximate cost and time involved, they then put me in a loaner car for my 75 mile journey home.
I was called less than two hours after leaving and informed they had found the problem and gave me the costs to replace and repair it! Something that the other shop took several visits and still were unable to fix or diagnose,
I can't express my gratitude and joy that I have found a professional, courteous, and knowledgeable shop I can trust that actually really cares about me, and my vehicle!

He said well if I did that, that means you would have to come back and follow up with me and I'm getting the feeling you don't want to see me.

My parents attempting to be nice came in from out of state and called a locksmith to have my front door lock changed since I've been dealing with so much else. They gave an estimate lower than a different place we had called in the morning, so they were scheduled. When the guy showed up, he stated that what he can't just re-key a lock, that it has to be completely changed out and that it would cost $175. Which was $100 more than the highest estimate they gave via phone, even though the person on the phone said that they could provide that service. When I said no, he said fine but you owe me the $35 service charge, I told him no charge was done because he wanted to do something completely different, and I knew he could re-key the lock by simply changing the cylinder, he then said he didn't have cylinders, I told him that him not being prepared was not my problem considering my parents specified what was needed. He then went on to inform me of how the locks he had were such better quality. He wouldn't take no for an answer and so he went on to bargaining and said that if we paid cash that his boss would drop the price, he stated he would try to price match the other company ($120). He then called his ""boss"" and stated that he approved $145, and then tried to start, I told him to stop and said NO because he had told me he would price match for cash. So I then told him I was calling myself, he decided to call his ""boss"" again, this time I called the company myself at the same time. He immediately ""hung up"" and said that he had gotten the approval for the $120 but got super upset that I was calling myself and went on to tell my dad that was very uncool of me to call when he was the one negotiating with his ""boss"" and that I should've just taken his word for it, he began to get an attitude with my dad, as the guy on the phone was doing the same to me. I verbally went off on the guy on the phone, and cannot specify the words I used, but once I hung up, I intervened with the service guy and my dad and told him just to do his job and that I would pay him just to get it done and leave since he was forcing me to pay him a service fee anyway. He did his job, I paid him, and he left. I went on to explain to my parents that they should look up reviews prior to scheduling anything due to unpleasant situations like this, it sucked but we all learned. So they deserve -10 stars in my book.., such dicks!!!!"

Is there a water surcharge I'm not familiar with lol? Not too thrilled about that but it is the airport. The line was long and went slow. There was more than one person on duty but the other person was just standing around and didn't open another register. I spent more time in this store than I wanted to just standing on line. The cashier also stepped away from the line to talk to the other employee and answer the phone which made it take even longer. I don't see why the other employee couldn't do that instead. After my exhausting trip I really just wanted to get off my feet. I almost walked out."

Ended up with more dental work than I've had in the past ten years, and spent more out of pocket than I had in the past ten years.

The final visit was with a new Hygienst which missed on an injection and caught my Lingual Nerve.  I called to ask for some direction or treatment that may help and never got a call back.  After a week, and my tongue still being numb I called again.  Finally got a return call from Dr Benson explaining what happened and what some possible treatments might be.

It has now been six weeks since that mis-hap by the new Hygienst and my tongue is still numb.  Asking another Denist friend about it, he shared that it could take 3-9 months or 3-9 years for the numb and damage to the lingual nerve to heal.

Very disapointed, yet also understand that during the injection this could happen with a newer Hygienst.   YET, I'm the one that gets to bite my tongue daily, can't taste my coffee in the moring and have hard time eating or drinking until it heals.

I would think you would get more than a phone call, especially after you have to call twice to get infomration on what is going on."

She was very personable and apologetic. She took the time to listen to what happened and my concerns at the time.  She expressed numerous times how sorry she was about what happened and agreed I should have never experienced the treatment I was given.  To the company's benefit, they no longer employ the previous office manager and certain teachers including the one my child regrettably had.  
Overall, our conversation was pleasant and respectlful.  The owner even offered to refund the fees I lost due to the incident.  I have not taken my daughter back to a dance class with PSMD so this review is based solely on my telephone experience with the company owner.

Y4Ec0GD8s_FuB5tKXJOkbQ,h5eVBQ5DyrpnQOaJ9ycl3g,"I was walking around vieux-port and suddenly got really hungry. I turn my head and see this place. It looks friendly and inviting. A lot of green, so probably healthy, right? I take a look at the menu and it looks great! Quiche, sandwiches, soups, salads, lots of great stuff! Oh and lots of desserts! 

We go in and we were immediately greeted by a smiling waiter. He let up pick the seats we wanted and brought the menus over. Actually, the menus are on the placemats. I thought it was pretty cheap! 

I got a huge piece of onion quiche (1/4 of a humongous quiche) as well as a Mille feuilles made with beets and goat cheese with herbs. 

The food took quite some time to come out (in their dГ©fense, it was 2pm, so maybe te kitchen wasn't ready?), but it smelled SO GOOD! The quiche (12$) was nice and hot and the Mille feuilles (6$) looked delicious. 

I dived into the Mille feuilles first. Oh my gosh! It was totally worth the wait!! The ingredients were so simple, but somehow when they were combined, it was just an explosion of deliciousness! You have to get it! You must! 

After the mind blowing that the Mille feuilles has done, the quiche wasn't has amazing, but it was still delicious! I was so full after finishing it!  

They also had some huge meringues that I would've wanted to try, but I was way too full. 

All in all, super delicious food, but I have to remove one star because of the wait."

l5VyYW6ApAP7iWRC1ooZ1w,C-QKyxxPkCGAldtjj7dW7g,"I frequently stay at The Old Mill for events or a simple retreat and touristy visit for the city. Home Smith is the bar/lounge and it has a lot of things going for it, with a few detractors. 

The Goods
- The atmosphere is great. Comfy seating, nooks and crannies to retreat into, a fireplace, classic decor, and a good view of the river (though it could benefit from larger windows)
- They have great food. The food here is better than the main restaurant actually. The macaroni and cheese is great on a cool day, the steak frites is fantastic, and the calamari is great for sharing
- They have some unique cocktails, though some with a pretty hefty price tag
- Live Jazz. They have jazz events throughout the year and the music is very good - though get there early to you can sit further back - because it's loud at the bar 
- the bathroom has the prettiest sink I've ever seen

The cons
- Two beers: Guinness and Stella? Come on now, grow with the times and get something craft or at least unique. It's pretty clear someone said ""let's get a dark beer and let's get a light beer"". You were happy to see these duo in a bar 20 years ago, but times be a changing
- the cocktail menu is pretty pricey and gets old fast. It needs an update. 

Anyways - Enjoy. It's a pretty classy place and a nice retreat."

The staff were so accommodating and knowledgeable and helped each girl find a pair that worked. After explaining about our organization and what we do, they gave us a really generous discount on the entire purchase! They were so helpful and kind.

dqST39RCLARoZ1JvfVHwag,TUzdqtQpOgl_zXMp-trgXw,"I came to Barre Life while I was visiting family in Oakville. I'm a Pure Barre addict, so I HAD to find a barre studio during this trip. Barre Life had a great introductory special: unlimited classes for two weeks for only $40. Yay! So the studio is very nice and clean on the inside. The outside is not much to look at, though there is plenty of parking. The lobby is spacious, they have retail, and the front of the house staff are friendly. There is also a large women's locker room--always a plus. 

I took 3 classes at Barre Life: Sculpt and two level 1 classes. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety that the studio offers--I think it's great that there are different classes depending on what you're looking for (beginner, advanced, more ballet-oriented, etc). I enjoyed Sculpt the most, as it was somewhat similar to what I'm used to at Pure Barre. I like a more fast-paced and intense class as well as using different props, such as weights, balls, and resistance bands. I also enjoyed the music, which was upbeat and current.

What prevents me from giving a higher rating is related to the instruction. During one class, I was actually discouraged when I challenged myself to hold a pose--I was told by an instructor to stop when she saw that my thigh muscles were shaking. Also, I never saw any of the instructors go around the room and adjust people's forms, and I could see that several people needed adjustments, including myself. I found this to be problematic because if you don't have the correct form, you could easily injure yourself--especially your back. Maybe other instructors are more conscientious about that, though. All in all, there were more positives than negatives, but the instructor contributes heavily to the experience in my opinion. I would still try Barre Life when I visit Oakville again, since it is still a great workout."

pmaNU670HnISO_6tXD3wkA,s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,"I generally enjoyed Las Vegas' 1st Annual Asian Food Festival, and judging by the multitudes of people who were present when I was in attendance, it should be a solid financial success for organizers and food vendors. But festival organizers need to undertake much work before the next Asian Food Festival to improve logistics and their organizing of ticket sales on the festival grounds. 

Although the Orleans has numerous parking lots surrounding it and festival grounds, it took us over 20 minutes to find a parking place anywhere. At 7:30 p.m. at night, we were in competition with several vehicles that were also swirling through the many lots in search of a precious space. Then, when we reached the festival entrance on foot, a single line of several hundred people (no exaggeration) waiting to be admitted wound around from the controlled entrance. I was supposed to pick up a ticket in my name at Will Call, so Diane got in the ticket line for herself, and I looked for Will Call. But it was not so easily found! And, when I asked festival volunteers and a security guard manning the entrance, none of them knew where Will Call was either, or if there even was such a thing. I was referred to a festival manager, and she, too, appeared to be puzzled. After she sent me on a futile trip to the VIP entrance to see if my ticket was waiting for me there (it wasn't), and I returned, she finally just handed me a ticket and let me bypass the line and gain entrance. 

Meanwhile, other people who had already purchased festival tickets online were made to wait in the same line where people waited to buy tickets. I saw a few who complained to the festival manager be let in at the front of the line. But most persons with tickets in their hands had to patiently wait in the same line as the ticketless. This is not good customer service, logistics, or festival organization on the ground! 

Once Diane and I gained entrance to the festival, I watched as delighted children on top of moving mechanical animals moved in a circular pattern on the asphalt surface below them, some with a parent along for the ride. There were horses, a panda, and other beguiling creatures. Older youths were enjoying traditional, often scary carnival rides, and, while I saw very few vendors of retail items, food booths were omnipresent. Here again, substantial lines of persons waited to place food orders in front of most of the booths. But these lines were not as long as I had encountered a few weeks before at the Las Vegas Greek Food Festival. Some of the food vendors had already crossed off dishes that were no longer available, but there still appeared to be an abundance of food that should have been able to assuage the hunger of all festival attendees. I saw Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Indian, Japanese, Korean and Thai food for sale. 

I never found the Wor Wonton Soup I was hoping for, or any other soup. But egg rolls and potstickers were being offered at multiple locations, curry was available, and I saw sushi for sale, but it was the prepackaged kind. Diane liked the Shrimp Tempura she purchased at a booth run by Anna's Garden, and we both were pleased with the Hibachi Beef and Chicken, Chow Mein and Chinese Vegetables that we bought from Hibachi San Tepanyaki Grill & Fresh Sushi's booth. She had a $6 bowl, and I had an $8 plate heaping with food. The beef was a little fatty, but it still tasted good, and the food filled me up while we watched excellent entertainment. We saw Frankie Moreno perform, singers A.C.T., and the party band Impulse. Seating was difficult to find but we were able to locate two unused chairs near the stage to sit down on fairly quickly. We then listened to the talented performers for over 1-1/2 hours, and I thought this alone was worth the $7 price of admission. Water was a bit steep at $3 a bottle, but the bottles were medium size, and festival prices for food and drink are always higher than at a store. It is just the nature of the beast. The festival crowd was mellow and very diverse in race and ethnicity. All assembled seemed to be having a good time. And, so did I."

Selection is huge, specially in session items, they have a huge outdoor area with every single tree or bush or flower u can imagine. Inside the small store front, they have some patio furniture, gardening tools and supplies and then some indoor or tropical plants. They even have a small pond with some turtles in it which is always great for the kids."

They're not always open when their hours say they are though, you'll pull up and there will just be a little sign in the door that says ""will return at 2"" or something. They don't mind you just sort of milling around and looking at stuff though, so that's cool"

It was a fairly large piece that was cooked with the batch. The server replaced it from the same batch and then proceeded to serve more to the next customers. The naan bread is great, but the  vegan naan is not quite hitting the mark. Very nice staff and some really great food, just might need some more experience with food service."

The palm trees never got trimmed and I was once again charged $150 for someone to blow my yard and not even take the landscaping trash with them. They charge an extra fee of $35 dollars to take the waste with them???! Must be the only landscaper in town who does that.

I also had them tie down a tree that maybe took them 10 mins and was charged 250 dollars.

lCtnR3v8y-5o5T15SjaJ5A,rzy-EQst5wGYVxXu-kOJLA,"I've been going to Green Tara for over a year and while all the teachers at the studio are very good, Karen is by far the best.  She is an excellent instructor who is disciplined and emphasizes form, teaching you to be thoughtful and aware of your body.  What really sets her apart is that she is both yoga teacher and life coach in one, without being too self-help or corny or inaccessible.  I'm not at all new-age-y, but her classes really transcend your traditional pose/ stretch/downward-facing dog, and leave you with both a refreshed mind and body.  

The studio is small but cozy, and you get a feel for a sense of community as the classes are a good mix of long-time veterans and first-time drop-ins.  I've also taken some classes at the Yoga Room which is an amazing facility in one of the converted Little Italy school-houses, but the quality and the level of detail of teaching at Green Tara in one of Karen's classes is unmatched.  

I've only ever done Iyengar yoga (minus the yoga class I went to at a 24hr Fitness once, which was so UNNATURAL and weird), so I can't compare it to any of the other yogas, but the perfectionist in me loves the slower pace and an almost cerebral emphasis on form.  Check this place out!"
Sy9XPnOgEr7PemrYPWB7yw,x3Ep6liarHbLtagcJQIyRQ,"Friendly staff, albeit they are rather slow in preparing your order. Food is above average in taste, and good value for money, especially considering the location so close to Union Station.

We visited near close, and regrettably they had run out of a number of ingredients so couldn't offer half of the items on the menu. But considering that they were the only food store open in the area on a Saturday evening, that was understandable."
FEC44uuZ4_FeDYZ-vTCQAg,x3Ep6liarHbLtagcJQIyRQ,Very basic Tim Hortons that is essentially a drive through. There is a tiny store to go inside but it's take-out only; there's nowhere to sit and no washrooms.
oXaF-QdokYuBukmuRYODfw,rvE1HVrNza7HsuyCjfrPrA,"Terrible service and rip off.

I used this service to get from the airport to my house and the driver overcharged me by $12 dollars. His excuse was that it was an SUV. I didn't choose an SUV, it was the next vehicle in line. When I complained to their office the manager said he would look into it. I don't see what there was to look into since I provided the receipt and the address of my house. The first manager that I spoke with confirmed to me that I was in fact overcharged. 

Furthermore I'm not sure whether the driver was tired or tipsy but the vehicle swerved several times out of the lane of travel.

This is why UBER is thriving and business has dropped for taxis and limo services. I should have refused to pay at drop off.

I will never use them again."

I highly recommend the EVIL HR sandwich.  But, they have a lot of others, and you could always build your own as well.  The sandwiches come with a small dixie cup full of potato salad or macaroni salad, which are both excellent.  

They also have Dr Brown's sodas available, if you don't want fountain drinks.  Seriously, the food is delicious, and service is friendly."

I couldn't take it anymore and my benefits were just advising me to go to a location in North Carolina that was almost 45 min away then they suggested to go to a walk in clinic. When I called they said they couldn't do really anything g did me. So I googled/yelped for chiropractors near me and best review seemed to be Hall Chiropractic near me. 
Called and was told he was on vacation, but dr called me back fairly soon after to see what was going on and advised icing and would see me on day of apt. 
I was pleasantly surprised over the experience over the past several weeks that I've been going. Not only have I been having to reprogram myself from my last chiropractic experience, but I have never been given exercises to try to help speed up my recovery. 
It also helps that Yoshi keeps an eye on the patients while doc and Dialna are also a big plus to this office. I also love, Love , LOVE did I say  how it completely works without waiting for hours to see the doc!  Goes to show its a well tuned office, much better than my NY offices (don't let NY know that). And don't forget to give Yoshi his payment on the way out before you go."

  Same location; see:  RED LANTERN KITCHEN & BAR


Latest Update 2-13-13.  
CLOSED ! ---and right before LENT ! 

--- when their business could have benefited greatly from orders of their fabulous fish fries served regularly---EVERY DAY---not just on Fridays.  Not enough advertising?  I don't know.  Not enough favorable reviews?  Could be.  Loyal customers loved it.  First-timers would have too, if they had only given Red Lantern a chance.  Hopefully, this closure is temporary.

This LOCALLY-OWNED business, in operation for over THREE DECADES---that offered EXCELLENT Lake Erie Perch fish fries at fair, affordable pricing, with friendly, efficient, welcoming service, didn't deserve fighting a likely unfair battle to keep things going.  I just recently heard they weren't doing well.  That's hard to imagine, based on our perfectly satisfying experiences and especially particular palates.  I also heard that they wanted to sell.   May be.  Whatever the reason, I know it wasn't the fried perch or the service.  A real shame and a real loss for Kamm's Corners.  I'm crossing my fingers and hoping the O' Malleys will open again soon.  When they do---I'm going to think positive---do yourself a favor and order their fried Lake Erie perch dinner.   Other restaurants can take all the components---from perch to mayo---and not come close.  We've sampled dozens of spots over the years, and never found one better than Red Lantern.

.             LUSCIOUS LAKE ERIE PERCH
To the tune of ""California Girls"" by the Beach Boys

      Well, East Coast states have oysters,
      A mere dozen just won't do.
      And Louisiana has those tender shrimp---
      For them all, a seafood coup.

      The King Crab rules Alaska,
      And their salmon is the best,
      While the lobster reigns off those Boston shores,
      It's with clams, New England's blessed.

      The West Coast has their tuna,
      In the Keys, stone crab's their pride,
      And those mahi-mahi swimming round Hawaii,
      But for fresh, you must reside.

          I wish they all could taste what we have here,
          I wish they all could taste what we have here,
          I wish they all could taste our Lake Erie Perch.

      I've been all around tasting seafood,
      But for me, just can't compare,
      Ohio's sweet luscious flaky Lake Erie Perch
      Next to anything, anywhere.

.
The last 2 visits here were both FABULOUS 5 stars.  Have yet to try other menu items and unlikely that we will, since the FRIED LAKE ERIE PERCH is perfect.  The entire spread that Red Lantern at Kamm's Corners serves up---from perch to fries to coleslaw to tartar sauce---has earned MY personal Recognition of Excellence.  HeHe.

If you're looking for anything to adorn a human, a bed, a kitchen counter, a shelf, bathtub, tabletop, or even a TV tray, try this TJ Maxx.     

I'm not a regular, but for the past 15 or so years I've popped in every few months with either something specifically in mind, or just to see what might grab me.  If you're lucky like I've been, you'll leave with at least one great bargain in a single visit.  Being a now-you-see-it / now-you-don't, snooze-you lose, ever changing overstock / buyout concept, I've probably missed out on scads of incredible deals because of my infrequent stops.  You will, too.  So my suggestion is to stop in at least twice a day.  Maybe three.
 
Handbags, however, are my weakness.  I don't have a herd of them---more an   easily controlled bevy or squad.  If you like them, too (like Karyn C's 4 star), this is a destination to include in your travel plans.
    
What looks like close to a thousand (honestly !), they're jam-packed---but neatly and sensibly organized---into a corner near the entrance.  Countless style variations---in a number of materials---seem to fill almost every square foot of available display space.  Like a flourishing overgrown jungle, bags of every sort cover two walls, sit on tiered tables, and hang from large separate triple-rowed rectangular units with endcaps.  Each narrow aisle is like a gauntlet---but a friendly beckoning one---both sides overflowing in totebags, satchels, messengers, crossbodies, hoboes and any other version you can think of, and in nearly any color you can think of.  There's something here for everyone and for every taste---much like department stores.  And like them, too, you'll come across some real stinkers.       

Their vast selection runs from about $20 to $200, with most probably falling in the $30 to $50 range.  I prefer better-quality leather---simply-designed, well-made---and although I've never been the type to be lured like a lemming over that precipitous edge into the world of high-end designers, those Forbes-listers DO seem to have cornered the market on the best hides. 
 
On a recent hunt, my sights were again aimed for Big Game---and I ""bagged"" a winner.  My trophy was a plush and beautifully-constructed...I'll admit it...Ralph Lauren.  From a woven silken green cord looped through a metal gold ring on the bag, and secured by a dime-sized logo button, dangled Ralph's exclusive heavy card-stock RL label, imprinted $268.00   The mass-produced plain utilitarian discounted TJ Maxx tag?---$99.99.  Yay!   ""Better leather and better workmanship"" being a long-time favorite retail mantra, I have another sharp-looking Liz Claiborne that I bought here several years ago.  Probably less than $50 and used many MANY times, that ""old bag"" still looks like new.

I've made other recent purchases here that I was especially pleased with:
~ 100% cashmere scarf...heavier weight, extra long, about 8"" wide ...$20
~  adorable, well-made straw hats ...about $12-$18 
~  Liz Claiborne dress heels...pale pink and almost TOO cute ...about $60
~  8 fake green pears...super-realistic looking...love to decorate with fruit---
.   particularly ones that don't rot or draw flies ...$9 
Over the years, also exceptionally well-discounted:  crystal, sheets, pillow cases, towels, wash cloths, serving bowls, glasses, dinner plates, cups, saucers, and lots of other stuff

~ 
The employees here are always friendly, helpful, courteous, and have been able to answer every question I've ever asked them---even ones about Canadian geography, lesser-known Pop Art, and ancient Babylonian politics.    heehee

I have not had the chance, since just arriving back in Durham to try their whole menu, however as a wing guy I was impressed, the variety of sauces and the variation of heat level was above average for local pubs.

Daily free soup and great weekly specials will make this a regular stop for me. Live entertainment, friendly service and great food,makes this one of my Durham favs."

Although smaller than the Nee How Market down the street, I always preferred Columbia. They seem to be a bit cleaner, and the prices are cheaper. The ""gift"" part of their name consists of a small selection of dishware (sake sets, tea sets, etc.) and not much else (they have a showcase with decorative fans). I'd come here regularly to stock up on spicy ramen, rice mix, soup mix, and tea. :) My go-to Asian mini-market. They also seem to have a ton of Korean dramas on VHS available for rent (I've never looked into it, but they're all lined up on shelves behind the counter)."

I had a return which was past due i.e. It was past the 45 days limit. But I told the cashier that my doctor told me not to put on the sun glasses on my child as they didn't have UVA protection and baby's eyes obviously are very sensitive and need protection. Also told her that I didn't have a car to come sooner to bring the product. She was very understanding and called her manager to help. This is what the manager said ""I can do the return for you but it will be a gift card and you have to spend the money RIGHT NOW"". I asked ""why...I'm happy and grateful to get the store credit but I have to run home and feed my baby...I can't do this right now"". Her response, with blank damn face ""you have to spend it now"" me: ""why??? It's a store credit, you are keeping the money anyway!!! At the moment, I need to go! I have to feed my baby soon!!"". She said: ""I can't explain it but u have to spend it now"". ARE YOU F***ING SERIOUS?? You work in a store for babies and children and you have no empathy for my baby and my situation????? Anyway, I called my family asked my family to feed my baby something as I was late now, I spent the damn money and 50 more cents but will I ever go back to this store? NOPE!!! NEVER!! If this organization has no empathy and understanding for ""children"" then why will I go there again?? The funny thing is, if they gave me a store credit I would have gone there and spent a lot more money. But now, they can keep whatever money they made from me but they will never get any more business from me! And yes, I will put this review every where I can!"
y9-gplwx-d9g9G0XkA3Vfg,cJ8JMLDB83qDkc_nO0JqsA,"Yes, First Way is very pro life, anti living together before marriage, anti birth control , anti sex before marriage, etc. BUT they are funded by the Catholic church so that's expected. When I called for an ultrasound the lady said I had to come in for a pregnancy test first. She didn't tell me that I would be doing a 30 minute counseling session before I could even take the test. The counseling is awkward. I felt very judged, my boyfriend and I have been together 3 years and just bought a house. I was told that it's not healthy to live together,  and that I should sustain abstinence until marriage. Not happening lol. I wouldn't recommend going here if you are planning on having an abortion. They will try to convince you otherwise. 
Anywho. 
Everybody was very nice, I didn't like the girl who did my counseling though. When I came in for my ultrasound the tech did bring me inside before my boyfriend to talk about the importance of getting married. My boyfriend chose not to speak with a male counselor and they did try to convince him otherwise. It isn't required though ! 
The tech was very thorough , explained everything happening and pointed out all parts of the baby and placenta. And the pictures turned out amazing ! We got to see baby in 2d,3d and 4d. We got so many pictures to take home and got to pick out a hand knitted beanie before we left. They offer alot of free classes and free materials for baby and mama."
5RLTEUnkcbDuSk39RDkfog,AETmlP0qqpT2FEhPAOnrjw,"I purchased a groupon in January for laser removal.  I called many many times, voicemail was always full and no answer.  By March I contacted groupon and was told they would have the business contact me.  It is now May, I finally got in touch with them today, via TEXT.  Very unprofessional in my opinion.  I attempted to call in the middle of texting and they still refused to answer, they were obviously available to text.  I was told they had no record of me ever calling or texting in the last 5 months and it must have been a ""connection error"".  I am amazed that they were able to pull phone records and scan the last 5 months in a 10 minute period (obvious lie).  They then told me they were also never contacted by groupon and that they contacted their groupon rep and my name was not entered in their system at all.  This happened in another 5 minutes, not enough time to call a rep, pull records, and verify (obvious lie #2).  Also find it extremely odd that their would be a connection error and a groupon error.  That is conveniently a lot of errors.  Very, very unprofessional.  I did also ask via text if we could speak over the phone rather than texting to do bookings and was told ""this is how they do it at the biggest spa back east"".  I imagine that any business that works through text does not do it as the ONLY means of communication.  If you bought a groupon try to get a refund!  If somebody runs a business this poorly, they should not be doing any type of medical procedures on your body!"

His appts were scheduled literally in 5 minute intervals (I overheard another patient check in for her appt after mine). I would time my appts and they lasted for 3 mins max after making a 2 1/2 hr drive to see him. He would take calls in the middle of the appts and wouldn't  listen to any concerns. After telling him of heart palpitations, he told me it's not a big deal and wouldn't do further testing. He seemed little informed of the condition I have, and seemed even less interested in actually finding a remedy as if it was an inconvenience. Also, after telling him I could no longer drive due to syncopal episodes while driving, he told me he didn't see an issue with me continuing to drive...yah, makes sense.

Q8-OGdUV2T_AUXNou14Grg,FreX8IbF9lWsd2xxfXIVWg,"I highly do not recommend Dr. White for multiple reasons:
1) she purposely books multiple patients at the same time, so she is literally jumping from Exam room to Exam room, rather than sincerely sitting 1 on 1 with each patients.
2) ANY TIME you call the office you are placed on hold for at least 5 minutes. Always.
3) she refuses to give any kind of minimal results over the phone, so you have to come back in and pay another copay for her to run into your room for 20 seconds to give your results as she runs to the next room and patient. You are JUST MONEY IN HER POCKET. You are not treated as a patient with care, sincerity and time. 
4) she sent me to numerous (serious) tests and when she saw me at my physical about 6 months later she had totally forgot about it all! She doesn't even review your chart and history before seeing you!
3) took her and her staff 2.5 weeks to send my records to my new physician. They refused to mail them (even though it's a HIPPA violation to fax or email medical info) and kept faxing the records to a phone number. Not a fax number.
Overall, her practice is a joke. DO NOT go to her. There are plenty of great physicians in the metro Phoenix area!"

Finally the other day we managed to remember we wanted to try it. 

It was decent. We both got the fried fish with fries and mac and cheese. It was more expensive than I'd thought it would be, $10 for the entree without a soda. The servings were huge though so that made up for the price, personally I'd rather have had a bit less food at a cheaper price since it was far too much for either of us to finish. The fries were pretty tasty, the mac and cheese was very bland. The fish itself tasted good but they put too much seasoning on the outside and in their batter for my tastes. My husband thought the seasoning was pretty good. The tartar sauce tasted more like coleslaw to me, and I hate coleslaw!

All in all I'd say it's worth a try."

They picked up the tractor I was told to keep my key, as they had them at the shop and driver had one with him. I got charged $115.00 to ""diagnose"" why my tractor would not start. Nobody at the shop, nor the driver knew about the safety lockout switch Kubota has on their tractors. IT WAS A FACTORY ITEM ON THEM. They hotwired my tractor every time they needed to move it. I wasn't notified after 2 weeks of any problems, the office girl had the wrong e-mail account, sent out an e-mail, and when I didn't respond back they just left it sit. They never tried to call me.

I had just put 2 brand new lights on the rear, factory bulbs and housings. One was out, told them to replace the bulb, and they wanted $143.75 plus $77.8 for labor to fix it. I refused to pay it and they did credit the bill.

They told me the clutch had no free play and needed adjusting for $115.00 dollars. It had just been in to their shop in Deer Valley for complete rear end repair, having gotten dirt into the rear case, all new seals, pump, bearings everything.... I had put 8 hours on the tractor since then. Plus, it is an automatic!

They wanted $61.36 dollars to drain water and put a new fuel filter in..... takes 10 minutes at best to do it.

I was told my tie rods were loose....$787.38 to repair, (Labor alone was to be $345.00)

I also had to pay for freight, they run on negative inventory so the customer gets to pay for them not stocking parts.

The girl in the office told me I should expect these repairs on an old tractor..... folks, it only has 650 hours on it! Really......!

It would stay open till 8PM during week days and open on weekends as well. You can purchase 50-hour full-time package or 30-hour part-time package, and they would charge you based by the hours your kid stays there. For any unused hours during week days, you can use them during weekends for errands or shoppings in nearby malls. 
All the teachers are loving and sincerely care about my son. They arranged all sorts of activities during the day so the kids can learn and grow. My son always said that he had so much fun at Gloworm and made friends with kids of all ages because they have group session with everybody participating! 
We also send our 9-year old son during summer and he enjoys Gloworm as well much to our surprise. He would draw, cook, play sports and games during his stay there, and he loves the teachers and facilities there as well. 
One thing I really like Gloworm is that they will send multiple photos and videos everyday through Tadpoles and emails so I can see my kids grow and have fun everyday while I am away. Lots of great memories captured! 
I would highly recommend any parents who want flexibility in their schedule and love environment for their kids. They will have great fun and experience there!"

I was offered bar snacks with my wine (yay!) while I played poker. With the price of drinks at the Palazzo, having a small snack with your drink is a nice perk.

KtrPzjAin1w1ASrp-sUSIQ,Ry1O_KXZHGRI8g5zBR3IcQ,"Who would have thought a hospital would be the last place I would have imagined a ""fast food"" eatery would open up business in.  I guess there are worse choices, but it really helps with convenience if you are picking someone up from the hospital and that person is starving.  Just another option - I'm sure the CMC cafeteria is great - but it seems like a lot of the people that work at CMC frequent this spot.  Located on my Mezzanine level (between the 1st and 2nd floors) of the Medical Center Plaza.  Now be careful!  There are multiple medical plazas concentrated in this one area, but luckily there is only one Chick-fil-A in the hospital. 

Since the Chick-fil-A is ""between floors""  there are low ceilings... no windows, with exception to some windows that look out into the hallway that people pass through.  There are a bunch of tables and a few booths, but mostly people just carry out.

The line seems to form fairly quickly, but the staff is super friendly.  They ran out of lemonade when we ordered so they had to make a new batch.  It wasn't a long wait, but the manager apologized - no harm done.  Despite the line, people were waiting... so I guess that means people really want their Chick-fil-A when they want it!

There is also a Starbucks in the hospital, but I could not tell you where I saw it if my life depended on it.  I was running to make an appointment and I went through 3 or 4 different sky-ways and elevators... luckily I was early so I made it right on time."

DaXZ_HiJNjWWZ9hbBy73CA,lOccDkiDxktnWRcSN7CKMg,"I'm definitely what you would consider an occasional golfer, and do so for fun, I'm not great but have the occasional par.  Just found this course a couple weeks ago and it's been lots of fun. It's a very basic 9 hole course, with two par 4 and 7 par 3's. It's definitely a walkable course but I opt for the 6 dollar cart Cus.. Well.. It's fun. 

The course itself is in decent shape. The tee boxes could use some work, and it would be nice if the holes were numbered.  Also some tee markers are missing. There is a few ponds of water which keeps it a little interesting, but you won't run into any trees out here as it was built in an corn field. 

The driving range is pretty basic, and hits into hole 6, which is a little scary since lots of people get their drivers out and I've seen a few range balls on that hole while we golf. I think they could use a net or something across to protect the golfers just in case. The driving range is also  heated in the winter, but I haven't used it. 

They also have a grill and patio furniture outside, im assuming so you could have a party or outing there. Overall, a pretty relaxed atmosphere for beginners to practice their game.  

Staff is very friendly And helpful each time I'm there."

Came back the next day for a late breakfast. The seating is super comfortable and ordering was easy. Crepes came out fast!

We ordered egg and cheese crepes, mine included turkey in it. They were larger than expected and they tasted great!  Excellent savory crepes. The butter brown sugar crepe was a little disappointing. It lacked flavor overall and was a little overdone. 

Highly recommend this place for delicious savory crepes."

My AC went out, of course June in Arizona. 
Backstory: Awhile back during a regular inspection I was given a hefty quote for the millions of dollars it was going to take to fix all these ""issues"" with my unit (mind you not that old of a unit either) from ""the other guys"".. 
So needless to say I was slacking and expected the worst when it went out. These guys were the quickest to respond and with courtesy. Chris came out and had us up in running in just a few hours. Not only were they quick but honest, I showed him the quote I received from ""the other guys"", he felt that was inflated considering the simple fix it took. He saved me over $600, that's thanks enough. 
He cleaned my unit or flushed it, whatever that's called, he left no mess, he was so polite and super friendly. I would call him any day, any time and wait if I had to instead of dealing with ""the others"".  You're a life saver Air conditioning & Refrigeration."

When it's that time,there are 3 Houses I look to.
Hugo Boss
St.John
Ralph Lauren
Had never been in the Lauren store at Biltmore and decided to give it a whirl.
It was Sunday afternoon last week and it wasn't busy.Wasn't empty either,but not only was I not greeted by the 2 sales women at the front of the shop,in fact they both turned away from me!
As I meandered, I did see a skirt on a manniquen that I liked and wanted to try with a summer white crisp jacket also displayed on a different manniquen.
I passed by a few more salespeople who when I got near,managed to turn their backs to me or to quickly engage someone else in conversation.
Hell,I would have been happy if a security guard started paying attention to me..
I couldn't find the skirt or jacket anywhere on the racks,and went to seek out the help of the sales staff.
I walked back up to the front of the shop where the skirt was on the manniquen,in the hopes of purchasing it.You would think at this point someone would ask if they could help me.I was obviously looking for something and someone who could assist.
One of the women who turned her back to me when I walked in,saw me,I smiled,made eye contact and a bee line to her.
I started to say ""Hello"" and she again turned her back and simply walked to the back of the store!
I was a bit stunned.At first I figured I'd follow behind asking if she could help me forcing her to just deal,but I decided to not further embarrass myself.
Kind of a shame as I did want the jacket and skirt,the paring being around 700.00...
I walked over to Macy's,where they did try to assist,but only carry the casual sportswear line of Lauren,and informed me that what I was looking at could only be bought from a Lauren store.
I guess I saved some money that day,but still,it was a pretty shitty way to outright profile what you think can't afford to shop in your store...."

We hired another builder to update our pool and Prado & Sons were the sub-contractors. Normally we wouldn't even know who the subs were but we had some issues with our pool. The first time around we had some blotchy white stains and small concrete pebbles that didn't mix well with the Pebble-Tec. After some serious discussions with our remodeler, Prado & Sons, and the Pebble-Tec Company based here in Scottsdale, we had a do-over. Customer service this second time around could not have been better. Lots of information, calls on time, service when they said they'd be here, and a pool that is as beautiful as can be.

Z7lRCPa9MPwFRg18DaOXlg,vtsRy9LmwJiTYb8AMtoFcw,"The people in charge of this beautiful venue are rude, irresponsible, unprofessional, and almost ruined my wedding day.

My husband met with Cindy, the woman who was in charge of the facility, two times before the wedding to plan things out and we paid in full at the church, via personal check, months in advance. 

The day of the wedding Cindy stood us up and we were locked out.  She didn't answer any of our calls and it looked like we were going to have to get married in the cemetery outside!   

While our families waited outside in the 90+ degree heat, my husband drove to the church, tracked down a janitor, and begged him to come back and let us in. 

The ceremony was delayed 30 minutes and everyone was sweaty for pictures. 

After the ceremony the janitor chased my husband and I down in the middle of pictures because Cindy had the nerve to call the janitor's phone, ask for my husband, then scream at him for not going through her.  (Mind you, she stood us up on the big day and didn't answer our calls.)  She actually claimed she didn't know who we were and we had no business being there!  I contacted the church to report what happened while we were in the limo and they never got back to me. It was the worst experience.  

We moved to the area before we got married and were planning on joining Morning Star Lutheran Church, but after this experience I will never go back.  I can't believe they didn't have the courtesy to respond to our email and apologize.  Some places are really in it for the money and nothing more."

They send several email reminders about your appointment to assure you wont forget. I didn't mind this and actually appreciated it. 

Once we arrived, they were just as pleasant in person as they were over the phone. Overall, their service is great. The people were nice and we had very minimal wait time.

When you go to the back, the exam areas are open. They are simply separated by cabinets. Your exam area is semi-private depending on which location you get. People walking pass and you out in the open for everyone to see. There are no TV's or monitors in each exam area either. So idle time while they work in your mouth is definitely boring. And unlike our other dentist - they didn't have the fancy massage chairs. I'm picking here - I get it. But I have quickly learned that these extra things matter.

Our visit went super smooth. My son felt relaxed with the Dentist. But we only went for a brief exam and x-rays. So we were literally in and out within 15 minutes. Crazy fast. 

Our second visit, started off great. We arrived and they got us in super fast again. They got my son comfortable and were preparing him for his procedure but they pulled out the needle and well he just freaked out. I mean he didn't go crazy but once they stuck in the needle in and poked him, he was having a difficult time keeping his mouth open. I don't believe it helped that they didn't have the right size mouth bite piece either. So I tried to talk to him and get him to behave and open his mouth but the dentist just stopped and said no, he had to go somewhere else. 

I get it - they are not a pediatric dentist. But they were considered because they are supposed to be a family dentist. They recommended us to a pediatric dentist. But after that  - I felt some kind of way. The dentist was annoyed and you could tell. Her and her assistant hurried us out of there. Instead of asking me about a preferred area or whatever - they just gave me a list and shunned me out. Because they refused to work on my son, I would think that they would have canceled any future appointments. But they did not. It was a good thing I called to check because I would have hate to have been billed for a no-show. 

In the end - I still would recommend this place - just not for your kids. And I will take my son back to our regular dentist. We were just trying to find another dentist for a certain procedure. Our regular dentist is not listed as a pediatric dentist either but she works with my son, and they don't use needles on the kids. They have this awesome machine that is perfect for numbing people without having to use needles. 

My man actually has his appointment here in the next two weeks so I am sure he will have a better experience. Maybe it's my fault for having a son scared of needles but I wish I wouldn't have felt so horrible after that experience."

The only differences between the places are how much seating do they have and can you even find one?  This location is a bit smaller than the other ones that I frequent; so the seating is at a premium.  
When the whole scene started, I used to use it as my road warrior offices across town.  Now that it's more than totally mainstream, you can't really work there and enjoy a great cup of latte.  The great cup is still there, but the joy of sitting and sipping a cup'a'java has long parted.
I also noticed, that they have now advanced to a full grind and serve espresso units at the stores.  I remember the day that they use to grind each serving, tamp it, and wrestle with the machine to deliver the perfect pull.  Oh well progress.
If you happen to be coming through here, there is plenty of parking.  If you want to park in the small lot in front of the store, be careful...you need to pull in near the McD's drive through area and it can be rather congested.

And they took a grinder to the crank shaft counter weights and grinded the crap out of them to ""balance"" it. 

The owner is cranky and rude and says if his shop breaks it, its not his fault and won't take responsibility for any parts that are broken. Anything you say, he says is the wrong way and there is only one way to do things and its his way.

hI8ZPCBZeyvGNEdO1onG8Q,XCGk-3l5zoq9bSBZohVqoA,"My dog got fractured toe 

I initially heard about them through another person at the dog park and then took my two jack Russells to them. They agreed to give me a deal since I had two dogs and that I travel frequently because of my work. Over the different times they had my dogs they never had any concern in any regard about my dogs. I liked them personally and the fact that they were open to raw diet for dogs. However the last time she said that they have been busy and need to raise the price just before dropping them off. I said we can talk about it aftwards since for this time we agreed on the usual price. After I picked them up,  she said she won't be able to have my dogs due to them barking which she has never mentioned before. And right after I bring my dog home I notice that she is limping I contacted her right away asking if anything happened while they were there and she said no following with mentioning their policy. I took my puppy to vet and found out her toe is broken. Not that they didn't take responsibility for that his husband called me a challenging client and that somehow I forced them to agree with the deal they were giving me which was not true and so irrelevant to the issue that was happening. 
I am glad their business is doing good but as I told them the only reason someone's pet service business can get better is due to a good service and clients refferal which I even referred them to others myself. But to maintain the good service you should accept enough clients that you can give proper care and service to. I was not at her place to be able to say what exactly happened but my dog was fine when she went there and she ended up with broken toe after I picked her up. 
This is simply a poor service and the way they went about it was very very disappointing.
From the way they have been responding they will not take responsibility for it or cover the costs. I will manage to cover the costs and she will be fine eventually but I don't know how they will deal with their conscious knowing this happened there under their supervision due to whatever factor it was. The sad part is that she keeps saying she didn't see anything or notice anything or didn't even see she was limping. The fact that she was too busy perhaps that couldn't even notice the limping worries me.
I will defiantly not take my dogs there and would not recommend their services to anyone."

I don't get my nails done often but she seemed very professional and knew what she was doing. I wanted to give 3 stars because my thumb nail was not filed evenly and I was not asked if I wanted to get gel polish even though it was an extra charge. She picked the color for me without telling me it was gel. I gave 4 stars because before I left the owner examined my nails and since they weren't perfect she gave me $15 off for next time. Overall, I'm happy with my nails."

jqcnwuhyzgL4kSVxVeJgzQ,z6VZrWNIAVw8Nv1w065tLg,"I really hoped that things with Big 4 will improve over time, but they didn't. Now, warranty period over, I think it's time to check the balance.

Salesman was amazing - friendly, funny, giving good advice. Truly a reason to prefer Big 4 over the competition. Pity he deflated quickly after the troubles began.

Unfortunately, the sale itself was not as smooth - got my car delivered with a dent on the hood. Had to drive away immediately, but got a senior manager reassuring that it will be fixed, no worries.

It wasn't. Our salesman went dull and said there is a process to follow, time to wait, etc. At the end, the dent remained. 

Further on I've discovered that sales feature list was mismatching actual vehicle features (e.g.: fuel capacity promised 120, actual 90). Tried twice to get the revised list printed, did not happen - ""printer off-line"", ""can't print landscape, list truncated"", etc.

Service was oriented towards being as frequent and expensive as possible, with messy structure of ""service contracts"". Yet missing obvious problems - got one pinched tire rotated twice before they finally recognized the problem and fixed it.

Was charged for a key fob battery though still on warranty - some funky procedural hiccup, but money back never happened. Got charged extra $$$ for flushing the windshield fluid ""your windshield cracked because of that!"" (really? I thought that was because of lose gravel flying everywhere...)

Once mechanic forgot to fully insert the oil stick, left it dangling under the hood, mud getting into the tube. Another time got oil change indicator not reset, and then have it off again way before next change was due. Was told my driving made the just replaced oil in a new engine burn in just 3000 km. Etc., etc., etc. 

In short, lots if BS and extra money wasted. Though customer service reps were usually very nice, and shuttle service super helpful. 

I even was on the phone with Chrysler folks, and they were awesome too - but no help with my troubles. 

So overall, never again. Neither Chrysler, nor Big 4. Thanks. 

In my mind, compared them to Renault I use to deal with for years - my gosh, no comparison! Europeans were impossibly better in any aspect."

The rooms are nice and well kept, and we were given plenty of towels and shampoo/lotion/etc. We only stayed here for a night, and it wasn't too memorable as were pretty much just came here to pass out, only to wake up a few hours later, but I do remember it being a very nice place to stay.

Why aren't there any locations in CenPho? Who knows. But I can tell you a couple of things. SRP's customer service was exceptionally helpful! Thanks, Becky, for walking me through setting up a temporary emergency power short cut, and getting me easy driving directions to the pay center. And this pay center seems to get quite a bit of activity, as evidenced by the customers there when I arrived in the middle of the night, and the vehicles arriving after I left. I was able to get power restored by 1 a.m. The rest of the night was a blur, but that has nothing to do with my electricity adventure.

You don't need a deposit to stay here. You don't even need identification to stay here. They merely will accept cash with no questions asked. 
 
The room I was put in had those awful German Cockroaches. German cockroaches are those nasty little things that can endure the most powerful poisons and multiply into the thousands within hours. There were so many cockroaches that you couldn't see the walls. 
There was blood stains all over the carpet, and under the bed we found a tooth that still had the root and pieces of the gum on it. 
The bathroom looked and smelled like a restroom at a truck stop on a rural highway in Texas. 

Even around midnight, the neighbors would knock on our door and ask us for cigarettes or spare change. 
Many of the neighbors were skinheads and white supremacists who were very vocal on expressing their political agenda. 
I believe one of the neighbors was an escort. There were dozens of lowlife looking men coming in and out of her room, and every time I would walk down the walkway she would poke her face out a little bit to see if I was a client. 

The security guards are two mean spirited degenerated Latino kids who are cruel for no reason. I witnessed them verbally and physically attack many residents for no reason. A preteen was  minding his own business while listening to his ipod, and the security guards shouted a homophobic insult to him. An elderly black man was sitting in his car and talking on his cellphone, and they went up to his window and threatened to beat him up. One night I called security because there was a man who had physically passed out near my front door and didn't appear to be moving at all. I had to call security 4 times before they showed up. When they showed up, they smelled like weed and liquor and were almost incoherent. 

The cops came every single night. When you got skinheads and minorities living together in the same complex, you are gonna get a motherfucking disaster. 

It was obvious that they gave me this room: http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/jul/06/body-found-siegel-suites-boulder-highway/ because there were bullet holes in the ceiling. If these guys are gonna rent out the room again, at least have the motherfucking decency to cleanup the human remains!

I filed a complaint against Siegel Suites to the health department, but Clark County is a joke when it comes to these procedures. 
I regret not taking them to small claims court, but I bet they wouldn't have shown up or even paid up.

I would be more than happy to testify in court against the owners of this establishment."

They have a wide price range so you can usually find something nice in your own budget.  I personally love the Twik line, as it is affordable and fashionable.

This place is bigger than it looks! LOTS of gift items, lots of cute items. Everything is reasonably priced (nothing overly expensive. I LOVE it). For example:
- cute beer opener $5
- beautiful umbrellas for less than $50
- cups and mugs at average $10
- saw cute placemats for $12 each (affordable, yes I think so!!)
- there are cute lip balms for $3
- jar o' hibiscus!!! Big jar for $40? I forgot... but the mini (jam-size jar) is $12 I think
- gift baskets at all price ranges

My prices may be a bit incorrect +/- $1 

They are cheap enough that if I were to shop for my house (that I do not currently have), I can actually afford these items! I hate visiting decor stores to see items that only the snobby, rich people can afford.

I expected this shop to be FULL of candles or scented items (I'm not into these), and yes they do have lots of these. But they have lots of EVERYTHING too:
- bar essentials
- bar, miscellaneous -vase to hold wine corks, layered cocktails maker, super funky napkins!!
- spices, jam, recipe books, hot sauce!
- TOAD HOUSE (a house for toads!!!!)
- unique bowls for dips
- a beautiful jewellery wall organizer for $150
- magnetic cheese utensils holder (your butter knife, cheese knife, etc. are attached to this magnetic wooden block. So fun!)

They did the photography for Shenker and I ordered prints, a clock and a HD panel. The HD panel was gorgeous, the clock was the CHEAPEST piece of garbage I have ever seen. The clock came unassembled, the pieces (I know from my travels) obviously were made in China specials. the clock itself had a battery in the back and a hole in front you had to assemble and it was not even tight, it was with bent metal that composed the components to the clock it was just awful. 

Not wanting to write a reviewI spoke with Belle and explained it. She asked me to leave it at Shenker and I did, when she did not fix it, and it is a gift to my father with cancer, I called again and asked that she let me know when I can get it as my son no longer was going to Shenker. She again asked me to pick it up there. 

Speaking to her she said that she would be at her office and I should come by and she would give me a photo and a mug for compensation, and I told her it was not necessary. She insisted, I thought it was a nice gesture. Two weeks later we still have nothing, I call her and tell her I am leaving to see my father, where are the products. She says, ""OH I AM ON MY WAY NOW"". My receptionist said it looked like something you get at a 99Cent store (the mug) and there was no other photo or anything to compensate for the piece if trash they were selling as a photo clock. After arguing with her telling her how very much I did not want to write a bad review and hearing her husband (I suspect) advising her in the background, I just gave up. She showed no desire to do anything but say it was a misunderstanding and she did what she said. Funny but this is weeks after she was supposed to have done it even if it were what she said.

9pmkEITiV92iaqWDeWQSfg,pHWa6Dx88-MaoVClBB-OVQ,"Michelle did a great job for us.

Our situation was a little complex. She was the agent for both the sale of our home and the purchase of our next one. She did a great job staging our home and taking pictures. Interest was very strong in our home and we sold within 3 weeks of going to market. 

Then we were working with a very accelerated timeline, as my wife and I needed to find a new home within a couple weeks in order to close on time. The first great thing about Michelle was, she knew what we wanted. So, when she sent us listings to check out, they all fit what we were looking for, in our price range, etc. That made the search much easier. Two, my wife and I are thorough, so we like to see a lot of houses before making a decision. We looked at probably 40 homes, and Michelle went with us on every trip. She also gets bonus points as one weekend, it was over 120 degrees both days and she was with us all day looking at homes.

Lastly, she has a great temperament for the business. Our purchase was complicated as it involved several different facets. Inevitably, there was also some conflict between buyer and seller with regard to repairs, etc. She navigated working through all of the complexities, always keeping a very even keel, which was very important as our stress level was through the roof. 

The end result is that my wife and I found a home we love in a great neighborhood, exactly what we were looking for. We sold our house for the price range we wanted. Michelle is experienced, professional, knowledgeable, persistent, and just very pleasant to deal with."

The clinic is very nice, the staff were great, and the appointment was super punctual. I spoke with Dr. Seto at length about vaccination, the various pathogens and their varying geographies and Dr. Seto was extremely knowledgeable throughout our conversation. His calming touch with my stressed out dog was also greatly appreciated. I really appreciated the fact that he did not try to talk me into any extra services or medications that my dog does not actually need. As one does not generally go for a second veterinary opinion feeling confident in the quality, care, and character of your pet's Vet goes a long way.

5QNoAr8OJhOWTPX2h-00jQ,_05-amFJjD5gwmaq3SjeNw,David is an outstanding attorney that truly cares about his clients.  I have talked to him about several cases and his compassion for his clients certainly shines through.  I cannot think of a better attorney to entrust with my case if I needed help in this area.

hvg7IU87Dn3Y1RRZc1FsLw,XNSyl47aXuPsvC5zXm5uhw,"I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!"
iiUu1e8FNkfoSBA9JomqdQ,_h4UlHXy5pTJpetOl6tWxA,"Ive been eating this pizza most of my life, but never really had a ""fresh"" pie, just re heated slices while i was out shopping or something. I kept it simple with a large plain and an order of wings. First thing i noticed was the cheese was lacking, even on a light sauce request. Though its a good blend, i feel it could be a bit better and a bit more. Sauce is nice. But for me , it's all about that crust! Very nice, the way it soaks up the oil. The wings were pretty big and meaty, but they should double the cook time, i dont mind the wait. Overall i always enjoyed this place, usually friendly staff and quick service"

L9OPgTCMY_LYbndR4CHvXg,W53xS6WPFyb0Db2S8B8n4A,"I give 1 review because the cashier was totally rude. It looked like she hated her job and when I asked her about a few items behind her counter she seemed so inpatient. When I was paying with my card I was about to slide it through the card machine and said ""wait!"" I waited and held my card out and she kept repeating herself even when I wasn't even doing anything but waiting. She started talking under her breathe and I thought she was just overall rude. Please tell associate: 10344 to smile a little also."
6Xr3eg6VyGJCvE22ttnKsA,AtSSUbr2ENfFa6IkeKm_4A,"I guess the best way to describe this place is a bakery/cafe/cafeteria.  You can buy products to take away or stay for breakfast, lunch or just a coffee and sticky bun.  It was a mixed experience for us.  As a bakery, the bread was fresh and tasty.   We bought a baguette for dinner that evening and were not disappointed.   As a cafeteria, the service was friendly.  The decor is basic, with about a dozen or so tables.  We had stopped for lunch.  We had what they called their ""boite a lunch"".    I started with the roasted tomato soup and it was excellent.  My wife had the salad, but was not impressed by the dressing and thought it all looked a bit limp.  The next course was a quiche or a mille-feuilles.  I had their mushroom offering, my wife had roasted veggies.  They grill the pieces in a panini grill.  When we arrived at our table, it was obvious that the mille-feuilles had been sitting in the counter for more than a day.  Heating them up simply turned the pastry into a warm soggy envelope for the stuffing.  The dessert was a tiny piece of left over pumpkin pie from another day.

Now, the boite a lunch special costs $8.95, so I guess you get what you pay for.  The only thing that was good was the soup, which seemed to have been made the same day."
hvg7IU87Dn3Y1RRZc1FsLw,-RhRXVW9z9fs5zzxhFfnHg,"Finally got the chance to hit up AZ Cheesecake Co at the Farmers Market on Saturday.  I'm sorry to say but the key lime cheesecake just didn't move me.  I found it to be bitter and lacking any creaminess.  It wasn't bad but it just wasn't the flavor that I was hoping for when I picked it up.  The wife never shared her Peanut Butter one so I'll just have to go back and try something else.  

All of that being said, he always has a ton of different flavors and I'd reccomend following him on Twitter to see what he is bringing to the market each week.  Chandler is too far for me but I love that he brings the goods to me.  I'm pretty sure he delivers too so you really can't go wrong."
fQv_HqZHVlLuRe7ypbg1eQ,kd0t_9hFm8T6MGH6zBjG5g,"I would say about 10% of your response is accurate. I never once yelled at or berated the person who answered the phone. Four days in a row I called and left messages with her for Kirk to call me back. Not once did I receive a call back until after I gave up on your (lack of) service. Telling the person on the telephone I will be writing reviews to warn potential clients of your lack of professionalism is not a threat, juvenile, or combative. It's strictly warning the public about a company that can not be trusted. You can dispute as much as you would like but I was patient and considerate considering your lack of professionalism. Your overall ratings speak for themselves and you always appear to have a clever response to people disappointed in your company. Maybe it's time to take responsibility for your customer service and stop pointing the finger at paying customers."
io4Wup6V-L_RJpwdOoAaOg,gxRw9c2lvijXBNhKU5i7_g,"Love it.  When I walked in, someone said ""hello!"" and wasn't even fake about it.  Then when I checked out, the same someone actually conversed with me about my book, which, when I asked someone for help finding, I got help finding with NO ATTITUDE.

The selection was a little tiny bit weaker than at a chain (they actually didn't have what I wanted, even though what I wanted was a pretty popular normal not weird book by michael chrichton), but they had the basics and I would bet a million dollars they would take special orders with a smile."
uZpt2ft8IsG-fAyFWhNChA,YV8JhYGuyPkaLDHIY1C1rg,"I was traveling on a road trip and discovered I needed some fluids topped off and that I had some ""other"" engine needs to be attended to.  I was at a gas station on a major road through Boulder City.... and I felt that I needed someone to look at stuff before I headed through the desert.  I asked the guy at the pump next to mine and he said ""follow me"".  He took me to K&C auto, only a few blocks away.  There were a couple of guys chatting and having a cup of morning coffee when we pulled up.  He explained my situation and asked if I could ""leave me car""... um... no.  I explained further.  I very nice gentleman proceeded to open the hood of my car and shake his head and smile.  He immediately realized that I was a female, unknowledgeble of car stuff.  We got into a very good conversation  and before I knew it he had topped off all my fluids, filled my tires with air, cleaned my battery posts, checked and filed my oil, explained the extra hose that lead to no-where really was ok and most importantly told me what work needed to be done soon and what I needed to do at my next maintenance....
When it was all said and done he said ""ok, you're all done!""   I asked what my damaged would be and he said ""nothing"".  I was floored.  NO KIDDING!   Wow!  He could have really charged me a ton.  I was mentally prepared for the ""raping"" that could have occured. (ok, bad word).   
Anyways,  I was so thrilled, I gave him a hug and spilled his cup of hot coffee all over my feet.  DAMN!  I felt so bad.  I offered to buy him a cup of joe but apparently he had a full pot in the office and did NOT want whatever I would have been able to come up with.  
What a great guy!   Believe me.... if and when I ever get near there, I will look him up.  
I plan to send him a box of 'goodies""  (homemade expresso brownies!)

If the world was filled with more good samaritans (a.k.a. guardian angel) we'd all be better off.   

Thank you.  For being you."

MsN-a-JaOpHszGqMb-D-Iw,zc0K1rGDQwdfYhK2ArCVOA,"We got into the club without paying a cover. The bar was open for ladies all they had to do was tip the bar tender. My girlfriend got herself a drink and I tipped the bar tender. She occasionally would let me take a sip of it until, one the bouncers came up to my face and started yelling about it making huge deal about her sharing her drink. The club itself seemed pretty dead, there was little to no one there. The music played by the dj was average at best. There's nothing special about this place better off finding somewhere else that actually has a live party scene instead of 13 people standing around drinking."
QpBTAeC4zJzxyUbNwBuoVA,f8CQSwwUqvmkl_sbG1qJ2A,"Atrocious!
One of the worst groupon deals I ever brought. Denis - (the menace) is unprofessional to the core and impossible to ever get them on the phone. A painfully sought appointment resulted in me getting bumped off becasue he had another appointment o keep!!

He openly suggested that I should contact groupon to get a refund! Jerks and jokers like these should never advertise their firms on groupon.

Stay away!!!!!"
QpQOnmRwCny0gzPlomaGJg,3e3AFfXbjjq36FZytm8d0Q,SUPER unprofessional and they do NOT return your calls or messages. I originally purchased a Groupon for them but I refunded because I was so upset with their service!! Do yourself a favour and don't waste your time with them!!!

EEAtafGPtPhwERoM3onXuw,9olpPYmaiCqIgOyLrmT24g,"I love me some classic American Chinese food. You know what I mean, greasy and sweet and fried and just all around delicious. Panda Chinese Kitchen is a talented purveyor of this lauded cuisine.

There are a few mainstays I always stick to when getting their takeout. General Tso's Chicken which is of course tangy/sweet, boneless BBQ spareribs that are almost never dry and wonton soup. Egg rolls too, but they can be a bit mushy on occasion. Their broccoli in brown sauce is also solid.

All in all, this place is cheap and fast and hardly a letdown. I will certainly keep going back and can confidently recommend."
kcoz23DLEYM0iI6BR7STkA,bYgBglTb3Q76BwxGTDGIQw,"Less than a week before we were to move back to Pittsburgh my husband broke his dentures for the 5 time in less than 5 years and we decided to just get new ones because I didn't have time to take them to the doctor in South Carolina who made them, and obviously did a horrible job. I called Aspen Dental from South Carolina, explained the situation to them and scheduled an appointment for the Friday after we arrived. Once we got to Pittsburgh, I discovered my 81 year old father (who is blind and has dementia) was in dire need of new dentures also, so I called and schedule him an appointment also.

For the next two weeks I was in their office every day, one day for my husband the next for my father as they both went through the steps of getting new dentures. 

The staff was absolutely amazing, they understood the special needs of helping with my father (and my 78 year old mother on oxygen that came along for each appointment) and helped me keep straight who was coming on what day for what procedure. 

I can not say enough about how wonderful everyone in this office is. They were very attentive, compassionate, friendly, and never did we have to wait for anything, you're in you're out! They are my new dental choice!"

wPubQF6mNW8fNGpDpkebrQ,oF_vwmhGi-JechfnimM60Q,"This bookstore was a welcome addition to Medina Square since the former bookstore on the square long since closed down and Border's went out of business. The bookshop is much larger than it appears from the outside and features many large tables with featured books which is great for browsing. As the namesake suggests, they also do have a number of handmade goods and gift type items, which is nice if you're doing some holiday shopping on the square or need to pick up a thoughtful gift. I'm always a bit sticker shocked when I come here as they don't offer much in the way of discounts, but such is the way for independently owned bookstores. I usually try to pick up at least one book to support this local business, but I'll admit it's not my go to for book shopping. I would say I recommend stopping in here if you like supporting independent book stores or you are looking for a thoughtful gift."

They literally picked up our loved one when we explicitly told them not to and then tried charging us for their mistake to a tune of double what the other crematorium was going to charge for the entire service. How they spoke to me on the phone was mind blowing! Heartless! I was in total shock! Afterwards I heard from multiple sources that this is their standard operation.

JQiUQiojYfRlEPT1JzfnwQ,-MshojFMU-M1bWbA9j3YtA,"I've been living in one of their properties out of necessity due to the cheap rent while being enrolled in medical school. As I look to graduate next month, I find it pertinent to advise anyone that might look into renting one of their properties to be advised. 1. If you have a rodent problem, they'll drop off mouse traps for you to set yourself if they don't know where to put them. God forbid they ask you.  But hey they don't think setting mouse traps is a big deal or dangerous, especially for people whose livelihoods depends on the use of all their fingers. Don't worry Rent Champaign, I only need 9 fingers to perform surgery. 2. They don't care about code.  We are on the second floor with a balcony with no stairs leading down to the ground floor. I raised the concern that this is a code violation and by law there needs to be a back stairs in case there's a fire. Their response....it's not in the budget. I'm more than happy about moving out of this shithole after enduring it for 4 years.  I don't expect much with the price of rent we pay but I do expect rodent free and safe living conditions."
hxWqksXGHiwz2qINMb7FVQ,0QtRH_2RUgCdJVyQir0cyg,"I have been very disappointed with BMI management. Maintenance requests were either ignored or responses were slow (although the maintenance man, Gary, is awesome - great guy), and we continually dealt with issues with our neighbors with minimal response from management upon repeated complaints. We were initially told we would be living below graduate students, but it turned out to be fraternity brothers. The organization is poorly managed and employees are often unfriendly and incompetent. Additionally, they offered $25 off my rent to cover part of a telephone jack installation, and months later, they sent me a bill for that $25 dollars in addition to a $50 late fee. There are much better options available in the C-U area. Stay away."
